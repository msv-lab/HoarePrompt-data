The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `plen` or `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented to be less than `plen`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is False.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented to be less than `plen`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is False**
