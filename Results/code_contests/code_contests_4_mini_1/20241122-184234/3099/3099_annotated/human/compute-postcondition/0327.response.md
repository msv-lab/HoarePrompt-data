The value of `y1` is assigned to `False`. The previous value of `y1` is unknown, but we know that it is being set to `False`. The other variables (`y0`, `i`, `p1len`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `y1`.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and 'NO' is printed**.
