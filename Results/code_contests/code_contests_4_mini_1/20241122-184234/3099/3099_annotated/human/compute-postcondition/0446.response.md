Postcondition: ***`t` is a string derived from `q` based on the value of `p1len`. If `p1len` is 0, `t` contains the entire contents of `q` starting from index `p0len` (which is 0). If `p1len` is greater than 0, `t` contains elements of `q` starting from `p0len` up to but not including the last `p1len` elements of `q`. The set of letters in `t` has a non-empty intersection with `good_letters`, and `y1` can be either True or False.***
