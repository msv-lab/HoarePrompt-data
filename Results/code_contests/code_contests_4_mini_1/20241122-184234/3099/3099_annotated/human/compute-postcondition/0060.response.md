According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `plen`. For the loop to execute, `plen` must be greater than 0. Currently, `plen` is 0, which means the loop will not execute. Therefore, to satisfy the loop condition, `plen` needs to be adjusted to at least 1. Additionally, since the loop uses `i`, it should start from 0.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`y` is True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0**
