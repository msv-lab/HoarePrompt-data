Postcondition: ***`y1` is True initially, and if the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` is set to False, and 'NO' is printed, indicating a mismatch. If the characters match, no changes occur to `y1` or the program state, and execution continues beyond the if statement. The process ensures that the comparison is valid since `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?' ensuring no unexpected behavior.***
