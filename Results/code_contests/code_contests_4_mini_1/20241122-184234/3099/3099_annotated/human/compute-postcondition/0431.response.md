The value of `y1` is assigned to `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The values of `i` and `p1len` remain unchanged, and the output state remains as 'NO'. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'**
