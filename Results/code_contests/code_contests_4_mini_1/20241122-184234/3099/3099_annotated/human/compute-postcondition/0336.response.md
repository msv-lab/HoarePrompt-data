Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found. `y1` is set to False if a character in `p1` is equal to '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if any character in `p1` does not equal the corresponding character in `qr`. If neither condition is met for all iterations, `y1` remains True, indicating a match was found. If `p1` is empty (i.e., `p1len` is 0), the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True, indicating that a match was found without checks. If `p1len` is greater than 0, then `i` ranges from 0 to `p1len-1`, ensuring valid access to `p1[i]` and `qr[i]`.**
