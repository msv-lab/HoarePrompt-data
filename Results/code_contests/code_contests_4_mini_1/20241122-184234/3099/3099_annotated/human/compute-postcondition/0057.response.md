The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes occur to the variables, but the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
