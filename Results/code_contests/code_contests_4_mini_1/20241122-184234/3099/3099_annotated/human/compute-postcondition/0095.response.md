Output State: **If `plen` is greater than 0, then `y` is True if all corresponding characters in `p` and `q` match or if `p[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`. If any character in `p` is not equal to the corresponding character in `q` or if `p[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is False, and 'NO' is printed, exiting the loop. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True.**
