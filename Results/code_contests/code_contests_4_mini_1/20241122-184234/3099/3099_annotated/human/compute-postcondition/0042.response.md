Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string with `plen` greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, and `i` is 2. If `q[i]` is not found in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y` or the flow of control.***
