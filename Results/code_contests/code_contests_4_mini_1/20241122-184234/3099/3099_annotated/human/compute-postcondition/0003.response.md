The variable `plen` is assigned the value of `len(p)`, which calculates the length of the input string `p`. The other variables (`good_letters` and `pattern`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new variable `plen`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*"; `p` is an input string from raw_input(); `plen` is the length of `p`**
