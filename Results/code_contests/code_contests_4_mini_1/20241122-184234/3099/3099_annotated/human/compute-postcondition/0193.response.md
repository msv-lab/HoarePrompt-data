Postcondition: ***`y0` retains its previous value unless `p0[i]` is equal to '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, in which case `y0` is set to False and 'NO' is printed; otherwise, if `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` is also set to False and 'NO' is printed. If both conditions are not met, `y0` remains unchanged. The index `i` is less than `p0len`, while `p0`, `q`, and `good_letters` remain unchanged.***
