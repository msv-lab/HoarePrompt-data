The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop.
