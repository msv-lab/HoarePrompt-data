The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state indicates that `y1` was `True`, but now it changes to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `y1`.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` at index `i` is not equal to '?', and the first element of `p1` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `qr` at index `i`, and the output is 'NO'**
