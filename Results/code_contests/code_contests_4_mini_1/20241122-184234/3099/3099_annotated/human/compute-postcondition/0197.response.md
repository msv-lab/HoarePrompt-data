The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, no changes occur to `y0` or any other variables. 

Output State: **`y0` is False, indicating that either there was a mismatch between corresponding characters in `p0` and `q`, or `p0[i]` was '?' and `q[i]` was not in `good_letters` for at least one index `i` from 0 to `p0len - 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
