The value of `y` is assigned to `False`, changing its initial value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables `plen`, `n`, `qlen`, and `i` remain unaffected. The printed output 'NO' does not alter the state of the variables either. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is False, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed**.
