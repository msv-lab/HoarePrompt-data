Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is initially True, and `i` is 2. If `p1[i]` is '?', and if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output will be 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If `p1[i]` is not '?', and if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the output will be 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` remains True. In all cases, `y0` is unaffected and retains its original boolean value.***
