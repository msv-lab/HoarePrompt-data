Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True and remains unchanged if `p[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, or if `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`. If `p[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, while `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` remain unchanged.***
