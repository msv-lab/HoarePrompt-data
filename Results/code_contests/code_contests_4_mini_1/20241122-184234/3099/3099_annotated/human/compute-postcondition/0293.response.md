Postcondition: ***`p0` and `q` are valid strings with `p0len` greater than 2, and `i` is equal to 2. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is a '?' but the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, there is no change to `y0` and no output occurs. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks. If the characters at index 2 of `p0` and `q` are equal, the program continues without changes to `y0` or output.***
