Postcondition: ***`y0` retains its previous value, and if `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` remains unchanged, and all other variables (`p0`, `q`, `good_letters`) remain unchanged.***
