The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. This action does not affect the values of any existing variables, including `y0`, `y1`, `t`, `n`, `q`, and `qlen`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement has executed, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of `q`, and 'NO' has been printed.**
