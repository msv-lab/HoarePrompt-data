The value of `y` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `plen`, `n`, `qlen`) remain unchanged, and 'NO' has already been printed. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `qlen` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `qlen` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed**
