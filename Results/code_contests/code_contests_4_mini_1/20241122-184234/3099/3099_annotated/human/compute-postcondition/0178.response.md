Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `p` is a string containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before "*", `p1` is the substring after "*", `p1` is the reversed string of its previous value, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1` (which must be less than `p0len` for the loop to continue). If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases, the program continues executing without any changes to `y0` or output.***
