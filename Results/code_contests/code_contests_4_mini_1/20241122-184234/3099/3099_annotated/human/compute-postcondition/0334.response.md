Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found. If `p1[2]` is a question mark and `qr[2]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[2]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains unchanged and the program continues without printing anything. If `p1[2]` is not a question mark and `p1[2]` is not equal to `qr[2]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Throughout, `i` is equal to 2 and `p1len` is greater than 2, ensuring safe access to `p1[i]` and `qr[i]` without out-of-bounds errors.***
