The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the other variables (`y`, `plen`, `n`, and `qlen`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the output to the console is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the output to the console is 'NO'**
