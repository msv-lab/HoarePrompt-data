Postcondition: ***`y1` is True initially, and if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, `i` remains 1, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed while breaking out of the most internal loop. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur to `y1`, `i`, or `p1len` and 'NO' is not printed.***
