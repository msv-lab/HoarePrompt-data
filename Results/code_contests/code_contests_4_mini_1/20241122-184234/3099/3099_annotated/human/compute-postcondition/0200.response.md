The code attempts to reverse the variable `q`, but there is no information provided about `q`, so we cannot determine its value or how it impacts the output state. The variables `y0` and `y1` remain unaffected by the operation. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value; `y1` is True; and the variable `q` is not defined or its state is unknown.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value; `y1` is True; and the variable `q` is not defined or its state is unknown.**
