The code snippet executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables are not changed or affected by this operation. The variable states prior to the print statement are still valid.

Output State: **`y` is True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` in `p` is not '?', and the character at index `i` in `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, and 'NO' is printed.**
