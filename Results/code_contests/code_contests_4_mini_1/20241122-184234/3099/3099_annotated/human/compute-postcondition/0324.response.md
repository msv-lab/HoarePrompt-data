Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found. If `p1[i]` is a question mark and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution exits. If `p1[i]` is a question mark and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, then the values of `y0`, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged. If `p1[i]` does not equal `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution exits. If `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, then no changes are made to `y1`, and the program continues executing beyond this fragment. Given that `i` is initialized to 1 and `p1len` is greater than 1, it is crucial that `i` remains within valid bounds for `p1` and `qr`.***
