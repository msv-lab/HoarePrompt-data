The `continue` statement is encountered, which causes the loop to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string from raw_input(), `plen` is the length of `p`, `n` is greater than 0, loop variable is 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and the output is 'NO' while the loop continues to the next iteration.
