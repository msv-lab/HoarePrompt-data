Output State: **`y` is a boolean value indicating whether all conditions were satisfied during the loop execution. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output will be 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the loop terminates. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True and continues to the next iteration. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output will be 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the loop terminates. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y` remains unchanged, and the loop continues. If `plen` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains as True. If `plen` is greater than 0 but all elements in `p` are either '?' with corresponding `q` letters in `good_letters` or equal to their corresponding `q` letters, `y` will remain True.**
