The `break` statement causes an exit from the most internal loop or if statement in which it resides. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is True, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `i` is 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, the first element of `p0` at index `i` is equal to '?', the character `q[0]` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
