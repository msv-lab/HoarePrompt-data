Output State: **`y0` is False if any character at index `i` of `p0` is equal to '?' and the corresponding character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if any characters at index `i` of `p0` and `q` do not match. Otherwise, `y0` remains True. `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is less than `p0len`. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True, `y1` is unchanged, `t` is assigned based on `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is obtained from `raw_input()`, and `qlen` is the length of `q`.**
