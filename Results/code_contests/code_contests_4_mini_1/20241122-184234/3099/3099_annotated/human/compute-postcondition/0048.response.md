To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we analyze the provided conditions and the current values.

1. The loop iterates over `i` in the range of `plen`, which means it will continue as long as `i` is less than `plen`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.
3. The value of `plen` should be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing, since the initial value of `i` is 2.

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and there are no modifications to other variables that affect the loop's conditions, the only necessary adjustment is to increase `i` by 1 and ensure that `plen` is greater than the current value of `i`.

Thus, the state adjustments are as follows:

- `i` should be increased to 3 for the next iteration.
- `plen` must be greater than 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the final state would be:

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is a string with length greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string with length `qlen`, `i` is 3, and `plen` is greater than 3**
