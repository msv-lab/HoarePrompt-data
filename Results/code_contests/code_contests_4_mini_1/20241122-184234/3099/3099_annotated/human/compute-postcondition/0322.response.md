The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
