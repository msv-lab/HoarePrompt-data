The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables. 

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is True, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 1; 'NO' is printed to the console**.
