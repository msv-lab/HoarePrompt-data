The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
