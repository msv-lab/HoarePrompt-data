The code prints 'NO' to the output. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, and `t` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variable state. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes were made to the variables and indicates the printed output.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned the value based on conditions, and the output is 'NO'**
