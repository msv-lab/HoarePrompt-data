Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is a string with length greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string with length `qlen`, and `i` is equal to 2. If the character at index 2 of string `p` does not match the character at index 2 of string `q`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters at index 2 of `p` and `q` are equal, there is no change to `y`, and the program continues execution without printing 'NO'.***
