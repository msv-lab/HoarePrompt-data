Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` remains unchanged, and `t` is assigned the value `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is equal to 0, or `q[p0len:-p1len]` if `p1len` is greater than 0. If there is at least one character in `t` that exists in `good_letters`, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues without printing anything.***
