Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True, `i` is 1, and `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged, and 'NO' is not printed. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True, `i` stays 1, and the values of `p1` and `qr` at index `i` are equal, with the length of `p1` ensuring that index `i` is valid.***
