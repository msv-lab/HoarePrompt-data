The execution of the code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `p0`, `q`, and `p0len` remain unchanged, and `i` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `p0` and `q` are valid strings, `p0len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the output 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`p0` and `q` are valid strings, `p0len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the output 'NO' is printed**
