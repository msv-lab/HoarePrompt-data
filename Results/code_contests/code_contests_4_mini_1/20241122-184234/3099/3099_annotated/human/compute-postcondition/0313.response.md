Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is set to False if the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, resulting in the output 'NO' and breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, no changes are made to `y1`, and the program continues execution, maintaining the preconditions.***
