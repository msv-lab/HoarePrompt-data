The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, and the function prints 'NO'.
