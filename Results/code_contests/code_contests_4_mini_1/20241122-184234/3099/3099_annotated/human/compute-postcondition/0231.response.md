The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The values of `y0` and `i` remain unchanged, and the program has previously printed 'NO', which does not alter any variable states. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `i` is 2**
