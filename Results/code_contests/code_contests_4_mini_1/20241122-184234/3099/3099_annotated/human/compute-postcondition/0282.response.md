Postcondition: ***If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` remains True, `y1` remains True, `n` continues to be greater than the current iteration count, `q` is a valid input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `i` is still 1, and `p0len` is greater than 0.***
