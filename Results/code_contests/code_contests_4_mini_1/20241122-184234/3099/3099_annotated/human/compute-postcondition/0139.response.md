Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0 and `i` is incremented to be less than `plen`. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without modifying `y`. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the program continues with no changes to `y`. Thus, `y` only becomes False if either `q[i]` is not a good letter when `p[i]` is '?' or if `p[i]` does not equal `q[i]`.***
