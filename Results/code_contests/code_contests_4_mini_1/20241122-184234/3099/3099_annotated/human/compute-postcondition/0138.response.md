Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented to be less than `plen`. If the elements `p[i]` and `q[i]` are not equal, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the program continues without altering the value of `y`.***
