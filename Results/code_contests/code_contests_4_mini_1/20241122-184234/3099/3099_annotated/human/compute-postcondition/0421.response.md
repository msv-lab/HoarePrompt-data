The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `i` and `p1len` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**
