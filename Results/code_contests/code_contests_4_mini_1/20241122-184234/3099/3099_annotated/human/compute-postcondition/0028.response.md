According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` must be less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has just started executing. Since `plen` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `plen`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `good_letters`, `pattern`, `p`, `q`, `n`, and `qlen` do not change based on the loop execution.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string with `plen` greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, and `i` is 1.**
