The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `p0` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
