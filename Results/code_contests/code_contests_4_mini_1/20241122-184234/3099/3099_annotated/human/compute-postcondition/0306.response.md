The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `qr` is assigned the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, the element at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters.`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
