Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is a '?', and if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not found in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. If the character is found in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and the values of `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` are unchanged. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`, then 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. If they are equal, no changes occur to `y`, `plen`, `n`, `qlen`, or `i`. Thus, `y` will only be False if either the character in `p` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not a good letter, or if the characters at index `i` in both strings do not match. In all other cases, `y` remains True.***
