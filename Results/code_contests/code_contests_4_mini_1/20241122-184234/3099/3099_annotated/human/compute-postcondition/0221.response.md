`y1` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value of `True` to `False`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed**
