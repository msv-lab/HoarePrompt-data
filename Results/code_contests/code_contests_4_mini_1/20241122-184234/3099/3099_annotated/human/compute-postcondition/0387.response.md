The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
