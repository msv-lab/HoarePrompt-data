Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is a string with length greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string with length `qlen`, and `i` is equal to 2. If the character at index 2 of string `p` is '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y`. If the character at index 2 of string `p` is not '?', and if it does not match the character at index 2 of string `q`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If both characters match, there is no change to `y`, and the program continues execution. All edge cases related to the values of `p[i]`, `q[i]`, and their membership in `good_letters` are handled appropriately.***
