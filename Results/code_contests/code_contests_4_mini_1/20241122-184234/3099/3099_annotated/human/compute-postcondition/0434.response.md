Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True, `i` is 1, and `p1len` is greater than 1. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True and continues executing. Thus, after the execution, `y1` can be either True or False depending on the conditions checked, and `i` remains unchanged at 1 unless the program breaks out of the loop.***
