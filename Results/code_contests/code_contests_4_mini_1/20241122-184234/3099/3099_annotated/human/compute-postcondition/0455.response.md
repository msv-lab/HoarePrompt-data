Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", and `p` is an input string. If `n` is greater than 0 and `*` is not in `p`, for each input string `q` of length `qlen`, if `qlen` equals `plen` and all corresponding characters in `p` match according to the rules (with '?' matching any character from `good_letters`), then 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is 0, no output is generated. If `*` is in `p`, for each input string `q`, if `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed. If `qlen` is sufficient, it checks if the beginning of `q` matches `p0` and the reversed end of `q` matches `p1`, with `t` containing no characters from `good_letters`. If both conditions are satisfied, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `plen` is 0, 'YES' is printed immediately if the loop executes, since there are no characters to compare. Therefore, the output reflects whether the input strings match the pattern based on the aforementioned conditions.***
