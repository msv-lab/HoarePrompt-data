According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `p1len` is greater than 0 (since it is stated that `p1len` is greater than 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

Since there are no additional conditions or changes to the state of `y0`, `y1`, `p1`, or `qr` mentioned that would affect the next iteration, only the value of `i` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is initially True, `i` is 1**
