Postcondition: ***`y1` is True if `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`; otherwise, `y1` is set to False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, and the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?'. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
