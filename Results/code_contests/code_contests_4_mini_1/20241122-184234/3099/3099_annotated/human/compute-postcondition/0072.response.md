Postcondition: ***`y` is True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0, and if the character at index `i` in `p` does not match the character at index `i` in `q`, then `y` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the most internal loop is exited. If the characters match, the execution continues without setting `y` to False or breaking the loop.***
