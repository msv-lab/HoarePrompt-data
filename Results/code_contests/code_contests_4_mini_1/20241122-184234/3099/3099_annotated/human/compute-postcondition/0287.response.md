The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p0` is a valid string, `q` is a valid string, `p0len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `y0` is False, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
