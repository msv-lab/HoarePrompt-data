Postcondition: ***`p0` and `q` are valid strings. If `p0[i]` is equal to '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. If `p0[i]` is equal to '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y0` remains True, allowing the iteration to continue. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, both `y0` and `y1` remain True, ensuring that the iteration can continue, with `n` still greater than the current iteration count, `i` equal to 1, and `p0len` greater than 0.***
