Postcondition: ***`y1` is True initially. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False. If neither condition triggers, `y1` remains True, indicating a match or valid character substitution. The process ensures that all comparisons are valid since `i` is 0 and `p1len` is greater than 0, thus confirming that the function handles cases where `p1[i]` is a wildcard or a specific character.***
