The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged: `y` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, and `qlen` is unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `qlen` is unchanged, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `qlen` is unchanged, and the function prints 'NO'**
