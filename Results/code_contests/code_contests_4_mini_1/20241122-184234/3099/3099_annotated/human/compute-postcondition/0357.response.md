The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration without executing any subsequent statements in the loop body. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of `q`, and 'NO' has been printed.
