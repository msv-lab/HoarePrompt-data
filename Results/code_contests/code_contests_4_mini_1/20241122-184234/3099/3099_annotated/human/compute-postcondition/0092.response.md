Postcondition: ***`y` is True initially and `i` is incremented by 1. If the elements at index `i` in arrays `p` and `q` are not equal, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the elements are equal, `y` remains True, and the values of `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` remain unchanged.***
