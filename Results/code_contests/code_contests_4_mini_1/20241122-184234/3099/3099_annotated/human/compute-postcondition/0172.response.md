Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `p` is a string containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before "*", `p1` is the substring after "*", `p1` is the reversed string of its previous value, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is set to True, and `i` is 0. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the characters at the current index do not match. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the program continues without any changes to `y0` or breaking out of the loop.***
