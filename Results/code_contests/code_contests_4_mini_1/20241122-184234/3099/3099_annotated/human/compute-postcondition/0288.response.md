Postcondition: ***`p0` and `q` are valid strings with `p0len` greater than 2 and `i` equal to 2. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, there is no change to `y0` and no output occurs from this block.***
