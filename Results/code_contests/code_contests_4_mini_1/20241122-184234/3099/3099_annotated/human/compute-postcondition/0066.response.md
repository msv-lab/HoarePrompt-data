Postcondition: ***`y` is True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0, and if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False and the loop is exited. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without changing `y`.***
