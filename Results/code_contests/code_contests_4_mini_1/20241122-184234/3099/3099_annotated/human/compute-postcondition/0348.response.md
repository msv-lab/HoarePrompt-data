The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, and `t` do not change due to this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as before, indicating that `y0` is a boolean indicating whether a match was found, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is still based on conditions, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned the value based on conditions, and the output is 'NO'**
