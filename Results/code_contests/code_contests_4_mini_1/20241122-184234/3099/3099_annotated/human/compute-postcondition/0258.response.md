Postcondition: ***`y0` is true, `y1` is true, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, the output is 'NO'. If `qlen` is equal to or greater than `plen - 1`, there is no output or action taken in this block.***
