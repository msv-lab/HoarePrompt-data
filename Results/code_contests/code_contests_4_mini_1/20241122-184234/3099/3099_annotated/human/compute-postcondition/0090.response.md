The value of `y` is changed from `True` to `False`. The other variables, `i`, `plen`, `n`, and `qlen`, remain unchanged. The function previously printed 'NO', but that output is not affected by the assignment of `y`. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `qlen` is unchanged, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `qlen` is unchanged, and the function prints 'NO'**
