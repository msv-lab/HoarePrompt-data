The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, so now it changes to `False`. The other variables (`y0`, `i`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new value of `y1` while retaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed**
