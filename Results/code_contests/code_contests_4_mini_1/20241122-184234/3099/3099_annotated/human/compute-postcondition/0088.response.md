Postcondition: ***If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. `i` is incremented by 1, while `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` remain unchanged. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur to `y`, `i`, `plen`, `n`, or `qlen`, and the program continues without printing 'NO'.***
