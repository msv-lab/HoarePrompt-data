Output State: **`y0` is True if all characters in `p0` match the corresponding characters in `q`, or if `p0[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters` for all indices `i` from 0 to `p0len - 1`. If there is a mismatch between `p0[i]` and `q[i]`, or if `p0[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y0` is set to False, and 'NO' is printed. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True.**
