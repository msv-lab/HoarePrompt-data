Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is set to False, and if the element at index `i` of the list `p` is not equal to the element at index `i` of the list `q`, the output is 'NO' and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition involving `p[i]` and `q[i]` is not met, the values of `y`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.***
