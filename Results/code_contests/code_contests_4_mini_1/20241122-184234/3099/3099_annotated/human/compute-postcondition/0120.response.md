According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the current value of `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is greater than 0, which means that the loop has executed at least once. 

The variable `i` must be incremented with each iteration of the loop. If the loop is to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1. Therefore, I need to adjust `i` to reflect the next iteration's starting point.

If `i` was at the last valid index of the loop before the next iteration, the new value of `i` should be equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1. 

Since the loop executes for the range of `plen`, and it has executed once, the condition for the loop to execute again requires `i` to be less than `plen`. Hence, `i` must be set to the previous value plus 1.

State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is a boolean value, `i` is the next index (previous value of `i` + 1)**
