The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The variables `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` are not affected by this print statement. The values of these variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the printed output.

Output State: **`y1` is True, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**
