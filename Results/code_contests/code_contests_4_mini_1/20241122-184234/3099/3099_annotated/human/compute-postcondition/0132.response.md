The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of `plen` and `i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented to be less than `plen`, `y` is False, and the output is 'NO'**
