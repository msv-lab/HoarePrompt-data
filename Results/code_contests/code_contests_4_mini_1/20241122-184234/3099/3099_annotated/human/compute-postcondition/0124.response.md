Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, the output will be 'NO'. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues execution without altering `y` or breaking.***
