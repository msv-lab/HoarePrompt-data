Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is initially True, and `i` is 2. If the condition `p1[i] != qr[i]` is true, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, `y1` remains True, and no changes occur to `y0` or `i`.***
