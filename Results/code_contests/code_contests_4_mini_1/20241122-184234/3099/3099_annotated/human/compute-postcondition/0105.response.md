The variable `y` is assigned the value `True`, and it was already `True`. Therefore, the state of the variable `y` remains unchanged. The values of `plen` and `n` are not affected by this assignment either. The output state reflects that `y` is still `True` and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1**
