According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p1len`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to 2, and `p1len` is greater than 2. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `p1len` must be greater than 3 to ensure safe access to `p1[i]` and `qr[i]`.

State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `p1len` is greater than 3**
