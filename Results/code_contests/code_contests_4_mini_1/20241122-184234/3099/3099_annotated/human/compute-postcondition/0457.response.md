Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of `good_letters`, a pattern string `p` which may include wildcards ('?' for any character and '*' for zero or more characters), and a number of queries `n`. For each query string `q`, it checks if `q` matches the pattern based on the provided rules: if `*` is not in `p`, it must match `p` exactly considering wildcards; if `*` is present, `q` must match the beginning and end of `p` while ensuring that the middle section does not contain any of the `good_letters`. It prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these checks, but it does not handle cases where the input may be invalid (e.g., non-integer inputs for `n`). If `n` is 0, the function does not produce any output.**
