Output State: **`y1` will be True if all characters in `p1` match the corresponding characters in `qr` or if `p1[i]` is a '?' that corresponds to a character in `good_letters`. If any character in `p1` at index `i` does not match the corresponding character in `qr`, or if `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` becomes False and the loop breaks. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True.**
