The value of `y1` is changed from `True` to `False`. The value of `y0` remains unchanged as it is a separate boolean value, and `i` is also unaffected. The print statement outputs 'NO', but it does not change any variable state. Therefore, the output state is `y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `i` is 2**
