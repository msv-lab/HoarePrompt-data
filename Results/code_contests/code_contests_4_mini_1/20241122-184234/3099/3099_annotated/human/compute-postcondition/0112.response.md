Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is a boolean where if the element at index `i` of list `q` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the element at index `i` of list `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and no changes occur to `y` or the program flow.***
