Postcondition: ***If `q[i]` is the same as `p0[i]`, the program continues executing without changes to `y0` or output. If `p0[i]` is a question mark, and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p0[i]` does not equal `q[i]`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and also breaks out of the loop. Therefore, `y0` will be False if either a mismatch occurs between `p0[i]` and `q[i]` or if `q[i]` is not an acceptable character when `p0[i]` is a question mark. In all other cases where `p0[i]` and `q[i]` match, `y0` retains its previous value.***
