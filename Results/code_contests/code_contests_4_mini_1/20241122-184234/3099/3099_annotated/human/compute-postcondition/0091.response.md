The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `qlen` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement while the function prints 'NO'.
