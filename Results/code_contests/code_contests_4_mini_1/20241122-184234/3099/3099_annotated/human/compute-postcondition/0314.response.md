Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is set to False if the character at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?' and the character at index `i` of `qr` (the reversed value of `q`) is not in `good_letters`, resulting in the output 'NO'. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` is also set to False, leading to the output 'NO' and breaking out of the loop. If neither condition triggers, `y1` remains True, indicating a match was found. Additionally, since `i` is initialized to 0 and `p1len` is greater than 0, the character at `p1[0]` is guaranteed to be a '?', ensuring that the first part of the condition is checked.***
