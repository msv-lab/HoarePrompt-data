Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string with `plen` greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `p` does not equal the character at index `i` of string `q`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If they are equal, no changes occur to `y`, and the program continues execution beyond this point.
