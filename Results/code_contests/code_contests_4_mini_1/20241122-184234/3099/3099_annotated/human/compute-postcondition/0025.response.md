The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 0, the character at position `i` in string `p` is not '?', and the character at position `i` in string `p` is different from the character at position `i` in string `q`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
