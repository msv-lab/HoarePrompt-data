Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True, `i` is 1, and `p1len` is greater than 1. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y1` remains True, and no changes occur in the program state.***
