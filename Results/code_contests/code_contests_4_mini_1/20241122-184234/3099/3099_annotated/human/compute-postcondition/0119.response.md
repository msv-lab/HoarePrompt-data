Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is a boolean value. If the element at index `i` of list `p` is '?', and if the element at index `i` of list `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the element at index `i` of list `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and no changes occur to `y` or the program flow. If the element at index `i` of list `p` is not equal to the element at index `i` of list `q`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If neither of these conditions is met, the values of `y`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. All checks ensure that the program correctly evaluates the conditions based on the elements at index `i` of both lists.***
