The break statement does not change the values of the variables, but it causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `i` is the next index, and we break out of the most internal loop.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `i` is the next index, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
