The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` is unknown, and the values of `y0`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged. The output remains 'NO'. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the output is 'NO'**
