Postcondition: ***`p0` and `q` are valid strings, `p0len` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If the character at index 2 of `p0` is not equal to the character at index 2 of `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters at index 2 are equal, the program continues without making any changes to `y0` or printing 'NO'.***
