The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` at index `i` is not equal to '?', the first element of `p1` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `qr` at index `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
