Postcondition: ***`y0` is true, `y1` is unchanged, and the value of `t` is assigned based on the length of `p1`, such that if `p1len` is equal to 0, `t` is equal to `q[p0len:]`, or if `p1len` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to `q[p0len:-p1len]`. In addition, there are no characters in `t` that exist in `good_letters`.***
