Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, if `p[i]` is equal to '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output will be 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues execution without altering `y`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output will be 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y` remains unchanged and the loop continues.***
