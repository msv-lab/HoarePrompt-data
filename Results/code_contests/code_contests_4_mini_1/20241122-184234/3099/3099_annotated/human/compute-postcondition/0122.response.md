The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous boolean state. The values of `plen`, `i`, and the output do not change. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `i` is the next index (previous value of `i` + 1), and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `i` is the next index (previous value of `i` + 1), and the output is 'NO'**
