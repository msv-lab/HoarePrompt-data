The variable `t` is assigned the value `None`. The states of the other variables (`y1` and `p1len`) are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` is now `None`, while `y1` remains False (if the loop is set to execute) or True (if the loop does not execute due to `p1len` being 0), and `p1len` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is None, `y1` is either True or False, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0**
