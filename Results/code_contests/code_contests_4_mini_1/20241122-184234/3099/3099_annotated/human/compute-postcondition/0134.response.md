Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0 and `i` is incremented to be less than `plen`. If the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases where `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program execution continues without modifying `y` or producing output.***
