Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, which means that either a character in `p1` is equal to '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or at least one character in `p1` does not equal the corresponding character in `qr`. If `p1` is not empty, then `i` ranges from 0 to `p1len-1`, ensuring valid access to `p1[i]` and `qr[i]`.***
