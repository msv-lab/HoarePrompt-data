Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of `q`, 'NO' has been printed if `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, and the program continues without printing anything if `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`.**
