Postcondition: ***`y0` is True or False depending on whether the character `q[i]` is in `good_letters`. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop. `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `p0` at index `i` is equal to '?'***
