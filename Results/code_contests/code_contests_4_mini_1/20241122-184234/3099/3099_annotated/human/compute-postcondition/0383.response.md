Postcondition: ***`y0` is False if the character at index 1 of `p0` is '?' and the character at index 1 of `q` is not in `good_letters`, in which case 'NO' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. Additionally, `y0` is also False if the character at index 1 of `p0` does not match the character at index 1 of `q`, leading to 'NO' being printed and breaking out of the loop. In all other cases, `y0` remains True, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.***
