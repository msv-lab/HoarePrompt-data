Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string with `plen` greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, `y` is False if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, otherwise `y` remains True. The character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark ('?'), and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the condition is met.***
