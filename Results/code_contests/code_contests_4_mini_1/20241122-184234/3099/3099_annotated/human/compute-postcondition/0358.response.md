Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of `q`, if `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' has been printed. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, the program continues without printing anything.***
