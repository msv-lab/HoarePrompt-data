The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not change the values of any variables in the current state. The values of `y0`, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is the same, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is the same, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the output is 'NO'**
