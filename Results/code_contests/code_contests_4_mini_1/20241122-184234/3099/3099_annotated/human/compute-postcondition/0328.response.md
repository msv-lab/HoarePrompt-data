The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
