The variable `K` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string `S` remains unchanged, and the specific value of `K` is not defined in this context, only that it is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Therefore, the output state is: `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters**
