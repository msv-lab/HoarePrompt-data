The code prints the first `K` characters of the string `S` followed by '...'. Given that `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and the length of `S` is greater than `K`, the slice `S[:K]` will take the first `K` characters from `S`. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `S` is the input string consisting of lowercase English letters, and the output is S[:K] + '...'**
