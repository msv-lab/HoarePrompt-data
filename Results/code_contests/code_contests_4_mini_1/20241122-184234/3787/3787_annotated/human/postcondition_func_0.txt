The function accepts an integer `K` (input by the user) and a string `S` (also input by the user). It prints the string `S` in its entirety if its length is less than or equal to `K`. If the length of `S` exceeds `K`, it prints the first `K` characters of `S` followed by an ellipsis ('...'). The function always returns 0. Note that the function does not validate the inputs for `K` or `S`, so if `K` is outside the expected range (1 to 100) or if `S` contains non-lowercase English letters, this could lead to undefined behavior.
