Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads an integer `K` from input, which represents the maximum length allowed for the string `S`.
2. It reads the string `S`, ensuring to strip any leading or trailing whitespace.
3. It checks the length of `S` against `K`:
   - If the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`, it prints `S` unchanged.
   - If the length of `S` is greater than `K`, it prints the first `K` characters of `S` followed by `...`.

The program adheres to the constraints provided:
- `K` is always between 1 and 100, and `S` is always a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100.
- The program handles both situations as specified in the problem statement.

All possible edge cases are covered:
- When `S` is exactly `K` characters long, it prints `S` correctly.
- When `S` is shorter than `K`, it also prints `S` correctly.
- When `S` is longer than `K`, it truncates `S` and appends `...`, which is the correct behavior.

Thus, there are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as True.
