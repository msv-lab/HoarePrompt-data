The value of `K` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `K` is unknown but is constrained to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The other variable `S` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters**
