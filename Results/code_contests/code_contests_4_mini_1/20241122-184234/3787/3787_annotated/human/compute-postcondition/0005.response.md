The code prints the first `K` characters of the string `S`, followed by an ellipsis (`...`). Given that `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and the length of `S` is greater than `K`, the substring `S[:K]` is valid and will contain the first `K` characters of `S`. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `S` is the input string after stripping whitespace; the output is `S[:K] + '...'`.**
