Postcondition: ***`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `S` is a string after stripping whitespace. If the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`, the function prints `S`. If the length of `S` is greater than `K`, the function prints the first `K` characters of `S` followed by '...'.***
