The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `K` and `S`. `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100 (inclusive). After executing the function body, the function returns 0 regardless of the input values. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `K` and a string `S`, and always return 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters K (an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive) and S (a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive), and it returns 0.**
