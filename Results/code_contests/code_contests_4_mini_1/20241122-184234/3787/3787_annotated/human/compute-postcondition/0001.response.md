The value of `S` is reassigned to the value obtained from `input().strip()`, which means it will take in a string from user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `K` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `S` is the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `S` is the input string after stripping whitespace**
