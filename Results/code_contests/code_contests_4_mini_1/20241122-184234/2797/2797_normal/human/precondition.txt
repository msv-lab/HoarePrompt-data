n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000, and the operations consist of pairs of integers where the first integer indicates the type of operation (1 for row, 2 for column), the second integer indicates the specific row or column (1-indexed), and the third integer indicates the color (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).
