According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `i` should be 3. Additionally, since `n` is greater than 1, it needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2 to ensure the loop continues to execute. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
