According to the code, the loop execution depends on the values of `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `m` is greater than 1, it is necessary that `m` is at least 4 for the loop to continue executing beyond the current iteration.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the adjusted states should reflect `i` becoming 3 and `m` being greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 3, `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`, `k` is decremented by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 3, and `l[b - 1][2]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
