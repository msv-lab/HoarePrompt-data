The value of `k` is decremented by 1, and its previous value was 1. After the execution of the code, `k` will be 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `l` are positive integers; `k` is 0; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `l` are positive integers; `k` is 0; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values from input**
