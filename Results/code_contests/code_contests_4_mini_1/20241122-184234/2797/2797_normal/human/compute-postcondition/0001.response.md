The code initializes a 2D list `l` with dimensions `n` by `m`, where each element is set to 0. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers as per the initial state. This does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `k`, but creates a new variable `l` that holds a list of lists.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and includes the new 2D list `l`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `l` is a 2D list of size n by m filled with zeros.**
