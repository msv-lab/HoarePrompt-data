According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will become 1. Additionally, `m` must remain greater than 1 for another iteration to be valid.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` becomes 1, and `m` should be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l[b - 1][0]` is assigned the value of `c`, `k` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 1**
