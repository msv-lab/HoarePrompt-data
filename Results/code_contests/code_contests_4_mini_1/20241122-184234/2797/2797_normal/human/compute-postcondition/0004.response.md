The code assigns values to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` by taking input from the user and converting that input into integers. The initial state of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` remains unchanged since the input values do not affect them. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and indicate that `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list of size n by m filled with zeros, and `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input.**
