According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The condition for the loop to run again is satisfied because `i` (which will be 2) is still less than `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l[b - 1][0]` is assigned the value of `c`, `k` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`**
