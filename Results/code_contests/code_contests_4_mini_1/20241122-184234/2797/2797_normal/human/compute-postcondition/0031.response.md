According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `m` is greater than 1, it will allow for the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`, `k` is decremented by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 2**
