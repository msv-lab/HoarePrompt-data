The value of `k` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `l`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `l` are positive integers, and `k` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `l` are positive integers; `k` is decreased by 1**
