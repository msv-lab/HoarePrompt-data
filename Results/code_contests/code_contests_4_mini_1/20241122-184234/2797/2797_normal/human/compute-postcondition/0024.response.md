According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer, so it is already greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, and `l` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m`**
