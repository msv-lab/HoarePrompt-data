The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is a positive integer, so after execution, the new value of `k` will be one less than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `l`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, and `l` is a 2D list of size n by m filled with zeros.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, and `l` is a 2D list of size n by m filled with zeros**
