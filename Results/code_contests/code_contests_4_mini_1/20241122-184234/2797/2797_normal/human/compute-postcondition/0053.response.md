The code assigns the value of `c` to `l[b - 1][i]`, where `i` is 2. The initial state indicates that `l[b - 1][0]` and `l[b - 1][1]` have already been assigned the value of `c`. The previous values of the affected variables are `l[b - 1][0]` is `c`, `l[b - 1][1]` is `c`, and now `l[b - 1][i]` (which is `l[b - 1][2]`) will also be assigned the value of `c`. Therefore, after execution of the code, the state of `l[b - 1][2]` will also be `c`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l[b - 1][0]` is `c`, `k` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 2, `l[b - 1][1]` is `c`, and `l[b - 1][2]` is `c`**
