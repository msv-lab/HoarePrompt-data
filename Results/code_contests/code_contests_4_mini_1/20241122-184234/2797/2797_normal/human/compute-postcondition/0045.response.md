According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is decreased by 1, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be at least 1 before this iteration. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to 1 or greater.

State: **`n`, `m`, `l` are positive integers; `k` is 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values from input**
