According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, it will still be greater than `i`. 

No other states need to be adjusted in this case. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `l` is modified at index [0][b - 1] with the value of `c`, `k` is 0, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is an input value, `i` is 1**
