According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. Since `m` is a positive integer, as long as `m` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. 

No other states need to be adjusted because `n`, `k`, `l[b - 1][i]`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l[b - 1][i]` is `c`, `a` is 1, `b` is an integer from input, `c` is an integer from input, `i` is 2**
