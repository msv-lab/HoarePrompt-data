You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see examples of the loop executing several times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after the execution of the loop. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` had greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 or lower than one then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`, i equals n
Output State: **`if n is at least 1 then factorial` is the factorial of `n`, n is 0. if i is lower than 1 the loop doesnt execute and factorial is 1**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in thethe end students will be 0. if studenmts is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **`if students is greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to students, students is 0 at the end. if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**

Your Task:

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `l` is a 2D list of size n by m filled with zeros
Code of the loop:
```
while k > 0:
    k -= 1
    a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if a == 1:
        for i in range(m):
            l[b - 1][i] = c
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            l[i][b - 1] = c

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, and `l` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m`. If `a` is 1 and `b` is within the range from 1 to `n`, all elements in the row `b - 1` of `l` are set to `c` (with `l[b - 1][i] = c` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1`); if `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not 1 and `b` is within the range from 1 to `m`, all elements in the column `b - 1` of `l` are set to `c` (with `l[i][b - 1] = c` for `i` from `0` to `n - 1`); if `b` is less than 1 or greater than `m`, or if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains unchanged, filled with zeros. In the case of an invalid `b`, an index error occurs for column filling.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n`, `m`, `l` are positive integers; `k` is decreased by 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values from input. If `a` is 1, the first `m` indices of `l[b - 1]` are set to `c`, provided that `b - 1` is within the bounds of `l`. If `m` is 0, `l` remains unchanged and the variable `i` is not defined. If `a` is not 1, and if `n` is greater than 0, the first `n` indices of `l[i][b - 1]` are set to `c` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. In both cases, if `b - 1` exceeds the bounds of `l`, an error occurs when accessing `l[b - 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n`, `m`, `l` are positive integers; `k` is 0; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input. If `a` is 1, then for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`, which modifies the first `m` elements of the `b-1` index of the list `l` with `c`. If `m` is 0, no changes are made to `l[b - 1]`. If `a` is not 1 and `n` is greater than 0 with `b` within a valid range (1 to the length of `l`), then for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`, modifying the first `n` rows of the `b-1` column of `l` with `c`. If `n` is 0, no changes are made to `l`. If `b` is out of bounds, an index error occurs.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
