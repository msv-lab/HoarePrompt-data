According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n`, `m`, `l` are positive integers; `k` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input.**
