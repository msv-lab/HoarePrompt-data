Output State: **`l[b - 1][i]` will be assigned the value of `c` for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop executes `m` times, filling the first `m` elements of the `b-1` index of the list `l` with the value `c`. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values in `l[b - 1]` remain unchanged. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from input, and `i` will take values from `0` to `m-1` if the loop executes.**
