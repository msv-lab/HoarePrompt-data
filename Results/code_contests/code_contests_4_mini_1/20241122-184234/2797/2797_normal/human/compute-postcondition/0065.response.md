Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `l` are positive integers; `k` is 0; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input. If `a` is 1, then for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`, which modifies the first `m` elements of the `b-1` index of the list `l` with `c`. If `m` is 0, no changes are made to `l[b - 1]`. If `a` is not 1 and `n` is greater than 0 with `b` within a valid range (1 to the length of `l`), then for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`, modifying the first `n` rows of the `b-1` column of `l` with `c`. If `n` is 0, no changes are made to `l`. If `b` is out of bounds, an index error occurs.***
