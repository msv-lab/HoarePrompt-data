The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It performs operations based on the defined constraints: `n` and `m` are positive integers with values between 1 and 5000, and `k` is a positive integer with values between 1 and 100000. Each operation involves painting a row or a column with a color `ai`, where `ai` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function ultimately returns the final color of the cell located at the intersection of the nth row and mth column after all painting operations have been executed. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the final color of the cell at the intersection of the nth row and mth column after performing painting operations based on specified constraints.**
