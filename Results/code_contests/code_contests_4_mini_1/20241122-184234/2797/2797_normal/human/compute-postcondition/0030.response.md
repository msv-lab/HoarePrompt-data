The assignment `l[b - 1][i] = c` updates the value in the list `l`. The specific element being assigned is `l[b - 1][i]`, where `b` is a variable that has a value based on input, and `i` is 1. The value of `c`, which is also assigned from input, will replace the current value at that location in the list `l`. 

Since `l` is a positive integer array and `b` is greater than 1, `l[b - 1]` will reference a valid row in the list, and `i` is 1, ensuring we are updating the second element of that row. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and others remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `l[b - 1][1]` as `c`, while `n`, `m`, `l`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `i` retain their previous values or states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`, `k` is decremented by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 1**
