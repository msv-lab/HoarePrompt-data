Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where the column at index `b - 1` is filled with the value `c` for indices `0` through `n - 1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains a 2D list filled with zeros. If `b` is less than 1 or greater than `m`, the assignment operation will lead to an index error when attempting to access `l[i][b - 1]`, making it undefined behavior.**
