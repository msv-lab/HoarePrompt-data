The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input()`, which accepts a space-separated input and splits it into three integer values. The values of `n`, `m`, and `l` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variables assigned from the input, while the previous values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `l` are positive integers; `k` is decreased by 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values from input.**
