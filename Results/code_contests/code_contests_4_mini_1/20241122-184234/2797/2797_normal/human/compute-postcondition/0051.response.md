The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. Given that `i` is 1, the assignment updates the element in the list `l` at the position `[b - 1][1]` to the value of `c`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l[b - 1][0]` is assigned the value of `c`, `k` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 1, and `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l[b - 1][0]` is assigned the value of `c`, `k` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 1, and `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c**
