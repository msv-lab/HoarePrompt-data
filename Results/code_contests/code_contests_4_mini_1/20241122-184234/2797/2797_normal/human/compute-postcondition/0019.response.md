According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and we also need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 2, and `n` must be greater than 1 to allow another iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
