Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, and `l` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m`. If `a` is 1 and `b` is within the range from 1 to `n`, all elements in the row `b - 1` of `l` are set to `c` (with `l[b - 1][i] = c` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1`); if `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not 1 and `b` is within the range from 1 to `m`, all elements in the column `b - 1` of `l` are set to `c` (with `l[i][b - 1] = c` for `i` from `0` to `n - 1`); if `b` is less than 1 or greater than `m`, or if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains unchanged, filled with zeros. In the case of an invalid `b`, an index error occurs for column filling.***
