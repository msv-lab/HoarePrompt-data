Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `l` are positive integers; `k` is decreased by 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values from input. If `a` is 1, the first `m` indices of `l[b - 1]` are set to `c`, provided that `b - 1` is within the bounds of `l`. If `m` is 0, `l` remains unchanged and the variable `i` is not defined. If `a` is not 1, and if `n` is greater than 0, the first `n` indices of `l[i][b - 1]` are set to `c` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. In both cases, if `b - 1` exceeds the bounds of `l`, an error occurs when accessing `l[b - 1]`.***
