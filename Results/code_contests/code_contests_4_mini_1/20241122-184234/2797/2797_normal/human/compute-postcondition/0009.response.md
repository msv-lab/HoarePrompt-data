The statement `l[b - 1][i] = c` assigns the value of `c` to the location in the list `l` at row `b - 1` and column `i`. The previous value of `l[b - 1][i]` is not specified, but `l` has already been updated at position `[b - 1][0]` with the value of `c`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l[b - 1][i]` is `c`, `a` is 1, `b` is an integer from input, `c` is an integer from input, `i` is 1**
