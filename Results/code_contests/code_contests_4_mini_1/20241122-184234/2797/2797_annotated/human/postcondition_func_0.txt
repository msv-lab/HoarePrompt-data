The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, initializes a 2D list of size `n x m` with zeros, processes `k` update operations that modify either a specified row or column to a given value, and prints the final state of the list. If `n` or `m` is zero, the behavior is undefined, but it is assumed they are positive integers.
