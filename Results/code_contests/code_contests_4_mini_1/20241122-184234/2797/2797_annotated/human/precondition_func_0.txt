n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000, and each operation is defined by three integers where the first integer is either 1 or 2, the second integer is a valid row or column index, and the third integer is a positive integer representing the color (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).
