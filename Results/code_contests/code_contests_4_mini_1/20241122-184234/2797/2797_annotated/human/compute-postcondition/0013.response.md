Output State: **`l` has been updated at positions `[b - 1][0]` to `[b - 1][m - 1]` with the value `c`, where `b - 1` is a valid index within the range of `0` to `n - 1`. If `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute and `l` remains unchanged with all elements as 0. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains unchanged with all elements as 0. `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned values from input.**
