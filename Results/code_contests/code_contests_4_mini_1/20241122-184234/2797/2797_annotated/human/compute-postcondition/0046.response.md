The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since `k` is greater than 0, it will take on a new value that is still positive after the decrement. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing**
