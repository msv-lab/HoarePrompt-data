The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is updated to `c`. The previous values of `b` and `i` are known: `i` is 2 and `b` is a value greater than 1. Therefore, the expression `l[b - 1][i]` corresponds to `l[b - 1][2]`, and this is assigned the value of `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is now decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from user input, `i` is 2, `l[b - 1][2]` is updated to `c`.**
