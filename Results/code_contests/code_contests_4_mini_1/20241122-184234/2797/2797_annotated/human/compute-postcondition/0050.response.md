According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and since it should remain less than `m`, `m` should be at least 2 to allow one more iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing, `i` is 1, and the value of l[b - 1][i] is assigned the value of c.**
