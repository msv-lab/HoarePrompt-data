According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to 2. The value of `n` does not need to be changed since it is still a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `l[1][b - 1]` is assigned the value `c`, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is a user input value, `c` is a user input value, `i` is 2**
