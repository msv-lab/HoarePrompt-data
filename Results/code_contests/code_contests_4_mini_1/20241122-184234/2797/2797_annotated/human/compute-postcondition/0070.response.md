The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. It initializes a 2D list `l` of size `n x m` filled with zeros. The function then processes `k` operations, where each operation consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `a` is 1, the function updates the entire row `b - 1` of the list `l` to the value `c`. If `a` is not 1, it updates the entire column `b - 1` of the list `l` to the value `c`. If the indices `b` are out of bounds or if `m` is 0, no update occurs, and the list remains unchanged. After all operations, the function prints the final state of the list in a formatted manner. The code does not handle the case where `n` or `m` could be zero, which would lead to potential errors, but it is implied that they are positive integers. Overall, the function modifies the list based on the input operations and outputs the resulting list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, initializes a 2D list of size `n x m` with zeros, processes `k` update operations that modify either a specified row or column to a given value, and prints the final state of the list. If `n` or `m` is zero, the behavior is undefined, but it is assumed they are positive integers. **
