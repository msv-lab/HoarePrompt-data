In this case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from user input through `raw_input()`, which is split into separate string components and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this operation, but we know that `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing. 

Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot assign them exact values, but we can state they will be positive integers based on the input. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing, and `a`, `b`, `c` are input positive integers.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing, and `a`, `b`, `c` are input positive integers.**
