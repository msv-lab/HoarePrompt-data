The code assigns values to `a`, `b`, and `c` by taking input from the user, which is processed by `raw_input()`, split into components, and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which depend on user input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s; `k` is decreased by 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from user input**.
