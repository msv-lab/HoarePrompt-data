Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s. If `a` is 1, the elements of the list `l` at row `b - 1` are updated to the value `c` for all columns from `0` to `m - 1`, provided `1 <= b <= n` and `m > 0`. If `a` is not 1, the elements of the list `l` at column `b - 1` are updated to the value `c` for all rows from `0` to `n - 1`, provided `1 <= b <= m`. In both cases, if `b` is out of bounds (less than 1 or greater than `n` for the first case, or less than 1 or greater than `m` for the second), or if `m` is zero, the list `l` remains unchanged and filled with 0s.***
