The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged. The output state reflects the assignment made to the list `l` at the specified indices.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
