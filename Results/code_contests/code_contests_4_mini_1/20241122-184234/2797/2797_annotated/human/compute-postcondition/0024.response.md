According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is positive, which means it is currently greater than 0. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s; `k` is positive**.
