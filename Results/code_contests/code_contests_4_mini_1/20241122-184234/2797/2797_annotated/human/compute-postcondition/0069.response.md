The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000. The parameter `k` is also a positive integer constrained such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000. Additionally, the function processes a series of operations, each defined by three integers: the first integer indicates the type of operation (either 1 or 2), the second integer is a valid row or column index, and the third integer is a positive integer representing the color (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9). 

The function returns a result based on the operations applied to rows and columns, but the specific output is not detailed here. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and k, where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100000). It processes a series of operations defined by three integers indicating the operation type, index, and color, but details of the return value are not specified.**
