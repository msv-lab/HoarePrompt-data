According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` is still a positive integer, and the 2D list `l` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 0s except `l[0][b - 1]` is now `c`, `b` and `c` are assigned values from input, `i` is 1**
