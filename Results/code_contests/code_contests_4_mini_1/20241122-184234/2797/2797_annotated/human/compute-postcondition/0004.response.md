The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is split into three parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and the 2D list `l` are not directly affected by this assignment. However, the printed output is `0` repeated `n * m` times, which indicates that the focus is on the input values provided for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since no specific values for `a`, `b`, or `c` are provided in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values after execution.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 0s; printed output is `0` repeated `n * m` times; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input.**
