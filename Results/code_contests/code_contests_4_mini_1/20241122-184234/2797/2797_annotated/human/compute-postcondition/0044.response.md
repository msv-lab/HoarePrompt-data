Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the first `m` elements of row `b - 1` in the 2D list `l` are set to `c`, `k` is decreased by `m`, and `a`, `b`, `c` retain their user input values. If `m` is 0 or less, no changes are made to `l`, `k` is decreased by 1, and `a`, `b`, `c` retain their user input values. If `a` is not equal to 1 and `n` is at least 1, the first `n` elements of column `b - 1` in the 2D list `l` are set to `c`, and `k` is decreased by 1. If `n` is 0 or less, no changes are made to `l`, `k` is decreased by 1, and `a`, `b`, `c` retain their user input values. In all cases, `l` remains a 2D list filled with 0s if no updates occur.***
