Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. If `a` is equal to 1, then the first `m` elements of `l[b - 1]` are set to the value `c`, and if `m` is 0, `l[b - 1]` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to 1 and `n` is greater than 0, then the first `n` elements of `l[i][b - 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` are set to `c`, and if `n` is 0, the list `l` remains unchanged. In all cases, the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as initially defined.***
