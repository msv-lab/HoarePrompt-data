The value of `k` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The values of `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s; `k` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s; `k` is decreased by 1**
