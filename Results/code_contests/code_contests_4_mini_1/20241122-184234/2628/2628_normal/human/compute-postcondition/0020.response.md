The function `func` accepts a binary string `S` composed of characters '0' and '1', which is read from user input. It counts the number of '0's (`s0`) and '1's (`s1`) in the string. After processing the entire string, it prints the maximum count between `s0` and `s1`. The function does not handle cases where `S` is empty, which means that if the input is an empty string, the function will print `0`, as both counts will remain `0`. However, it is implied in the annotations that `S` should be a non-empty string, which does not account for this edge case. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a binary string `S` and counts the number of '0's and '1's in it, printing the maximum count between the two. If `S` is empty, it will print `0`. **
