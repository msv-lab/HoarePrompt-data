Output State: **`s0` is the count of '0's in the string `S`, `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `S`. If `S` is a non-empty string composed solely of '0's and '1's, the loop will execute for each character, updating `s0` or `s1` accordingly. If `S` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `s0` and `s1` remain 0.**
