The value of `s0` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `s0` is 0, after execution, `s0` becomes 1. The states of the other variables `S`, `s1`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's, `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0, and the first character `c` of `S` is '0'.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's, `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0, and the first character `c` of `S` is '0'**
