The value of `s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` can either be 0, 1, or 2, depending on the initial state. After the increment, `s1` can be 1, 2, or 3. The states of `S` and `s0` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 1, `s0` is either 2 or more, `s1` is either 1, 2, or 3.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 1, `s0` is either 2 or more, `s1` is either 1, 2, or 3**
