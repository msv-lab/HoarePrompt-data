Postcondition: ***`S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 1. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is increased by 1, making it either 3 or 2, while `s1` remains either 0 or 1. If `c` is '1', then `s1` is increased by 1, resulting in `s1` being either 2 or 3, while `s0` remains either 2 or more.***
