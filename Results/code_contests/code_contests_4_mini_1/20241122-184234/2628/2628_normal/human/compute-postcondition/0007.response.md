Postcondition: ***`S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's. If the first character `c` of `S` is '0', then `s0` is incremented to 1 and `s1` remains 0. Conversely, if `c` is '1', then `s1` is incremented to 1 and `s0` remains 0. Thus, either `s0` is 1 and `s1` is 0, or `s0` is 0 and `s1` is 1, ensuring that exactly one of `s0` or `s1` is incremented based on the first character of the string `S`.***
