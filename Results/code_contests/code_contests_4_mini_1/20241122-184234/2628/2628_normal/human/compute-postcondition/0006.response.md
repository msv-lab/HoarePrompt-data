The value of `s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` is 0, so after the execution, `s1` becomes 1. The values of `S`, `s0`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's, `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, and the first character `c` of `S` is '1'.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's, `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, and the first character `c` of `S` is '1'**
