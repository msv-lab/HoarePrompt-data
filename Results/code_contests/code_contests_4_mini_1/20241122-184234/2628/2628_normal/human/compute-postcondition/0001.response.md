The variables `s0` and `s1` are both initialized to `0`. The initial state of `S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1', but the specific content of `S` is not provided. The assignment does not affect the state of `S`. Therefore, after executing the code, `s0` and `s1` are both `0`, and `S` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 0, `s1` is 0**
