The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. Since `s0` can either be 1 or 0 in the initial state, it will become 2 or 1 respectively after the increment. The string `S` and the value of `s1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 1; `s0` is either 2 or 1; `s1` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 1; `s0` is either 2 or 1; `s1` is either 0 or 1**
