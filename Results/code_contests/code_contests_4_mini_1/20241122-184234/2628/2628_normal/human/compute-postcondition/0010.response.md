The value of `s1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s1` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, after execution, `s1` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables, `S` and `s0`, remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 1; `s0` is 1 and `s1` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 1; `s0` is 1 and `s1` is either 1 or 2**
