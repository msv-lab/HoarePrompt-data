Postcondition: ***`S` is a non-empty string of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 1. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is incremented by 1 (resulting in either 2 or more), and `s1` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1). If `c` is '1', then `s1` is incremented by 1 (resulting in either 1 or 2), and `s0` remains unchanged (either 1 or 2). In both cases, `s0` and `s1` are non-negative integers that reflect the counts of '0's and '1's processed so far.***
