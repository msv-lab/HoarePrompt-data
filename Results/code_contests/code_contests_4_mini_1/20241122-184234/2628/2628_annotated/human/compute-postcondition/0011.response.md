Postcondition: ***`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least 2 characters remaining. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s0` being 2, while `s1` remains 0. If `c` is '1', then `s1` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s1` being 1, while `s0` remains 1. This accounts for all cases where `c` is either '0' or '1'.***
