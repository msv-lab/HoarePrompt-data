The value of `s0` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `s0` is 1, so after execution, `s0` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`S`, `s1`, and `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least 2 characters remaining, `s0` is 2, `s1` is 0, `c` is the next character in `S`.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least 2 characters remaining, `s0` is 2, `s1` is 0, `c` is the next character in `S`**
