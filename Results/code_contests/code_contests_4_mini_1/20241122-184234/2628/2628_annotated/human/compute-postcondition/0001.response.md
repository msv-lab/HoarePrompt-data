The variables `s0` and `s1` are both assigned the value of `0`. The initial state of the variable `S` (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `s0` and `s1`, while `S` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1'; `s0` is 0, `s1` is 0**
