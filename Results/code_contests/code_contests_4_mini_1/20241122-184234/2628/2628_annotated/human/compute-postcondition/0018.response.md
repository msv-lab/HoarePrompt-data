The code prints the maximum value between `s0` and `s1`. The values of `s0` and `s1` are unchanged by the print statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `s0` and `s1` as they are.

Output State: **`s0` is the count of '0's in the string `S`, `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `S`, and the function prints max(`s0`, `s1`)**
