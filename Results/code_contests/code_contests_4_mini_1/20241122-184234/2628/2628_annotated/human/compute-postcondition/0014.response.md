The value of `s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` can be either 0 or 1, so after the execution, `s1` can be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables (`S`, `c`, `s0`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `c` is the next character in `S`, `s0` is either 2 or 3, and `s1` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `c` is the next character in `S`, `s0` is either 2 or 3, and `s1` is either 1 or 2**
