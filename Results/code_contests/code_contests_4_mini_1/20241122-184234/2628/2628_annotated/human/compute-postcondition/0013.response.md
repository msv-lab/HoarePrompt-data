The value of `s0` is incremented by 1, but since the previous value of `s0` is either 2 or 3, the new value of `s0` will be either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables `S`, `c`, and `s1` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least 1 character remaining, `c` is the next character in `S`, `s0` is either 3 or 4, and `s1` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last processed character.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least 1 character remaining, `c` is the next character in `S`, `s0` is either 3 or 4, and `s1` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last processed character.**
