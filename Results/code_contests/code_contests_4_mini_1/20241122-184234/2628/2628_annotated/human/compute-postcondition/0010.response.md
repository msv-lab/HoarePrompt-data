The value of `s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` is 0, so after execution, `s1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least 2 characters remaining, `s0` is 1, `s1` is 1, `c` is the next character in `S`.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least 2 characters remaining, `s0` is 1, `s1` is 1, `c` is the next character in `S`**
