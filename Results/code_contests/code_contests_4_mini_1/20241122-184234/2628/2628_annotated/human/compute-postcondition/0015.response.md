Postcondition: ***`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `c` is the next character in `S`. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is either 3 or 4 (depending on the last processed character), and `s1` remains either 0 or 1. If `c` is '1', then `s0` remains either 2 or 3, and `s1` is either 1 or 2 (depending on the last processed character).***
