Let's break down the problem description and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to draw a frame that has a height of H cm and a width of W cm. The frame should consist of `#` characters forming the borders and `.` characters filling the inner area. The constraints state that both H and W should be between 3 and 300, inclusive. 

### Provided Code
```python
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    for i in range(0, h):
        for j in range(0, w):
            if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or (j == w - 1):
                print('#')
            else:
                print('.')
        print
```

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads pairs of integers (H, W) until (0, 0) is encountered. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Frame Generation**: The nested loops iterate over the height and width to create the frame. However, the logic used in the inner loop has issues:
   - The condition to print `#` is incorrect. It checks if `i == 0` (top row), `j == 0` (left column), `i == h - 1` (bottom row), and `j == w - 1` (right column). However, the way the `print` function is called does not format it correctly into a single line.
   - Instead of printing `#` or `.` on the same line, it prints each character on a new line. Therefore, it will not create a proper rectangular frame, but rather a vertical output of characters.

3. **Blank Lines**: After each dataset, it prints a blank line, which is not explicitly handled in the code. The `print` statement at the end of the inner loop does not include parentheses, which in Python 2.x would print a blank line, but in Python 3.x would lead to a syntax error.

### Output Hints
The output hints indicate that the function should generate a rectangle with a border of `#` characters, but due to the flawed implementation, the output will not match this description correctly. It also mentions that the code does not handle cases where either `h` or `w` is less than 1, which aligns with the constraints given.

### Conclusion
The code does not correctly implement the logic required to produce the frame because:
- It does not print the characters on the same line, leading to incorrect output formatting.
- It does not handle the case of invalid dimensions properly (although the constraints ensure valid input).

Thus, it does not follow the problem description properly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
