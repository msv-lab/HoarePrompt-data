According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The `for` loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `w` is an integer in the range [3, 300]. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to 1. The value of `w` remains unchanged since it is still within the allowable range. 

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `j` is 1**
