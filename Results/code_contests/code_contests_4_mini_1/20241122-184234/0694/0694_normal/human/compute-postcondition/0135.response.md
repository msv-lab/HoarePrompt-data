According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which means the next value of `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. 

Currently, `w` is greater than 1. Therefore, if `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be adjusted to 2. 

We do not need to adjust `h` or `i` since they do not affect the loop's execution in this context. 

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
