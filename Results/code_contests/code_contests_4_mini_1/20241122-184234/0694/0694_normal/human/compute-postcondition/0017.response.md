The code executes a print statement which outputs a period ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not alter any variable states. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `j` is 1**
