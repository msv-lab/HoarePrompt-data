According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 3, and `w` must remain greater than 3 to ensure the loop continues.

So, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` should be 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since `i` and `h` do not affect the loop's execution directly in this context.

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3**
