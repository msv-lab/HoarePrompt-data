According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unchanged, and since the loop iterates from `0` to `h - 1`, `h` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `h` must be greater than `i`, which it currently is not explicitly stated. 

So, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `h` is greater than `i`. Since `i` remains unchanged, we can infer that `h` should be modified to be greater than the current value of `i`. 

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `i` is unchanged, `w` is unchanged**
