The code snippet contains a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged after this statement, as the print function does not alter any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the action of printing `#`.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is either 0 or `h - 1`, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
