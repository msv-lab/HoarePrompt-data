The `print('.')` statement outputs a period (dot) to the console. It does not modify any of the previous variable values. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, and a dot is printed**
