The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not altered by this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
