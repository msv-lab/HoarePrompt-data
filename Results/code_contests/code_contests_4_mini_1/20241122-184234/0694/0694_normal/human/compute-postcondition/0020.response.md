Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], and `j` will take values from 0 to `w - 1`. For each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, the character '.' is printed. If `w` is 0 or negative (which shouldn't occur based on the initial state), the loop does not execute and `j` remains undefined. However, given the initial state, the loop will always execute `w` times, with `j` ranging from 0 to `w - 1`.**
