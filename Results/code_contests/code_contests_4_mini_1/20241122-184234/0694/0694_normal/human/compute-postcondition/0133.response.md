The code executes a print statement, which outputs a dot ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and notes the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and a dot ('.') has been printed.**
