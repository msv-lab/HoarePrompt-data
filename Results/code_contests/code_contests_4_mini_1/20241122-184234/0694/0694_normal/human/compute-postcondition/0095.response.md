The code executes a print statement, which outputs a dot (.). However, it does not change any variable values. The initial state remains unchanged, so the output state is: `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [5, 300], `j` is equal to `w`, and a dot is printed.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [5, 300], `j` is equal to `w`, and a dot is printed.**
