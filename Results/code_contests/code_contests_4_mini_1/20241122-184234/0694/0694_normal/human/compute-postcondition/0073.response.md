The code executes a print statement that outputs a dot ('.'). The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the action of printing.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and a dot ('.') is printed.**
