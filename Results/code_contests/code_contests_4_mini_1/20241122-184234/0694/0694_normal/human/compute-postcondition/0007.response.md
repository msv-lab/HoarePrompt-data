The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as this statement does not affect their values. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed character.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `w` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and either `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and the character '#' is printed.**
