The code executes a print statement that outputs a period (`.`) to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and a period (.) is printed.**
