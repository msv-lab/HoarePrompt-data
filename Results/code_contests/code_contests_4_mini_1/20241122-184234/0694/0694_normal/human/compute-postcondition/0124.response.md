According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0, as the range for `i` is from 0 to `h-1`. The current state indicates that `h` is in the range [3, 300], which means it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. The value of `i` will start from 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the state can remain as is, but we need to specify the initial value of `i` when the loop starts. 

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0**
