The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, and the output is the character `#`.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, and the output is '#'**
