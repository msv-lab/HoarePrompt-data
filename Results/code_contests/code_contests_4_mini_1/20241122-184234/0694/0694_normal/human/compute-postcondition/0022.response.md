According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is in the range [3, 300], but we do not have the exact value for `i`. Since `i` is expected to start from 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration, it is essential to determine the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration to ensure that it can execute again.

If `i` is currently equal to `h - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `h`, which would cause the loop to terminate, as `i` would no longer be less than `h`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `h - 1` and `h` should be in the range [4, 300] (to ensure that `h` is still greater than 3).

State: **`h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is equal to `h - 1`**
