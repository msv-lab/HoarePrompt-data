The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. The previous values of `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [4, 300], `j` is `w`, and a dot is printed to the console.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [4, 300], `j` is `w`, and a dot is printed to the console.**
