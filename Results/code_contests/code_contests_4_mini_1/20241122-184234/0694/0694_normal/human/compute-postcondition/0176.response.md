Output State: **If `w` is at least 3, the loop executes `w` times, and during each iteration, `i` remains 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], and `j` varies from 0 to `w - 1`. If `i` equals 0, or `j` equals 0, or `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, the output will be '#'. Otherwise, the output will be '.' If `w` is less than 3, the loop will not execute, and `i` will remain 2, `h` will be in the range [3, 300], and `j` will not be assigned a value.**
