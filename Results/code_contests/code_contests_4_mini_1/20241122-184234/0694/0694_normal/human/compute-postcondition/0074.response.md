Postcondition: ***`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, a dot ('.') is printed. This covers all edge cases, ensuring that the output reflects the position of `i` and `j` relative to the boundaries defined by `h` and `w`.***
