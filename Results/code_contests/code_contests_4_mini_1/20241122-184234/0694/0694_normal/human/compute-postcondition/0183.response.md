Functionality: ** The function continuously processes pairs of integers (h, w) representing height and width. It generates a rectangle with a border of '#' characters and inner filled with '.' characters, based on the given dimensions. The function terminates input processing when the pair (0, 0) is encountered. However, the function does not handle cases where either h or w is less than 1, and it does not account for invalid input dimensions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. **
