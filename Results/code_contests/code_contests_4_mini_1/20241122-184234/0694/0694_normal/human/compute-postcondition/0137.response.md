The code uses the `print` function to output a dot (`.`) to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the `print` statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects that the dot is printed while the existing variable states remain the same.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and a dot (.) is printed**.
