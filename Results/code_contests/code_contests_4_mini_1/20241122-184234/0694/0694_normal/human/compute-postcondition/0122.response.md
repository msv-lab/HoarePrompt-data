The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is in the range [0, h-1], `j` is in the range [0, w-1], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
