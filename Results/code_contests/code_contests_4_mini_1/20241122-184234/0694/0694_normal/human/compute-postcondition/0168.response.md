The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 1, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 1, and the character `#` is printed.**
