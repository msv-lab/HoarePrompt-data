According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute again regardless of the condition of the variables. There are no states that need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed because it will execute indefinitely. 

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is in the range [0, h-1], `j` is in the range [0, w-1]**
