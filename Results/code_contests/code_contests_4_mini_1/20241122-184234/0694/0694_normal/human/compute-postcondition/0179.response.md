Output State: **After executing the loop, `i` will be in the range [0, h-1], `j` will be in the range [0, w-1] for each iteration of `i`. The output will consist of '#' printed for the border elements (when `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is h-1, or `j` is w-1) and '.' printed for the inner elements (when 1 ≤ `i` < h-1 and 1 ≤ `j` < w-1). If `h` or `w` is less than 3, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains 0, `h` is in the range [3, 300], and `w` is in the range [3, 300]. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the program breaks out before executing the loop.**
