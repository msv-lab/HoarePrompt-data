According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be at least 1 because it defines the range of `j`. Given that `h` is in the range [3, 300], it doesn't directly affect the loop execution. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which is not relevant to the execution of the loop but indicates the state of another variable. The variable `j` will start from 0 as well since the loop begins at 0.

For the loop to be executed, `w` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the adjusted state should include that `w` is greater than 0, and `j` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop execution.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
