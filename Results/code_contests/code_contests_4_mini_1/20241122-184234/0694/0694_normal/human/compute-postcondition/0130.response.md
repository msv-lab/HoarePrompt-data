Postcondition: ***`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, the program prints '.'.***
