Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will always execute continuously unless there is an external break condition that is not detailed here. Therefore, there is no need to modify the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`h` remains in the range [3, 300], `w` remains in the range [3, 300], and `i` takes values from 0 to `h - 1`.**
