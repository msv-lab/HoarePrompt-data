The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` are not modified by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding their values. The print statement does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
