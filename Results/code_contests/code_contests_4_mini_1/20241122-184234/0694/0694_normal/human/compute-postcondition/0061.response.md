The variables `h` and `w` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which takes a space-separated string of values and splits it into two integers. The initial state indicates that `h` can be any value between 3 and 300, and `w` can also be any value between 3 and 300. After executing the code, `h` and `w` will have specific values based on the input but remain within their respective ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects that `h` and `w` are now assigned specific integer values from the input.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer in the range [3, 300]; `w` is an input integer in the range [3, 300]**
