The code contains a print statement that outputs a string '#'. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 1; output is '#'**
