According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `h`. The loop will iterate `h` times, starting from 0 up to `h - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `h` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state specifies `h` is in the range [3, 300], it implies that `h` is already valid and greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the correct initialization for the loop.

State: **`h` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `w` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0**
