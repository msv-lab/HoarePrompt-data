According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `w` is in the range [3, 300]. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` should become 1. The condition for `j` being less than `w` (which is still in the range [3, 300]) will still hold true.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `h` and `w` are still within their respective ranges, and the conditions for the output will be evaluated during the loop execution.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
