According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `h` is greater than 0, as it defines the range of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `h` is in the range [3, 300]. Since `h` is at least 3, the loop has executed multiple times, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to reflect the next iteration. 

Specifically, if `h` is at least 3, `i` would be 3 at the start of the next iteration, and `h` is still in the range [3, 300]. The value of `j` does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains unassigned.

State: **`i` is 3, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `j` is not assigned a value**
