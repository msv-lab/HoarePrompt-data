Output State: **The loop prints '#' for j equal to 0, and for j equal to w - 1, since i is always 1 (not 0 or h - 1). For all other values of j (from 1 to w - 2), it prints '.'. After the loop executes w times, `i` remains 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` will equal w - 1 after the final iteration. If `w` is less than 3, the loop does not execute, and `i` is still 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], and `w` is less than 3.**
