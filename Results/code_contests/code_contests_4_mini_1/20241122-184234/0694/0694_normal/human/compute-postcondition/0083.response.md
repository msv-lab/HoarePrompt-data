According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is at least 1 since it iterates from `0` to `w - 1`. Given that `h` is in the range [3, 300] and `w` is also in the range [3, 300], we can conclude that `w` will always be greater than 0. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to `0` for the first iteration. The variable `i` does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the relevant states before the loop execution should indicate that `j` is `0`, and `w` is within its defined range.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
