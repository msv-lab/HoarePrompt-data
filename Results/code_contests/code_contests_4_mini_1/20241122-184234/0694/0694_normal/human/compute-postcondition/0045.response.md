The `print('.')` statement outputs a period (dot) to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `h`, `i`, `j`, or `w`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. 

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0, and `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`, and the output is a dot (.)**
