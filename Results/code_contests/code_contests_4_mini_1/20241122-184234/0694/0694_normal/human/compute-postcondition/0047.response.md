According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1, and the condition must still hold that `j` is less than `w`. 

Since `w` is greater than 0, for the next iteration, the state of `j` must be updated to reflect this increment. No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables (`h`, `i`, `w`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop for the next iteration.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 1, `w` is greater than 0**
