The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer in the range [3, 300]; `w` is an input integer in the range [3, 300] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer in the range [3, 300]; `w` is an input integer in the range [3, 300] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
