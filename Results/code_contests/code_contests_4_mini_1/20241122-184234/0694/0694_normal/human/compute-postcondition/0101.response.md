According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will only execute if `w` is greater than 0, as the range for `j` is from 0 to `w`. Currently, `w` is 0, which means the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, `w` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. The value of `i` does not affect the loop execution, but `j` should start at 0 if `w` is greater than 0.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
