According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its maximum value of `w - 1` (since the loop iterates from `0 to w - 1`), which means for the next iteration, `j` would be `w` and would not satisfy the loop condition (`j < w`).

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `w` must be increased to at least `w + 1`. Additionally, since `j` starts from `0`, and it will increment in the next iteration, we will need to adjust `j` to be `w` to match the new state.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [4, 300], `j` is `w`**
