The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. It does not change the values of any variables in the program. The values of `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and a dot is printed to the console.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and a dot is printed to the console.**
