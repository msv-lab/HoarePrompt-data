The code executes a print statement that outputs a dot (`.`) to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is equal to `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a dot (`.`) is printed.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is equal to `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a dot (`.`) is printed.**
