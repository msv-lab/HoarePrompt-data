According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`, which iterates from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. 

Additionally, we need to ensure that the range for `w` allows for this increment. Since `w` is in the range [3, 300], it is guaranteed that `w` is at least 3, which means the loop can execute again when `j` is incremented. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` needs to be changed to 2 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted, as both `h` and `w` are still within their specified ranges and do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `j` is 2**
