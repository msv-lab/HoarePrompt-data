According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `w`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `w` which is currently equal to `w`. 

However, since `j` is equal to `w` at the end of the last iteration, the loop will not execute again unless the upper limit of the range changes. Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to increase `w` to at least `w + 1` to ensure that `j` can take on a value that allows the loop to run.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [5, 300], `j` is equal to `w`**
