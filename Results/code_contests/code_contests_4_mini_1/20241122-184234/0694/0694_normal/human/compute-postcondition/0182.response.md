The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it seems to read input values internally. However, it processes two integers, `H` and `W`, which represent height and width, respectively. Both `H` and `W` are constrained such that they must be integers within the range 3 to 300. The function continuously processes input pairs of integers until it encounters the pair (0, 0), which signifies the termination of input. The function likely performs some operations based on the values of `H` and `W` before ending. However, the exact output of the function is not specified in the information provided. 

Functionality: **The function processes pairs of integers (H, W) where H and W are both integers in the range of 3 to 300, and it terminates input processing when the pair (0, 0) is encountered.**
