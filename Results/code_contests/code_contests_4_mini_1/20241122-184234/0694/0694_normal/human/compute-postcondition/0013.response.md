The code snippet executes a print statement which outputs a dot ('.'). The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of all variables along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `w` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `j` is equal to `w`, `i` remains the same, and the output is '.'**
