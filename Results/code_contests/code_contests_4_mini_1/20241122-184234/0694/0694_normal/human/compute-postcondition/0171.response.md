According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `w` is at least 3, the loop will still have room to execute again. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- `j` should be set to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `i`, `h`, and `w` do not change and do not affect the ability of the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 2**
