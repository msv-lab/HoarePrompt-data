According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0, since `range(0, w)` generates a sequence from 0 to w-1. Given that `w` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop will execute at least 3 times.

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `j` will take on values from 0 up to `w - 1`. Since `j` is initially set to `w - 1`, it needs to be adjusted to 0 for the loop to start executing. 

Thus, the state should reflect that `j` is now initialized to 0, and `w` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 0**
