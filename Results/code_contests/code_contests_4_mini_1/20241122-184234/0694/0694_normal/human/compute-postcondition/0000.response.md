The variables `h` and `w` are assigned values from the input, which is a pair of integers read from `raw_input()`. The values of `h` and `w` can be any integers within the range specified (3 to 300) except for the terminating input (0, 0). Since the specific input is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `h` and `w` but can state that they will be integers within the defined limits. Therefore, the output state reflects that `h` and `w` will hold the input integers while noting that the input process continues until (0, 0) is received.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `w` is an integer in the range [3, 300] until (0, 0) is received**
