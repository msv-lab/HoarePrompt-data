The code executes a print statement, which outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 0 and the output is '#'**
