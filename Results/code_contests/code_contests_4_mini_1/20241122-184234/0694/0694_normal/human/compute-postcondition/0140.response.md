Output State: **The loop executes `w` times, where `w` is in the range [3, 300]. During each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. If `w` is at least 1, the loop executes completely; if `w` is 0 or negative (though this should not happen given the initial state), the loop does not execute and `i` remains 0, `h` is in the range [3, 300], and `w` would be 0. In summary, after the loop execution, `i` is still 0, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` will be equal to `w - 1` after the last iteration.**
