According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is at least 1 since it iterates from `0` to `w-1`. Given that `w` is in the range [3, 300], it will always be at least 3. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `j` will begin at `0` (the initial value for the first iteration). The variable `i` does not affect the execution of the loop but is initialized to `0`. 

Therefore, the state needs to include that `j` is `0` at the beginning of the loop execution.

State: **`h` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `w` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
