Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is in the range [0, h-1], `j` is in the range [0, w-1]. The loop generates a pattern of '#' for the borders of a rectangle of height `h` and width `w`, and '.' for the inner area. If either `h` or `w` is less than 3, or if they are both 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated. In those cases, `h` remains unchanged and `w` remains unchanged.**
