According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `w` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Given that `w` is at least 3, it allows for this increment to occur, meaning the loop can execute again.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the state are to increment `j` to 3, while the other variables `i`, `h`, and `w` remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3**
