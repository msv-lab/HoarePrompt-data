The code snippet `print('#')` outputs the character `#` to the console. This action does not modify the values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the output to the console. The variable states are still intact.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and the character '#' is printed to the console**.
