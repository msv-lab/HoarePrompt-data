According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be at least 1. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment up to `w - 1`. Given that `h` is in the range [4, 300] and `w` is in the range [3, 300], we can conclude that `w` is at least 3, ensuring that the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 0, and since `i` is equal to `h - 1`, the value of `i` does not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `w` should be at least 1, `j` should start at 0, and `i` is equal to `h - 1`.

State: **`h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is equal to `h - 1`, `j` is 0**
