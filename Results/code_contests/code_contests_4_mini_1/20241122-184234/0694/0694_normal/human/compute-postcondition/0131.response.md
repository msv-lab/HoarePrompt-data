To determine the adjustments needed for the program state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `0` to `w`, which means it can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the state indicates that `j` is currently `0`.
3. Since `w` is greater than `0`, the loop can execute at least once. We need to consider how the value of `j` will change as the loop progresses.
4. After the first iteration (when `j` is `0`), the next value of `j` for the next iteration will be `1`.
5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` will be adjusted to `1` and that `w` is greater than `1` in order for the loop to continue executing.

Based on this reasoning, the adjustments needed to the state are:
- `j` will become `1` after the next iteration.
- Since `w` is currently only stated as greater than `0`, to ensure that the loop will execute again, we need to guarantee that `w` is greater than `1`.

Thus, the modified state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.**
