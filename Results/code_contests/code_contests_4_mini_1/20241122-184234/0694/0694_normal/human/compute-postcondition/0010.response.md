Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are integers in the range [3, 300]. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, the output is '.'***
