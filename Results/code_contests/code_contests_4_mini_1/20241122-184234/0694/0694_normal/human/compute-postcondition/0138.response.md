Postcondition: ***`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 (the top row), `j` is 0 (the left column), `i` is equal to `h - 1` (the bottom row), or `j` is equal to `w - 1` (the right column), the program prints '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is between 1 and `h - 2` (exclusive) and `j` is between 1 and `w - 2` (exclusive), a dot (.) is printed. All edge cases regarding the boundaries of `i` and `j` with respect to `h` and `w` are considered appropriately.***
