According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the variable `w`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` equal to 3 and `w` greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `w` must still be greater than 4, and `j` should be incremented to 4. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are that `j` is now 4, and `w` remains greater than or equal to 4, but it does not need to be adjusted because it already satisfies the condition.

State: **`h` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
