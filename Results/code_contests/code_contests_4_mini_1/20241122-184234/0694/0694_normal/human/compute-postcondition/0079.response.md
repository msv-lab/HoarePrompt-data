According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. Currently, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1, so it will become 3. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is in the range [3, 300], meaning it could be 3 or any value greater than that. To ensure the loop executes again, `w` must be greater than 3 since `j` is currently 2. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` should be 3 to represent the next index.
- `w` must be greater than 3 to allow `j` to be valid.

No other states need to be modified.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
