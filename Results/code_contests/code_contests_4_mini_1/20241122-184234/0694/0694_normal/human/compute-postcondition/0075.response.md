According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` in the range from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2. The variable `w` is in the range [3, 300], which means it is at least 3, and thus `j` can be incremented without going out of bounds.

Considering this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. The other variables `h`, `w`, and `i` do not need to be changed as they are not directly affected by the next iteration of this loop.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
