Output State: **`h` remains in the range [3, 300], `w` remains in the range [3, 300], and `i` takes values from 0 to `h - 1`. The loop will execute `h` times, and within each iteration of `i`, the loop for `j` will execute `w` times. The characters '#' are printed for the first and last row and column, while '.' is printed for the inner cells. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program will not execute the loops and will break out before running any code, leaving `h` and `w` unchanged. If `h` or `w` is less than 3, the program logic does not correctly handle these cases, as it assumes both will always be at least 3.**
