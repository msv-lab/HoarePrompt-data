The code prints a dot ('.'), which does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. The previous values of the affected variables are still valid.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and a dot ('.') is printed.**
