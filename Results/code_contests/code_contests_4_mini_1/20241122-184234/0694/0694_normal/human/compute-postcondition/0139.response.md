According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 1. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` should be 3. For the loop to execute, `w` must also be greater than 3, so that the range of `j` can include 3.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` changes from 2 to 3.
- `w` must be greater than 3.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
