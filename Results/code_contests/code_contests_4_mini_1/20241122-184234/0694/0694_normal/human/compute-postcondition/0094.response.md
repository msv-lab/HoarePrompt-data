The code executes a print statement that outputs `'#'`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variable values along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [5, 300], `j` is equal to `w`, and the output is '#'**
