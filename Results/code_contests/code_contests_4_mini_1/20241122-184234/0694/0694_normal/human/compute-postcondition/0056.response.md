Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, with `j` ranging from 0 to `w-1`. During each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, the character `#` is printed. Otherwise, a dot `.` is printed. If `w` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute, and no output will occur. The values of `h`, `i`, and `w` remain unchanged after the loop.**
