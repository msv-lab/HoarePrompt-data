According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. Since `h` does not affect the loop execution, we only need to focus on `w` and `i`. Given that `i` starts at 0 and `j` will take values starting from 0 up to `w-1`, we need to ensure that `w` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `w` must be greater than 0 (which it is, since `w` is in the range [3, 300]), and `i` remains at 0 as it is not modified within the loop before execution.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
