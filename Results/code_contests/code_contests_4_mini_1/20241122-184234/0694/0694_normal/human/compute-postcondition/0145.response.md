The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables are not changed by this operation, so the output state still reflects the initial values of the variables.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 0, and either `i` is equal to 0, or `j` is equal to 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1, and the function prints '#'**
