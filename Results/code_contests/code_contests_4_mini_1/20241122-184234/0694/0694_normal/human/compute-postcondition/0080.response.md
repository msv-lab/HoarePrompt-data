Output State: **After the loop executes `w` times, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], and `i` is 0. For every value of `j` from 0 to `w-1`, if `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output will be '#' for those iterations. If `w` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the values of `h`, `w`, and `i` will remain unchanged. If `w` is 0 or negative, no output will be generated.**
