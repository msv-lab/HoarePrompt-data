According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented to 1, and `j` should still be less than `w`.

Since there are no adjustments needed for `h` or `i` in this context, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1**
