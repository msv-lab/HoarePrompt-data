According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still 0, `h` is in the range [3, 300], and since `i` is 0, it is less than the lower bound of `h` (which is 3). Therefore, the loop can execute again.

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. After the last iteration, `i` is 0, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `h` remains within the range [3, 300], so no changes are needed for `h`, `w`, or `j`. 

State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is equal to `w - 1`**
