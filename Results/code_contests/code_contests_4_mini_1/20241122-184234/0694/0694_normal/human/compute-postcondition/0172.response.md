The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 2, and the console prints '#'**
