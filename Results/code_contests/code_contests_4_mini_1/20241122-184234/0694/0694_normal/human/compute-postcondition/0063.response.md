Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are input integers in the range [3, 300]. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There are no other conditions affecting the flow of the program, as `h` and `w` must be in the specified range and cannot be 0.***
