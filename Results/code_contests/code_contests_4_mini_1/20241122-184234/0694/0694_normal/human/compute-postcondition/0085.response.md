The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the print function does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
