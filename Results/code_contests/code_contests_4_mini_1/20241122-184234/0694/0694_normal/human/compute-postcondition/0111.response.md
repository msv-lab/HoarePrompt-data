According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` must be 1.

Since `w` is greater than 0, it allows for the next value of `j` (which would be 1) to be less than `w`, provided that `w` is greater than 1. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute again, `w` must be greater than 1.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
