According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, and we need to determine if `j` can be incremented to allow the loop to execute again.

Since `j` iterates from `0` to `w - 1`, if `j` is currently at `w - 1`, the loop will not execute again since there are no more values left in the range. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w - 1`. 

So, we need to adjust `j` to `w`, which would mean that `j` needs to be equal to `w` and `w` should remain in the range [3, 300].

State: **`h` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `w` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `j` is equal to `w`, and `i` remains the same.**
