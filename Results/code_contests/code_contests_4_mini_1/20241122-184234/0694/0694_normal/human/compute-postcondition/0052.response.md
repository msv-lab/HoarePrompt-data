The code executes a print statement which outputs the character `'#'`. The values of the variables `h`, `i`, `j`, and `w` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and the action taken by the print statement.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 1, `w` is greater than 1, and the character '#' is printed.**
