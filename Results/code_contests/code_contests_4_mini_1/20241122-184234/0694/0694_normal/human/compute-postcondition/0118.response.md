According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `h`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `h` is in the range [3, 300]. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be greater than 2. Since `h` is already in the range [3, 300], this condition is satisfied. 

However, we also need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. The loop increments `i` at each iteration, so after the last iteration where `i` is 2, `i` should be adjusted to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`w` is 0, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 3, `j` is undefined**
