According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1, and since `w` is still greater than or equal to 3, it will allow the loop to proceed.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the conditions related to `i`, `h`, and `w` will still hold true.

State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 1**
