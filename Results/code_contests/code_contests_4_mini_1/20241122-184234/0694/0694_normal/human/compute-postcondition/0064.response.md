According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `h`. The loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0, as the range for the loop is from 0 to `h`. Since `h` and `w` are stated to be input integers in the range [3, 300], we can conclude that `h` is at least 3. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take values starting from 0 and will increment until it reaches `h - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0**
