According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `h`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `h` is in the range [3, 300], meaning `h` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `h` does not need to be adjusted since it remains in the range [3, 300], which is sufficient for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 1, and no output is generated.**
