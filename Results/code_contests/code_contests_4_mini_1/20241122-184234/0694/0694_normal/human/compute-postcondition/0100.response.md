According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and the loop index `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is 0, and `i` is 1.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. Since `h` is still in the range [3, 300], it guarantees that `i` (now 2) is still less than `h`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect the updated value of `i` while keeping `h` in the same range.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is 0, `i` is 2**
