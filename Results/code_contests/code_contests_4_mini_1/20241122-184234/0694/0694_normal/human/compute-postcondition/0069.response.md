The code snippet `print('.')` outputs a dot to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state is unchanged in terms of variable values. 

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`.**
