Output State: **After the loop executes `w` times, if `i` is in the range [4, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], and `j` is in the range [0, w-1], the output will be '#' if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. If none of these conditions are met, the output will be '.' for each `j` from 1 to `w-2`. If `w` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and no output will be generated. If `w` is only 1, the output will be '#' for `j = 0`. If `w` is 2, the outputs will be '#' for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.**
