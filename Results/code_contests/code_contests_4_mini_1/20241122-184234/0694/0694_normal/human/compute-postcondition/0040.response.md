According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `h` and the value of `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. Since the loop has not generated any output, we need to infer the state of `i` and `h`.

At the end of the last iteration, no output was generated, which means that the loop has either just completed its last iteration or the loop body did not produce output. If `i` reached `h - 1` in the last iteration, it will not execute again since `i` would equal `h` in the next iteration, failing the loop condition.

For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be greater than `i`. Without any specific value given for `i`, we can only state that `h` must be at least `i + 1`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `h` must be greater than `i` to allow for another iteration.
- If we assume that `i` was at its maximum value (i = h - 1), then we can state that `h` needs to be at least `i + 1`.

Given that no specific values for `i` or `h` were provided, we can conclude:

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `h`**
