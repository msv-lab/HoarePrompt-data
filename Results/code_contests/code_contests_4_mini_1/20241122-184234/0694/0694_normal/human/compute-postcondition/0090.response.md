The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` are not modified by this statement, so their ranges and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [4, 300], `j` is `w`, and the output is '#'**
