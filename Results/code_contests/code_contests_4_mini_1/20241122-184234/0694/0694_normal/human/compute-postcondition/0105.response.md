The code snippet contains a `print` statement which outputs a dot (`.`) to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values, but the action of printing occurs. 

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and `i` is less than `h - 1`, and a dot (.) is printed to the console.**
