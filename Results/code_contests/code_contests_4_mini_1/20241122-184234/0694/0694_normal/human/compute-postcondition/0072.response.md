The code prints the character `#`, which does not affect the values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables while noting the action taken.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the character '#' is printed.**
