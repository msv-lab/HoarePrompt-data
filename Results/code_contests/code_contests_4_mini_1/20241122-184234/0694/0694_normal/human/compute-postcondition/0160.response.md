According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `h`. The loop will continue to run as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains 1, and `h` is in the range [3, 300]. 

Since `h` is at least 3, and `i` is 1, `i` is less than `h`. Therefore, the loop can execute again. After the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1. 

To reflect the state at the beginning of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be 2. The value of `h` does not need to be adjusted, as it remains in the range [3, 300].

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` equals w - 1**
