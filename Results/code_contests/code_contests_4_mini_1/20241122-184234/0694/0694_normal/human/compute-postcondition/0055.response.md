According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `w` is greater than 1, which means that the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will increment by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2. The other states (`h`, `i`, `w`) do not need to be adjusted, as they do not affect the condition for the loop's next execution.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 1**
