The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state is unchanged in terms of variable values, but we note that the `#` character has been printed.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and the character '#' has been printed.**
