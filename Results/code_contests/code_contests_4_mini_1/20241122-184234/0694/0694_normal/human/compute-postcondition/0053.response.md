The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot (.) to the console. It does not modify the values of any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same, with the addition of the printed character.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 1, `w` is greater than 1, and a dot (.) is printed to the console.**
