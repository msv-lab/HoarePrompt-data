Postcondition: ***`h` is in the range [3, 300] and `w` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is within the range (0, h - 1) and `j` is within the range (0, w - 1), then a dot ('.') is printed.***
