Output State: **If `w` is at least 1, the loop executes `w` times. For each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is 1 and `j` is between 1 and `w - 2`, the output is '.'. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute and no output is generated, leaving `h` in the range [3, 300], `w` as 0, and `i` as 1.**
