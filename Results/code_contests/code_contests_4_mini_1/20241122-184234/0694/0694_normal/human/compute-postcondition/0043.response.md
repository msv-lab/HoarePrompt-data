The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `i`, `j`, and `w` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0, and the character `#` is printed.**
