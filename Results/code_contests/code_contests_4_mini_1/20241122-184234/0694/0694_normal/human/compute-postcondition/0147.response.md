The code executes a `print` statement that outputs a period (`.`) to the console. This action does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the variable values.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to h - 1, and `j` is not equal to w - 1, and the output is a period (.).**
