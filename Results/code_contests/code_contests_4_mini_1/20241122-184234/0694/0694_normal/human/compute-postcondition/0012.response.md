The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the action taken by the print statement.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `w` is an integer in the range [3, 300], `j` is equal to `w`, `i` remains the same, and the character `#` is printed.**
