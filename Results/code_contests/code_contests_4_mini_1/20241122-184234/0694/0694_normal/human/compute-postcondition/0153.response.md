According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` is currently 1, it can increment to 2 for the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted because `h` and `i` do not affect the continuation of the loop in this context.

State: **`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 2**
