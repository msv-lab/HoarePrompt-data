Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 0. If `i` is equal to 0, or `j` is equal to 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the function prints '#'. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, the function prints a period ('.').***
