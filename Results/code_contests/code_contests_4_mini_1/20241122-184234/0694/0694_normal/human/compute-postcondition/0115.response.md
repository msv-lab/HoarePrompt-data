According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `w` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `w` must remain greater than 2 to ensure that the loop can continue.

State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
