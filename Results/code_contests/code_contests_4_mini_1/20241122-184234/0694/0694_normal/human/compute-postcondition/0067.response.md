The code executes a print statement, which outputs the character `'#'`. The variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not modified by this statement. Therefore, the output state includes the existing values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j`, along with the printed character.

Output State: **`h` is in the range [3, 300], `w` is in the range [3, 300], `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
