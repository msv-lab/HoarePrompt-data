According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, which means it has incremented from its previous value. Since `h` is greater than `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which is now `i + 1`. 

Given that `h` is greater than `i + 1`, it needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than `i + 2` for the loop to execute again. Additionally, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1` in the next iteration, so it should be updated accordingly. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be updated to `i + 1` (which is the value it will take in the next iteration).
- `h` should remain greater than `i + 2` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is the current iteration index (from 0 to `w-1`)**
