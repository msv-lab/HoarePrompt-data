The code executes a print statement that outputs a dot ('.'). The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged because the print statement does not affect their values. Therefore, the output state describes the current values of the variables and notes that a dot has been printed.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; and it is false that `i` equals 0, `j` equals 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, and `j` equals `w - 1; a dot (.) has been printed.**
