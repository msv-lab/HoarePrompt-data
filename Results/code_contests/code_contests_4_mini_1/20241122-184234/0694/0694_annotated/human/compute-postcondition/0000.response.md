The values of `h` and `w` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state specifies that `H` and `W` are integers within the range of 3 to 300, and the input will continue until the pair (0, 0) is encountered. Therefore, after executing the line of code, `h` and `w` will hold the values of the integers read from the input. The output state will reflect the values of `h` and `w` as they are read in.

Output State: **`h` is an integer from input, `w` is an integer from input**
