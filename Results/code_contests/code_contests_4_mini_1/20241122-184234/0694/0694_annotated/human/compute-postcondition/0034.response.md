The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the character `#` but does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `w` is greater than 2, and the output is `#`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `w` is greater than 2, and the output is `#`**
