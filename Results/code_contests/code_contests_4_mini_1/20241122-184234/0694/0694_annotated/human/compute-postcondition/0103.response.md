The code `print('#')` outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not modify any of the variable states, so the values of `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. 

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
