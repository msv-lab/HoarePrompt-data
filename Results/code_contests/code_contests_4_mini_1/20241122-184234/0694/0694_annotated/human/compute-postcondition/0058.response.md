According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 0 to `h-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `h` is at least 2. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be at least 3 (to allow `i` to take the value 2), and `i` should be incremented to 3 for the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`h` is at least 3, `i` is 3**
