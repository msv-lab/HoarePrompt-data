According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. Additionally, since `j` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, we need to ensure that `w` remains greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state so that `j` is now 1 and `w` must be greater than 1.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
