Since the snippet provided is incomplete and merely contains `print`, there is no specific output generated from this code. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and since `print` does not have any arguments provided, it will not output anything. 

The initial state indicates that `w` is greater than 0, meaning the loop would execute with the conditions outlined, but since there is no actual output to print in this scenario, the output state reflects the unchanged state of the variables.

Output State: **`i` remains `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is 0, and no output is generated.**
