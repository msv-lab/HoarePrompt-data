The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot (.) to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the print function does not modify them. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and a dot (.) is printed to the console.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and a dot (.) is printed to the console**
