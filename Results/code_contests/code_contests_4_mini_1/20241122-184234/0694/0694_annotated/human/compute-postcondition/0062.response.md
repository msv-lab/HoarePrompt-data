The value of the variables `h` and `w` do not change but we break out of the loop of the rectangle printing logic we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` and `w` are assigned input integer values; if both `h` and `w` are greater than 0, a rectangle of '#' and '.' characters was intended to be printed, but we break out of the most internal loop.
