According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. The current state indicates that `j` is 1, and we need to determine if the loop can execute one more time. 

Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than `w`. Given that `w` is greater than 0, we can conclude that to execute the loop one more time, `j` should be adjusted to 2, assuming `w` is at least 3. 

Since the current state does not provide specific information about `w` beyond it being greater than 0, we must adjust it to ensure `j` can take the next value in the range. 

Thus, the states need to be modified as follows: 
- `j` should be adjusted to 2 to prepare for the next iteration of the loop.
- Since `w` is greater than 0 but we need to ensure the loop can run, we can state that `w` must be greater than 2.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
