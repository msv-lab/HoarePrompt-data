Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, or `j` is equal to 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is less than `w - 1`, then '.' is printed. The output will either be '#' or '.' based on the conditions specified.***
