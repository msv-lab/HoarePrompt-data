According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 2 to allow for another iteration. 

Thus, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `j` needs to be updated to 2.
- Since `w` is greater than 0, we cannot make any assumptions about its value, but for the loop to execute at least one more time, we need `w` to be greater than 2.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
