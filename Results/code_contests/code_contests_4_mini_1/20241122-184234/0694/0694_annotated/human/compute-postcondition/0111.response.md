According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, it depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. Specifically, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `w`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `w` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 2.

Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `j` should be set to 2.
- `w` must be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
