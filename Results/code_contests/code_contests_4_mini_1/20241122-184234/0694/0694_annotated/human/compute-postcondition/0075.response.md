According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and both `h` and `w` are greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 2, and since there are no constraints on `h` and `w` other than being greater than 0, they remain unchanged.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2**
