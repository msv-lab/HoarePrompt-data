According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is at least 1. Since `j` is 0, which is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 1. The state of `h` and `w` does not need to change because they do not affect the conditions for the loop to execute again.

State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `w` is at least 1**
