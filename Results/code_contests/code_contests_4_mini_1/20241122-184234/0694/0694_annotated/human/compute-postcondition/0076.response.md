The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the character `#` has been printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the character `#` has been printed**.
