The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged and are not directly affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that `#` has been printed, along with the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1, and '#' has been printed.**
