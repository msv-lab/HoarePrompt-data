The code executes a print statement that outputs a period (`.`). The variables `h`, `i`, `j`, and `w` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any modification, along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `w` is at least 1, and the output is '.'**
