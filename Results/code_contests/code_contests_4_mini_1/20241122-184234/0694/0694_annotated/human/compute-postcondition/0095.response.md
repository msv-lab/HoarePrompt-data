The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console, but does not change the values of any variables. The initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2, and a dot is printed to the console.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and a dot is printed to the console.**
