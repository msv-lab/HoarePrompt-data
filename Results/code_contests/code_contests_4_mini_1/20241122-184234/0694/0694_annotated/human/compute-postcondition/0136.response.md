The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the previous values of the variables along with the action taken.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and it prints '#'**
