According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop will increment `j` by 1 in the next iteration, `j` will become 1. Thus, we need to adjust the state for `j` to reflect this increment.

No other states need to be adjusted as `h` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `w` is still greater than 0.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `w` is greater than 0**
