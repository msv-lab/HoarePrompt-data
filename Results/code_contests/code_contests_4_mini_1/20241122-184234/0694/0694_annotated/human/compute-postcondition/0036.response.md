Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 2. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is `#`. Otherwise, the output is `.`. This includes the cases where `i` and `j` are on the borders defined by `h` and `w`, respectively, as well as the standard case where both `i` and `j` are within the interior of the defined dimensions, resulting in a dot being printed.***
