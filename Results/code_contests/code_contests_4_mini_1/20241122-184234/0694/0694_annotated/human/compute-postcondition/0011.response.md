According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `w`. The loop variable `j` is currently at 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop runs from 0 to `w - 1`, `j` must be less than `w` to allow another iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, which means it is on the left boundary. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be incremented to 1. There is no need to adjust `h`, `w`, or `i` as they do not change during the loop execution.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
