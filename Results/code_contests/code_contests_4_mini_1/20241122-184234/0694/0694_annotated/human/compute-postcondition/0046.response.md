Postcondition: ***`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `w` is at least 1. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is less than `w - 1`, then a dot (.) is printed.***
