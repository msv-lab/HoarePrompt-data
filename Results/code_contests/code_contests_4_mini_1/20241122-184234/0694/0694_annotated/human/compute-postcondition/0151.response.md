The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console, but it does not affect the values of any variables. The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` retain their initial states. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and a dot is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and a dot is printed.**
