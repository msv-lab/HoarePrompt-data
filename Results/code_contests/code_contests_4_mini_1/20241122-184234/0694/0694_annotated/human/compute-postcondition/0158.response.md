Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times and `j` takes values from 0 to `w-1`. If `i` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is 0 or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, the output is '.'. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `h` remains greater than 1, `w` is 0 or lower, and no output is generated.**
