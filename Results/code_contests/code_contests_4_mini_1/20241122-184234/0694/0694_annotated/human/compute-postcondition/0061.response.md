Output State: **`h` and `w` are assigned input integer values; if both `h` and `w` are greater than 0, a rectangle of '#' and '.' characters will be printed. If `h` is 0, no output occurs and `i` is not defined. If `w` is 0, the inner loop does not execute, resulting in no printed output for each value of `i`.**
