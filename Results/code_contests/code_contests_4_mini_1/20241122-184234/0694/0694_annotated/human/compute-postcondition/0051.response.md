According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `j` equal to 2. 

Since `j` is currently 1 and `w` is at least 1, for the next iteration, `j` should be 2. The only adjustment needed is to increase `j` by 1.

State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `w` is at least 1**
