The values of the variables `h` and `w` do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
