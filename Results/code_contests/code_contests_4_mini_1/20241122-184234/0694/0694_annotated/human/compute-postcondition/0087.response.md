The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` are not modified by this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1**
