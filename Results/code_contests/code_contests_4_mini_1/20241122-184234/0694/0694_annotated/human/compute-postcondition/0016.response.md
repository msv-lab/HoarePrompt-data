The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not change the values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged apart from the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the output is '#'**
