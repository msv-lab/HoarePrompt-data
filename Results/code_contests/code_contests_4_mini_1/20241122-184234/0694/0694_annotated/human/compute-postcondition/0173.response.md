The `print('.')` statement outputs a period (.) to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. The values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and a period is printed to the console.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and a period is printed to the console.**
