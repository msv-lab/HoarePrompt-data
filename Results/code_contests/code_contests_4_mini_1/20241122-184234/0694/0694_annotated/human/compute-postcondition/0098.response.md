Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is the current iteration index (from 0 to w-1). The loop prints a character depending on the values of `i`, `j`, `h`, and `w`: it prints `#` if `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, otherwise it prints `.`. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `j` does not change, meaning no output is generated. In this case, `i` remains `i + 1`, and `h` is still greater than `i + 1`.**
