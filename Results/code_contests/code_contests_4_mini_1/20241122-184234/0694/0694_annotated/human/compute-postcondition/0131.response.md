According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at the maximum value of the previous iteration (which would be `w - 1` if the loop executed fully). Since the loop iterates from `0` to `w - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be reset to `0` and `w` must still be greater than `0`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be reset to 0.
- `w` remains greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
