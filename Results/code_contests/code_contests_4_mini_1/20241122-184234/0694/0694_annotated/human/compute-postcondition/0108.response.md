The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the string `#` to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the output `#` is printed.**
