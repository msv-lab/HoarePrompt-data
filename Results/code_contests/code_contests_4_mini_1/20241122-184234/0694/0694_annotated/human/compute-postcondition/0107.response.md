According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be incremented to 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to 1. The states for `i` and `h` do not need to be changed since they are not directly affected by the execution of the loop.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
