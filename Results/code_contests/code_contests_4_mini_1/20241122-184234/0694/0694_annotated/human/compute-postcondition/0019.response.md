According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. The variable `j` starts at 2, and the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w` (exclusive). Since `w` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment to the next value, which means it will become 3. However, since `j` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `w`, which is already satisfied if `w` is greater than 2. 

Therefore, we can adjust `j` to be 3, and since we do not have any other constraints on `h` or `w`, those do not need to be modified.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
