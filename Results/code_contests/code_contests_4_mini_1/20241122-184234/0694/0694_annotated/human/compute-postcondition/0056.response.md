Output State: **After the loop executes `w` times, `h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `j` ranges from 0 to `w-1`. If `w` is at least 1, then the loop will execute `w` times. In each iteration, if `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, a dot (.) is printed if none of these conditions are met. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged (i.e., `h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `j` does not exist as the loop does not run).**
