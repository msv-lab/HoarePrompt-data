According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1. Since `w` is greater than 0, it remains valid for the loop execution.

No other states need to be adjusted because the other variables (`i` and `h`) do not impact the loop's ability to execute again in this context. 

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
