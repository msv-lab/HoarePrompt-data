Output State: **If both `h` and `w` are greater than 0, the loop executes `h` times and prints the perimeter of a rectangle with '#' characters, and the interior with '.' characters. If `h` is 0 or `w` is 0, the loop does not execute and no output is produced. If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is 0, the outer loop executes `h` times but the inner loop does not execute, resulting in no output. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the program breaks out before producing any output. Thus, `i` is less than `h` when the loop executes, and `j` is less than `w` when the inner loop executes.**
