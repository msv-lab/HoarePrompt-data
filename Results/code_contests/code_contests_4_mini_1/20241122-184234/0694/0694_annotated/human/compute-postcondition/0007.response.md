The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged and are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
