The code snippet `print('#')` outputs the character `#` to the console. The variables `h`, `i`, `j`, and `w` are not affected by this print statement, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `w` is at least 1, and the character '#' is printed to the console.**
