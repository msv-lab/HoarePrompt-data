According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `h`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `h` is greater than 0, we can infer that `h` is at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, to allow for another iteration, `h` needs to be at least 2, and `i` should be updated to 2, as it increments on each iteration of the loop.

State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is in the range from 0 to `w-1`, and `w` is at least 1**
