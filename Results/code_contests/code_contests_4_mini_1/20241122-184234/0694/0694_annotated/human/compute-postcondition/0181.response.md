Output State: **If both `h` and `w` are at least 3, the loop will execute and print a rectangle of '#' characters for the perimeter and '.' characters for the interior. After the loop finishes, `h` and `w` retain their initial values. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the program will not execute the loop and will break immediately. If `h` is at least 3 and `w` is less than 3, the outer loop will execute `h` times but no interior characters will be printed, leading to incomplete rectangle printing without any errors. If `h` is less than 3, the outer loop will not execute, and the values of `h` and `w` will remain unchanged.**
