According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `h` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `j` remains undefined as it is not used in the loop.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is not defined**
