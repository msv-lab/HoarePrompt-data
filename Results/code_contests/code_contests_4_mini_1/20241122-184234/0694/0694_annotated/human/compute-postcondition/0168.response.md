The `print('#')` statement outputs a hash symbol `#` to the console. The variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the output is `#`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the output is `#`**
