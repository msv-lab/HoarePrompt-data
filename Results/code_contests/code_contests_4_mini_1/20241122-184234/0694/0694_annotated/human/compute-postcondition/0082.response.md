According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. Since the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we need to assume the states regarding `i` and `h`. 

To determine the states that need to be adjusted, we consider that if the loop has executed up to this point, `i` must have taken on values starting from 0 up to some number less than `h`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to the next value.

Assuming the last value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `i` (which must be less than `h`), then for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`. Also, `h` must remain greater than `i + 1` to allow one more execution.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now one greater than its last value, and `h` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is i + 1, `h` is greater than i + 1**
