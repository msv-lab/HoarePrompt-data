Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, printing '#' for `j` equal to 0 or `j` equal to `w - 1`, and for `i` equal to 0 (the top boundary); otherwise, it will print '.' for interior values. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `h` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, and `j` is not defined.**
