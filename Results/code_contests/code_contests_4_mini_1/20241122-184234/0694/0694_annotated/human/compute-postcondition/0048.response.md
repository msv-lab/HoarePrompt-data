The `print('#')` statement outputs the string `'#'` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `i`, `j`, and `w` remain unchanged since the print statement does not alter any variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the action of printing.

Output State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `w` is at least 1, and the output is '#'**
