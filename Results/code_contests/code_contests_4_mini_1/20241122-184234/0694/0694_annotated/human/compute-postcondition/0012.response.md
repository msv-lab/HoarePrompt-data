The code `print('#')` outputs the character `#` to the console. The execution of this code does not affect the values of any of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables. 

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the character '#' is printed.**
