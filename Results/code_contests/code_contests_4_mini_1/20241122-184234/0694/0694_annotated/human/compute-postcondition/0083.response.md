According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute at least once, `w` must be at least 1. The current state indicates that `i` is `i + 1`, which means it is not a specific number without knowing the initial value of `i`. The variable `h` is greater than `i + 1`, but this does not impact the execution of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `w` is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is i + 1, `h` is greater than i + 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
