Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is in the range from 0 to `w-1`, and `w` is at least 1. If `j` is equal to 0 or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, or if `i` is equal to 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, then '.' is printed. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and `j` will remain undefined. In this case, no output will be produced.**
