Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, and `j` will take on values from 0 to `w-1`. For each value of `j`, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is between 1 and `h - 2` and `j` is between 1 and `w - 2`, it prints '.'. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `j` is undefined. In that case, no output is produced.**
