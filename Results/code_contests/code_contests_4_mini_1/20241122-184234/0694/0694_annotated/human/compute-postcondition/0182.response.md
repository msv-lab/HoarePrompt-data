The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly from the function signature. Instead, it processes multiple datasets of integers `H` and `W` within defined constraints (3 ≤ H ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ W ≤ 300) until it encounters the pair (0, 0), which signifies the end of input. 

The function produces outputs based on the provided datasets of `H` and `W`. However, the specific nature of these outputs is not described in the prompt. Given the constraints, the function likely performs some computations or evaluations based on each valid pair of `H` and `W` before terminating on the (0, 0) input.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of integers H and W, where H and W are within the range of 3 to 300, and continues until it encounters the pair (0, 0), which indicates the end of input.**
