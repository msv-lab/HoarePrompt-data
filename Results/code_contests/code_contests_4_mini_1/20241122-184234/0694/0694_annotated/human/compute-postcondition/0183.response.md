Functionality: ** The function accepts pairs of integers `h` (height) and `w` (width) from user input, and continuously prints rectangles made of '#' characters for the perimeter and '.' characters for the interior until the input pair (0, 0) is encountered, which signals the termination of input. The function does not handle cases where `h` or `w` are less than 3, leading to incomplete rectangle printing or no output for such dimensions. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the function exits without printing anything. **
