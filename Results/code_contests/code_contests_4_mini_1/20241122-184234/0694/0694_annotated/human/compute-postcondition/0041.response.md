According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `w`. Since `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute, iterating from 0 to `w-1`. The variable `j` should start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. The values of `h` and `i` do not affect the execution of this loop directly, so they can remain unchanged. 

Thus, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to set `j` to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `w` is at least 1**
