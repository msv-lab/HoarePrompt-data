According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3.

Since `j` is currently 2 and must be less than `w` (which is greater than 2) for the loop to continue, we only need to adjust `j` to be 3. The values of `h`, `i`, and `w` do not need to be adjusted since they do not directly affect the continuation of the loop.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `w` is greater than 2**
