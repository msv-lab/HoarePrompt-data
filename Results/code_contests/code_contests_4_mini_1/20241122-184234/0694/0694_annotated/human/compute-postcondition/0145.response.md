The code executes a print statement that outputs the character '#'. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `j`, and `i` are not changed by this operation, but the output is generated. Therefore, the output state reflects the status of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is either 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1; printed output is '#'**
