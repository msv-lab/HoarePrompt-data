According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. If `h` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `h` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should also be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is input integer, `i` is 0**
