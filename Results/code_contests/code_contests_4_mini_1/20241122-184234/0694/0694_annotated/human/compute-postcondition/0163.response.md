The code uses the `print` function to output the string `'#'`. The variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation, and their states remain unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables alongside the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
