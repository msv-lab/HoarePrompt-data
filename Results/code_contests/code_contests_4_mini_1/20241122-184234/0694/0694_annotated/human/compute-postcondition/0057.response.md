The provided code snippet `print` does not include any arguments to print, which means nothing will be printed or displayed. The values of the variables remain unchanged since no loop runs and no output occurs. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `j` does not exist as the loop does not run.

Output State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `j` does not exist as the loop does not run**
