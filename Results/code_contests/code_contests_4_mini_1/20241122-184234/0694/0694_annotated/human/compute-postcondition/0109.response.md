The `print('.')` statement outputs a period ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the variable values, but we note that a period has been printed.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and a period has been printed**.
