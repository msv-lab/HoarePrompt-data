Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times with `h` remaining greater than 1, `i` equal to 1, and `j` ranging from 0 to `w - 1`. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `h` remains greater than 1, `w` is 0 or lower, and `i` is equal to 1. The `print` statement does not produce any output.**
