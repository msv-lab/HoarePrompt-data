Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, printing `'#'` for `j = 0` (if `i` is 0), and for any `j` at the boundaries (`j == 0` or `j == w - 1`) or when `i` is at the top or bottom of the range (`i == 0` or `i == h - 1`). If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed. Hence, if `w` is 0, no output is generated.**
