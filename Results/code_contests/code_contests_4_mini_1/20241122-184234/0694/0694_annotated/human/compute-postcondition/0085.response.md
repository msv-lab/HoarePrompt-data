The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `i` is either 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `i` is either 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1, and the character `#` is printed.**
