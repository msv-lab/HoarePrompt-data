According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making it 2, and `w` must be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration. 

Since `w` is currently greater than 0, we do not have enough information to adjust `w` specifically, but it must still be greater than `j`. Therefore, we can state that `w` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `w` is greater than 2**
