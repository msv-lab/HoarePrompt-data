Output State: **If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0, the loop will print a rectangle of '#' and '.' characters, where `i` will take values from 0 to `h-1` and `j` will take values from 0 to `w-1`. If `h` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `i` is not defined. If `w` is 0, the inner loop does not execute, resulting in only the outer loop running for each value of `i`, but nothing is printed. In such cases, `h` is at least 0, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` remains undefined.**
