According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, which means there is potential for at least one more iteration. However, the loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration. If the last iteration occurred when `i` was equal to `h - 1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `h`, and `h` can remain the same as it is still greater than 1.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is 0 or lower, `i` is equal to 1**
