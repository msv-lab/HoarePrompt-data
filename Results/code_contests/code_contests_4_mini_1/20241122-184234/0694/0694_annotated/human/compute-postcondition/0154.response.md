The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not modify any of the variable values `h`, `w`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that `#` has been printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `#` has been printed**
