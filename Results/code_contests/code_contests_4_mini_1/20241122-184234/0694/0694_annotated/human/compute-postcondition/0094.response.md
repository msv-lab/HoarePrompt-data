The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not change the values of any existing variables. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2, and the function outputs `#`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the function outputs `#`**
