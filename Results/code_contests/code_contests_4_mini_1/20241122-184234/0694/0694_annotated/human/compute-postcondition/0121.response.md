The code assigns values to `h` and `w` based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is then split and converted to integers. The initial state describes the conditions under which the loop would execute or not execute based on the values of `h` and `w`. Since the condition for execution depends on the values inputted, and those are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine specific values for `h` and `w`. The output state is dependent on the fact that `h` and `w` are now integers, but their specific values remain unknown.

Output State: **`h` and `w` are assigned input integer values**
