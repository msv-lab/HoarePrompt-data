The code executes a print statement that outputs a single dot ('.'). The previous values of the affected variables do not change, as the print function does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without alteration.

Output State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `w` is at least 1, and `j` is less than `w - 1`, and a dot (.) is printed**.
