Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `i` is at the top or bottom boundary (0 or `h - 1`) or `j` is at the left or right boundary (0 or `w - 1`), the output is '#'. Otherwise, if `i` and `j` are both within the interior boundaries (greater than 0 and less than `h - 1` and `w - 1`, respectively), the output is '.'.***
