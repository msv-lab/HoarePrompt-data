The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `i`, `j`, and `w` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `w` is greater than 2, and a dot is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `w` is greater than 2, and a dot is printed.**
