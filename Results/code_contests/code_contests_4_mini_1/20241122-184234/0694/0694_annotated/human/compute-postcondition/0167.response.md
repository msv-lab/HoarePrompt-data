According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. In the current state, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop can execute at least once more. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `h` is greater than 1
- `w` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` to 1, and the state of `h`, `w`, and `i` does not change. Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `j` has been incremented by 1.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
