According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1, and `w` remains greater than 0.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
