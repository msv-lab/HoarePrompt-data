Output State: **After executing the loop `w` times, `i` remains `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 2`, and `w` is greater than 0. The value of `j` will range from 0 to `w - 1`. The output will be '#' if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, otherwise a dot (.) will be printed. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `i` as `i + 1`, `h` greater than `i + 2`, and `w` equal to 0, with no output generated.**
