The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the character `#` is printed**.
