According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the program does not encounter a break or an exit condition. Since there are no exit conditions specified in the provided context, the loop can continue executing indefinitely without needing any adjustments to the states `h` and `w`, which remain unchanged throughout the execution.

State: **If both `h` and `w` are greater than 0, the loop executes `h` times, and for each iteration of `i`, it executes `w` times. The output will consist of `#` for the first and last rows (i=0 and i=h-1) and the first and last columns (j=0 and j=w-1), while the inner area will be `.`. If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is 0, the loop executes `h` times but generates no output. If `h` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated. The values of `h` and `w` remain unchanged throughout the execution.**
