According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute at least once, `w` must be greater than 0, since `range(0, w)` generates an empty range when `w` is 0. Before the loop starts, `h` being greater than 0 and `i` being 1 does not provide any information about `w`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 0. Additionally, `j` will start from 0 in the first iteration.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0**
