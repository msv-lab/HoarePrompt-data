According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` is currently 2, this means that `w` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue. Therefore, `w` needs to be adjusted to be at least 3. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `h` and `i` do not affect the loop's execution in this context.

State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `w` is at least 3**
