According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be at least 1, as the range function generates a sequence starting from 0 to `w-1`. The variable `j` will start from 0. Since `h` is greater than 0, it does not directly impact the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `w` needs to be greater than 0, `j` should start at 0. 

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
