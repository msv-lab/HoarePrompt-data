According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` is 2 and `w` is greater than 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented. Since `j` is currently 2, the loop can execute again only if `j` is less than `w`. Therefore, `w` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2.

Additionally, since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, we need to adjust `j` to 3 to reflect its value at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 2, and `j` is 3**
