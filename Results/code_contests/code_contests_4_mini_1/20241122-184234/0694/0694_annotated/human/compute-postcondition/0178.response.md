According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is 0 or lower, `h` is greater than 1, and `i` is equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `h` must be greater than 0. Since `h` is currently greater than 1, it needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. Additionally, `i` needs to be incremented to represent the next iteration. 

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that `h` remains greater than 1 (or can be just greater than 0), and `i` should change to 2 for the next iteration. 

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
