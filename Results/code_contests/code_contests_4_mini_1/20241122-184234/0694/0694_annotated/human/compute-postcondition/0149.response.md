According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has just executed for the first time with `j` set to 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1. Therefore, after the current iteration, `j` should be 1. Additionally, since `w` is greater than 0, it implies that `w` is at least 1, which means there's room for `j` to be 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted because the conditions concerning `i`, `h`, and the output are not relevant to the loop execution itself, but rather to what is done inside the loop.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
