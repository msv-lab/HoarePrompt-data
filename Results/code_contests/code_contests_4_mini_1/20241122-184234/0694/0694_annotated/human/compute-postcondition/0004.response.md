According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `h`. The loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0, as the range function specifies the number of iterations based on `h`. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the execution will break out of the loop. Thus, for the loop to be executed, `h` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer, `i` is 0**
