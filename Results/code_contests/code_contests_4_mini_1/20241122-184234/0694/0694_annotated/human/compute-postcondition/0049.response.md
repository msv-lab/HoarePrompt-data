The code executes a print statement that outputs a period (`.`) to the console. This action does not change the values of the previously defined variables `h`, `i`, `j`, or `w`. Therefore, the output state remains the same with no changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `w` is at least 1**
