Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are input integers. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop, resulting in no output. If either `h` or `w` is greater than 0, a rectangle of '#' and '.' characters was intended to be printed, but the execution may not proceed due to the break statement. If only `h` is 0, there is no output, and if `w` is 0, the inner loop does not execute, leading to no printed output.***
