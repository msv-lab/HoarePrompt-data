According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `j` and its relation to `w`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 2. Therefore, to allow for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, since `w` is greater than 2, it does not need to be adjusted.

So, the states to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be adjusted to 3.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
