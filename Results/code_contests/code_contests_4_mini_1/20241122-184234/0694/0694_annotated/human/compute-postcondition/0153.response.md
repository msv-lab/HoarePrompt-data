According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `w` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `w` for the loop to execute again.

To execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, so `j` should be adjusted to 2. Additionally, there is no need to change the values of `h` and `w` since they are already greater than 1 and 0 respectively.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2**
