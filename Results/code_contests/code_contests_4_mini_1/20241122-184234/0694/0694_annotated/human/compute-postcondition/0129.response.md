The code executes a print statement which outputs a dot ('.') to the console. This action does not change the values of any of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print operation has occurred, while the variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a dot ('.') has been printed.**
