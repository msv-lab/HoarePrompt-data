The code executes a print statement that outputs a dot ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the print function does not modify any variables or their states. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and a dot ('.') is printed.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `h` is greater than `i + 1`, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and a dot ('.') is printed**
