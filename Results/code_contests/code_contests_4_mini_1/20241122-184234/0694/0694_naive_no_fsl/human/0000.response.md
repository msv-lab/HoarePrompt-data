Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the frame drawing as specified in the problem description. 

1. The program uses `print('#')` for every '#' character, which results in each character being printed on a new line rather than in the correct row format. The correct behavior should print all characters in a single line for each row of the frame.

2. The condition for printing '#' is incorrect as well. The program checks for `i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or (j == w - 1)`, but it should check for the right edge of the frame as `j == w - 1` without parentheses. 

3. After printing each row, there is `print`, which does not print anything meaningful; it should be `print()` to create a new line after each row.

For example, if the input is `3 4`, the expected output should be:

```
####
#..#
####
```

But the program will output:

```
#
#
#
#
#
.
.
.
#
#
#
```

This confirms that the program does not meet the requirements as it fails to properly format the output for the frame.
