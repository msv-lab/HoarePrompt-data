The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a value `num`. It returns a matrix of size `n x m`, where each row contains the value `num` repeated `m` times, regardless of the type or content of `num`. There is no check for `num` being a list of different positive integers, and the function does not enforce any constraints on `num`.
