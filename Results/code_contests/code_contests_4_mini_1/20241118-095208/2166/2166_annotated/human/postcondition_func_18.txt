The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers, constructs a new list `b` by alternately taking elements from the end and the start of `a`, and counts the number of local minima in `b` (elements that are smaller than their immediate neighbors). If `n` is 0 or 1, the function does not perform the local minima count and `ans` remains 0. The function then calls `func_20` with `ans` and the unpacked list `b` as arguments, but does not return any value.
