The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `j` can be either `n - 1` or `n - 2`. After the operation, `j` will be either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1 if `i` is 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is `n`, and `b` has `a[j]` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1 if `i` is 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is `n`, and `b` has `a[j]` appended to it.**
