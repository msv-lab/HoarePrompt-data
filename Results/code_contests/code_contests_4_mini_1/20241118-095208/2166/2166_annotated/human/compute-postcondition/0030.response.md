The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `ans`, `j`, `k`, `b`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1 if `i` is 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is `n`, and `b` has `a[i]` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1 if `i` is 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is `n`, and `b` has `a[i]` appended to it.**
