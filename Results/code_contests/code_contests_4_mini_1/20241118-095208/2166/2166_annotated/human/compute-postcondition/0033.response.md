According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `n`, which means the loop cannot execute again since `k` is not less than `n`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Therefore, we can set `k` to `n` (the current value) and also ensure that `n` remains greater than 1 to allow for future iterations if necessary.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not directly impacting the ability of the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is `n`**
