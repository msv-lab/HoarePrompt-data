The statement `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the output stream represented by `file`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. The value of `sep` is a single space (' '), and the `file` variable refers to `sys.stdout`, which means that a space will be printed to the standard output. The values of `n`, `a`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 3 elements, x is the third element in args, and a space is written to the output.**
