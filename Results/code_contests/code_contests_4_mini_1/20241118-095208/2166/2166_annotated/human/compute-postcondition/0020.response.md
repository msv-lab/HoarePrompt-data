Output State: **`at_start` is False after at least one execution. If `args` contains at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `args`, writing each element to `file` separated by `sep`, except for the first element which is written without a separator. If `args` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `at_start` will remain True.**
