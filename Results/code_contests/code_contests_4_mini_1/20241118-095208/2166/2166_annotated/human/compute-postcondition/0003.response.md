According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute if `args` contains at least one element. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer, which means the list `a` will have `n` distinct positive integers.
- The variable `at_start` is set to `True`, which might indicate that the loop is starting fresh.

Since we have no information about the contents of `args`, we need to ensure that it has at least one element for the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `args` must contain at least one element. Additionally, we can assume that if `args` is not empty, the first element can be represented as `x` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, `args` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in args**
