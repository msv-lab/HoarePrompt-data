The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. Other variables such as `n`, `a`, `sep`, and `file` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, and `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, and `at_start` is True**
