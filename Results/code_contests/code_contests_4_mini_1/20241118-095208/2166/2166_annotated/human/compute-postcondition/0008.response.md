The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous state. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 1 element with `x` as the first element, and the value of `x` has been written to the output stream.
