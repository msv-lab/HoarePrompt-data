The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `at_start` is not specified, but it implies that it is being set to `False` regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 3 elements with `x` as the third element, and no changes were made to those variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 3 elements with `x` as the third element**
