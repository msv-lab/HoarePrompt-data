Postcondition: ***`b` contains elements from `a` arranged alternately from the end and the start, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 0, `f` is 0 if `n` is even, 1 if `n` is odd, `k` is `n - 1`, and `n` is greater than 2. If `b[i]` is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
