The `file.flush()` method is called, which flushes the internal buffer of the file object, ensuring that all data written to the file is physically written out to the underlying storage. The initial state indicates that `at_start` is `False`, but this does not affect the flushing of the file. The flush flag is set to `True`, confirming that the flush operation is valid. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, and the file has been flushed.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, and the file has been flushed.**
