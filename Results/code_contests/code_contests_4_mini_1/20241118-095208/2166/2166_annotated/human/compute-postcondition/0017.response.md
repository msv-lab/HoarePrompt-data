The code writes the string representation of `x` to the output file. The variable `x` is the third element in the `args` list, and its value is not specified in the initial state but is a distinct positive integer. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Since `at_start` is False, a space was written to the output file prior to this operation, but that does not affect the current operation of writing `str(x)`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 3 elements with `x` as the third element; `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.**
