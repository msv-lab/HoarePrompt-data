According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` list. Since `args` contains at least 1 element and `x` is the first element, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least 2 elements (so that there is a next element to iterate over), and `x` should be the second element in `args`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` has already been written to the output stream and is the first element of `args`. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, `x` should be updated to the second element in `args`, and the index of iteration should be incremented.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`.**
