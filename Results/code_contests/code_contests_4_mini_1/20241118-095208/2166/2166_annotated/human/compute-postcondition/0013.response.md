The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. Since `at_start` was already `False`, there is no change to its value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, and `args` contains at least 2 elements.
