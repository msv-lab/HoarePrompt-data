Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is `n`, if `f` is 0, `b` has `a[j]` appended to it, `j` is decremented by 1, and `f` is toggled; otherwise, `b` has `a[i]` appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, and `f` is toggled. In either case, the variable `f` will be toggled after the operation. Additionally, care must be taken that `i` and `j` remain within valid bounds for the list `a`.***
