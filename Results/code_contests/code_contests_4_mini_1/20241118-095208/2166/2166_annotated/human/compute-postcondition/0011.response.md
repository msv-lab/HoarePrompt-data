Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 2 elements, and if `at_start` is False, a space is written to `file`. If `at_start` is True, no changes are made to `file`.***
