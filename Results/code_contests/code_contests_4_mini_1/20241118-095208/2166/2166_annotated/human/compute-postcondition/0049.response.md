The function `func_19` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. However, the output or what the function returns has not been provided. Therefore, I cannot specify the functionality without knowing the return value based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, but the return value is not specified.**
