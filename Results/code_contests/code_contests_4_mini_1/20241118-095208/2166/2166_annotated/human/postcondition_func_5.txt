The function `func_6` initializes a new thread to run the `main` function without accepting any parameters. It sets the recursion limit and stack size for the thread, but it does not return any value or handle any exceptions that may occur. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of the `main` function, which is not specified in the provided code.
