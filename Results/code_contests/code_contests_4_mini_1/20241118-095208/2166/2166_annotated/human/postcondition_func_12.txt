The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`, and returns the number of ways to choose `r` ice spheres from `n` distinct ice spheres, calculated using the combination formula `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))`. It is important to note that if `r` is greater than `n`, the function will still return a valid integer due to the way the formula handles the factorial of negative numbers (which is not defined). In such cases, it will calculate based on the maximum of `n - r`, which could lead to incorrect interpretations if `r` exceeds `n`. Additionally, if `n` or `r` is negative, the behavior of the function is undefined since factorial is not defined for negative integers.
