The function accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, `True` if `n` is 2 or 3, and `False` if `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3. For values of `n` greater than 3 that are not divisible by 2 or 3, the function checks for divisibility by all integers of the form `6k Â± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime. The function does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is less than 1, but it would be implicitly handled by returning `False` for any such input.
