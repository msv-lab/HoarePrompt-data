The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object that contains the string representation of each input value entered by the user, separated by spaces. It does not handle input validation, so if the user inputs invalid data (e.g., non-integer strings), the function will still attempt to process it without errors, resulting in a map of those strings instead of integers.
