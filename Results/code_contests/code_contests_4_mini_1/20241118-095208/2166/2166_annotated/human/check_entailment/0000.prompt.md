You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in the easy version all prices a_i are different. You can make hacks if and only if you solved both versions of the problem.

Today is Sage's birthday, and she will go shopping to buy ice spheres. All n ice spheres are placed in a row and they are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each ice sphere has a positive integer price. In this version all prices are different.

An ice sphere is cheap if it costs strictly less than two neighboring ice spheres: the nearest to the left and the nearest to the right. The leftmost and the rightmost ice spheres are not cheap. Sage will choose all cheap ice spheres and then buy only them.

You can visit the shop before Sage and reorder the ice spheres as you wish. Find out the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy, and show how the ice spheres should be reordered.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of ice spheres in the shop.

The second line contains n different integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the prices of ice spheres.

Output

In the first line print the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy.

In the second line print the prices of ice spheres in the optimal order. If there are several correct answers, you can print any of them.

Example

Input


5
1 2 3 4 5


Output


2
3 1 4 2 5 

Note

In the example it's not possible to place ice spheres in any order so that Sage would buy 3 of them. If the ice spheres are placed like this (3, 1, 4, 2, 5), then Sage will buy two spheres: one for 1 and one for 2, because they are cheap.

If n is divisible by any of the values of `i` or `i + 2` encountered during the iterations, the function returns False, indicating that `n` is not prime. If n is less than 25, the loop will not execute and the function will return True, as 2, 3, and 5 are the only prime numbers less than 25. Therefore, if n is less than 25, the function will conclude that `n` is prime, and if n is 25 or greater, it may return False if a divisor is found, or continue checking further.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
