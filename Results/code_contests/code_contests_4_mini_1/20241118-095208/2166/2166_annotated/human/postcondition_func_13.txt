The function accepts two positive integer parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the result of the integer division `x // y` if `y` divides `x` evenly. If `y` does not divide `x` evenly, it returns `x // y + 1`. There is an assumption that `y` is non-zero; if `y` is zero, this will cause a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code.
