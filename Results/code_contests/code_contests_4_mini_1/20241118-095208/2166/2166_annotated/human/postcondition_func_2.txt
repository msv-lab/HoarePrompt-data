The function accepts an input string from the user, splits it into separate elements, and returns a map object containing integers parsed from those elements. It does not guarantee that the integers will be distinct or positive, as it simply converts all parsed string values to integers without any validation. Therefore, it returns a map of integers, which may include duplicates and negative values.
