The function accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `p` (a positive integer). It calculates the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. If `y` is 0 or negative, the function returns 1. If `y` is positive, it returns the result of the modular exponentiation. The function does not handle cases where `p` is 0, which would lead to a division by zero error in the modulo operation.
