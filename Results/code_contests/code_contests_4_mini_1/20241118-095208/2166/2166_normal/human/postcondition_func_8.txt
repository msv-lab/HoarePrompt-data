The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a value `num`, and returns a matrix of size `n x m`, where each element is the value `num`. The matrix consists of `n` rows, each containing `m` instances of `num`. It does not actually create a list of distinct positive integers as suggested in the annotations.
