The function accepts an integer `x` and returns True if `x` is a power of two (i.e., `x` is greater than 0 and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation), and returns False otherwise. It does not handle the case when `x` is zero or negative, resulting in potentially misleading behavior for those inputs.
