The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `r` (a non-negative integer), and returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!). However, it does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would lead to an incorrect calculation because the binomial coefficient is defined to be 0 in such cases. Additionally, if `n` is a negative integer, it may raise a ValueError when calculating the factorial. Thus, the function should ideally check if `n` is non-negative and if `r` is less than or equal to `n` before performing the calculation.
