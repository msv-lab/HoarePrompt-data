The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters and redirects standard input to read from 'input.txt' and standard output to write to 'output.txt'. However, it does not perform any operations on integers or lists, and it lacks any functionality related to processing input data or producing output based on computations. Thus, it simply sets up file redirection without any further processing or results.
