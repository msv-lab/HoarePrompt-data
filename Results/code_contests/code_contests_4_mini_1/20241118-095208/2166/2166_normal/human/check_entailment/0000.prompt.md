You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in the easy version all prices a_i are different. You can make hacks if and only if you solved both versions of the problem.

Today is Sage's birthday, and she will go shopping to buy ice spheres. All n ice spheres are placed in a row and they are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each ice sphere has a positive integer price. In this version all prices are different.

An ice sphere is cheap if it costs strictly less than two neighboring ice spheres: the nearest to the left and the nearest to the right. The leftmost and the rightmost ice spheres are not cheap. Sage will choose all cheap ice spheres and then buy only them.

You can visit the shop before Sage and reorder the ice spheres as you wish. Find out the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy, and show how the ice spheres should be reordered.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of ice spheres in the shop.

The second line contains n different integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the prices of ice spheres.

Output

In the first line print the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy.

In the second line print the prices of ice spheres in the optimal order. If there are several correct answers, you can print any of them.

Example

Input


5
1 2 3 4 5


Output


2
3 1 4 2 5 

Note

In the example it's not possible to place ice spheres in any order so that Sage would buy 3 of them. If the ice spheres are placed like this (3, 1, 4, 2, 5), then Sage will buy two spheres: one for 1 and one for 2, because they are cheap.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user. However, it does not handle any potential exceptions that could arise from invalid input (e.g., non-integer input), which could lead to a runtime error.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts user input and returns that input value. However, it does not accept any parameters, nor does it handle any specific cases related to the type of input (such as integers or lists), meaning it can return any type of input provided by the user, not just a positive integer or a list of distinct positive integers as the annotations suggest.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object that contains integers converted from a space-separated string input. The input may include non-integer values or empty input, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert those values to integers. The function does not handle these potential edge cases.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing the string representations of the input values obtained from user input, split by spaces. It does not specifically handle or filter for distinct positive integers, as the annotations suggest; it simply processes whatever input is provided by the user.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the result of calling func_3() as a list. It does not handle any potential edge cases or errors related to the output of func_3(), such as if func_3() returns None or any non-iterable object.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function sets a high recursion limit and a larger stack size, then starts a new thread that runs the `main` function. It does not accept any parameters or return any values, and it does not perform any operations related to a list or distinct positive integers as suggested in the annotations.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a list `item` and returns the second element of the list. However, if the list contains fewer than two elements, it will raise an `IndexError` due to attempting to access an index that does not exist.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list `l` and returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key defined in the function `getKey`. It does not impose any restrictions on the elements of the list, meaning it can accept lists with various types and values, not just distinct positive integers. Additionally, if `getKey` is not defined or if it raises an error, the function will not handle those cases, which could lead to a runtime error.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a value `num`, and returns a matrix of size `n x m`, where each element is the value `num`. The matrix consists of `n` rows, each containing `m` instances of `num`. It does not actually create a list of distinct positive integers as suggested in the annotations.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts an integer `x` and returns True if `x` is a power of two (i.e., `x` is greater than 0 and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation), and returns False otherwise. It does not handle the case when `x` is zero or negative, resulting in potentially misleading behavior for those inputs.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string, without the '0b' prefix. It does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which would result in a TypeError.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of its digits as integers. If `n` is negative, the function will still treat it as a string and include the digits of the absolute value but will not handle the negative sign, potentially leading to confusion in interpretation.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `r` (a non-negative integer), and returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!). However, it does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would lead to an incorrect calculation because the binomial coefficient is defined to be 0 in such cases. Additionally, if `n` is a negative integer, it may raise a ValueError when calculating the factorial. Thus, the function should ideally check if `n` is non-negative and if `r` is less than or equal to `n` before performing the calculation.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the result of integer division `x // y`. If `x` is not perfectly divisible by `y`, it returns `x // y + 1`, effectively rounding up the division result. The function assumes that `y` is never zero, which could lead to a division by zero error if `y` were to be zero.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, and returns the result of the modular exponentiation \( x^y \mod p \). If `y` is 0, the function returns 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the function will return the non-zero value (if one of them is zero) since the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself. If both are zero, the function will return zero, as GCD is undefined for zero.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1. It returns `True` if `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3. For values of `n` greater than 3, it returns `False` if `n` is divisible by either 2 or 3. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, it checks divisibility by 5 and 7, returning `False` if `n` is divisible by either of those. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. However, if `n` is equal to 4, the function does not explicitly handle this case and would proceed to the primality checks, returning `False`. The function does not handle the case when `n` is even and greater than 3 directly, as those cases are handled indirectly via the checks for divisibility by 2.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters and redirects standard input to read from 'input.txt' and standard output to write to 'output.txt'. However, it does not perform any operations on integers or lists, and it lacks any functionality related to processing input data or producing output based on computations. Thus, it simply sets up file redirection without any further processing or results.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_5()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    j = n - 1
    b = []
    f = 0
    for k in range(n):
        if f == 0:
            b.append(a[j])
            j -= 1
            f ^= 1
        else:

    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if b[i] < b[i - 1] and b[i] < b[i + 1]:
            ans += 1
    func_20(ans)
    func_20(*b)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and creates a list `b` by alternately taking elements from the end and the beginning of another list `a` of size `n`. It then counts how many elements in `b` (from index 1 to n - 2) are smaller than both their neighbors, storing this count in `ans`. Finally, it calls `func_20` with `ans` and the elements of `b`, but it does not return any value. If `n` is less than 3, `ans` will be 0 as the loop will not execute, and `b` will contain `n` elements based on the alternation logic.

 Output decription for function20:  The function does not accept any parameters and prints the string representations of elements in `args` to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`). It also writes a specified ending string (defaulting to a newline) after the printed elements. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output stream. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed before the ending string is written. The function does not handle cases where `args` might not be defined, so it presumes that `args` is a valid iterable.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
