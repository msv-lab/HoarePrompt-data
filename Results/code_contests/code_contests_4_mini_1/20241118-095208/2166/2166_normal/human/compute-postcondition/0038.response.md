Postcondition: ***`b` is a list containing the first `n` elements formed by alternately taking elements from the end and the beginning of `a`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is -1, `f` is 0. If `b[1]` is less than both `b[0]` and `b[2]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, resulting in `ans` being 1. If `b[1]` is not less than both `b[0]` and `b[2]`, then `ans` remains 0. The function ensures that `b` contains at least three elements due to the condition on `n`.***
