The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1. Therefore, after execution, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`b`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements formed by alternately taking elements from the end and the beginning of `a`, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 2.

Output State: **`b` is a list containing the first `n` elements formed by alternately taking elements from the end and the beginning of `a`, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 2**
