Output State: **`b` is a list containing the first `n` elements formed by alternately taking elements from the end and the beginning of `a`, starting from the last element of `a` and ending with the first element of `a`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times. If `n` is 0 (though it is stated that 1 â‰¤ `n`), then the loop does not execute, and `b` remains an empty list; `i` is still 0, `j` is -1, `f` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**
