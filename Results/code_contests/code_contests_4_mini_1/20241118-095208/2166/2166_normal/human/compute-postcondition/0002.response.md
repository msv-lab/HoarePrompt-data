The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. This does not affect any of the other variables in the state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout; `at_start` is True.
