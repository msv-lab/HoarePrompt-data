Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and prints the string representations of elements in `args` to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`). It also writes a specified ending string (defaulting to a newline) after the printed elements. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output stream. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed before the ending string is written. The function does not handle cases where `args` might not be defined, so it presumes that `args` is a valid iterable. **
