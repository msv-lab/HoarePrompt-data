The code snippet unpacks the `kwargs` dictionary to retrieve the values associated with the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`. The default value for `sep` is a space `' '`, and for `file`, it is `sys.stdout`. Since there are no changes to the variables `n` or `a`, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout**
