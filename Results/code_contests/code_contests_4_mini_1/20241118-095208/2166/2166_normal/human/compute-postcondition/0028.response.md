The variable `f` is toggled using the XOR operation with `1`. This means if `f` was initially `0`, it will become `1`, and if it was `1`, it will become `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `f`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 0 or 1 or 2; `j` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3` or `n - 4`; `b` is a list containing one additional element from `a`; `f` is toggled; `k` is 1**
