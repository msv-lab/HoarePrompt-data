Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 1, 2, or 3; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`; `b` now includes `a[i]`; `f` is toggled; `k` is 1**
