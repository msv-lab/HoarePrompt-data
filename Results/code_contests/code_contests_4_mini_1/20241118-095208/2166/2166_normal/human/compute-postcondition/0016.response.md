Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is ' ', `file` writes a space character to the output only if `at_start` is False, indicating that the output is not at the start of a sequence. If `at_start` is True, no action is performed regarding `file`.***
