The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep`, which is a single space character, to the output stream represented by `file`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The output from this operation does not affect the values of any variables; it simply results in a space being written to the output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is ' ', `file` writes a space character to output, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`**
