According to the code, the loop iterates `k` from 0 to `n-1`, so it will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would have been incremented to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n`. 

Since `k` is currently equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust it back to allow the loop to execute another iteration. Therefore, `k` should be reset to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `ans` is 0; `i` is either modified to 1, 2, or 3, depending on whether `f` was toggled; `j` is either decreased by 1, 2, or 3, depending on the value of `f`; `b` includes either `a[j]` if `f` was initially 0 or `a[i]` if `f` was initially 1; `f` is toggled from its initial state; `k` is 0**
