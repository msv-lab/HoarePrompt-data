The function `func_20` does not have any parameters. It operates with the defined constraints where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Based on these inputs, the function produces an output based on certain conditions or calculations related to the list of integers. However, the specific output behavior is not described.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes internal constraints related to a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a, returning an output based on these inputs.**
