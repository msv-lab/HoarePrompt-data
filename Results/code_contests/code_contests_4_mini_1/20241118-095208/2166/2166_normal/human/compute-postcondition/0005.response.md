The code `file.write(sep)` writes the string value of `sep` to the output file `file`. The value of `sep` is a space (' '), and it does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`, and a space has been written to the output file.
