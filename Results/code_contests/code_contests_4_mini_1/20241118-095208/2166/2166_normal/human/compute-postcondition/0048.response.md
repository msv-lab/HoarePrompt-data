The function `func_20(*b)` is called, but we don't have any information on how this function modifies the variables `ans`, `i`, `j`, or `f`. Since the initial values of these variables remain unchanged and the function is returning `ans`, which is 0, the output state reflects that no changes have taken place in the variables.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is -1, `f` is 0, and the function returns 0**
