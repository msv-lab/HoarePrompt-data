Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `ans` is 0; `i` is either modified to 1, 2, or 3, depending on whether `f` was toggled; `j` is either decreased by 1, 2, or 3, depending on the value of `f`; `b` includes either `a[j]` if `f` was initially 0 or `a[i]` if `f` was initially 1; `f` is toggled from its initial state; `k` remains 1.***
