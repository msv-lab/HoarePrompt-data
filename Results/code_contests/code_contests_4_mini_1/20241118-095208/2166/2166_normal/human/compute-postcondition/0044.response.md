Postcondition: ***`b` is a list containing the first `n` elements formed by alternately taking elements from the end and the beginning of `a`, where `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, and `ans` is initially 1. If `b[2]` is less than both its neighboring elements `b[1]` and `b[3]`, then `ans` is incremented to 2. If not, `ans` remains 1.***
