Postcondition: ***`kwargs` has been modified by popping the key 'end' if it exists. If the key 'flush' was present in `kwargs` and its value was True, then `file` is flushed. If 'flush' was not present or False, no action is taken on `file`. In both cases, `file` has previously been written to with either the value of `kwargs['end']` if it existed or a newline character.***
