Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is a boolean value, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, a space is written to the output file; if `at_start` is True, no action is taken regarding the output file.***
