The function accepts a positive integer `n` and creates a list `b` by alternately taking elements from the end and the beginning of another list `a` of size `n`. It then counts how many elements in `b` (from index 1 to n - 2) are smaller than both their neighbors, storing this count in `ans`. Finally, it calls `func_20` with `ans` and the elements of `b`, but it does not return any value. If `n` is less than 3, `ans` will be 0 as the loop will not execute, and `b` will contain `n` elements based on the alternation logic.
