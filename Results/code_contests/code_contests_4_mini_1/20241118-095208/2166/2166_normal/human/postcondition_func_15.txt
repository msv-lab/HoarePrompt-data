The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the function will return the non-zero value (if one of them is zero) since the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself. If both are zero, the function will return zero, as GCD is undefined for zero.
