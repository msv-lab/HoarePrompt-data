The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the result of integer division `x // y`. If `x` is not perfectly divisible by `y`, it returns `x // y + 1`, effectively rounding up the division result. The function assumes that `y` is never zero, which could lead to a division by zero error if `y` were to be zero.
