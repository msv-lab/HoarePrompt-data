You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hacker Zhorik wants to decipher two secret messages he intercepted yesterday. Yeah message is a sequence of encrypted blocks, each of them consists of several bytes of information.

Zhorik knows that each of the messages is an archive containing one or more files. Zhorik knows how each of these archives was transferred through the network: if an archive consists of k files of sizes l1, l2, ..., lk bytes, then the i-th file is split to one or more blocks bi, 1, bi, 2, ..., bi, mi (here the total length of the blocks bi, 1 + bi, 2 + ... + bi, mi is equal to the length of the file li), and after that all blocks are transferred through the network, maintaining the order of files in the archive.

Zhorik thinks that the two messages contain the same archive, because their total lengths are equal. However, each file can be split in blocks in different ways in the two messages.

You are given the lengths of blocks in each of the two messages. Help Zhorik to determine what is the maximum number of files could be in the archive, if the Zhorik's assumption is correct.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) — the number of blocks in the first and in the second messages.

The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 106) — the length of the blocks that form the first message.

The third line contains m integers y1, y2, ..., ym (1 ≤ yi ≤ 106) — the length of the blocks that form the second message.

It is guaranteed that x1 + ... + xn = y1 + ... + ym. Also, it is guaranteed that x1 + ... + xn ≤ 106.

Output

Print the maximum number of files the intercepted array could consist of.

Examples

7 6
2 5 3 1 11 4 4

Input

1 4
4
1 1 1 1


Output

1

Note

In the first example the maximum number of files in the archive is 3. For example, it is possible that in the archive are three files of sizes 2 + 5 = 7, 15 = 3 + 1 + 11 = 8 + 2 + 4 + 1 and 4 + 4 = 8.

In the second example it is possible that the archive contains two files of sizes 1 and 110 = 10 + 100 = 100 + 10. Note that the order of files is kept while transferring archives through the network, so we can't say that there are three files of sizes 1, 10 and 100.

In the third example the only possibility is that the archive contains a single file of size 4.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    q1 = raw_input().split()
    q2 = raw_input().split()
    q3 = raw_input().split()
    s1 = int(q2[0])
    s2 = int(q3[0])
    f = 0
    p1 = 0
    p2 = 0
    a1 = int(q1[0])
    a2 = int(q1[1])
    while p1 < a1 and p2 < a2:
        if s1 == s2:
            s1 = 0
            s2 = 0
            f = f + 1
            p1 = p1 + 1
            p2 = p2 + 1
        
        if s1 < s2:
            p1 = p1 + 1
            s1 = s1 + int(q2[p1])
        
        if s1 > s2:
            p2 = p2 + 1
            s2 = s2 + int(q3[p2])
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `if p1 < a1 and p2 < a2 then f is the count of equal pairs found based on s1 and s2; s1 and s2 are the sums of elements from q2 and q3 respectively up to their respective indexes p1 and p2. If s1 equals s2, then both are reset to 0, p1 and p2 are incremented, and f is increased by 1. If s1 is less than s2, p1 is incremented and s1 is updated based on the next value in q2; if s1 is greater than s2, p2 is incremented and s2 is updated based on the next value in q3. If p1 reaches a1 or p2 reaches a2, the loop terminates. If the initial values of s1 and s2 are equal, f is incremented immediately, and both variables are reset. The final values are p1 equal to the number of increments made, p2 equal to the number of increments made, and f indicating the total pairs found. If p1 or p2 starts at a value equal to or greater than a1 or a2, respectively, the loop does not execute and f remains 0.
    print(f)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
