The function accepts two lists of integers inputted from the user. It counts and prints the number of equal sums found between the two lists as it iterates through them. The function increments pointers in each list depending on the comparison of their respective sums, resetting the sums to zero whenever they are equal, and stops when it reaches the end of either list. If either list is initially empty or the sums never match, the function will output 0.
