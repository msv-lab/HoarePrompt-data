The variable `q1` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The initial state does not affect the elements within the lists `x` and `y` or the integers `n` and `m`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `q1` is now a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n integers; `y` is a list of m integers; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from input**
