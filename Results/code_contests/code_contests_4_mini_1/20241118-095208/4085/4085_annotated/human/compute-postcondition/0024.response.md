Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; `s1`, `s2` are the integer values of the first elements of `q2` and `q3`, respectively. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1, and `s2` is updated by adding `int(q3[p2])`, while `s1`, `p1`, `f`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. If `s1` equals `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1. If `s1` is less than `s2`, `s1` remains unchanged, `p1` and `p2` are unaffected, and `f` retains its previous value, while `a1` and `a2` continue to hold the integer values of `q1[0]` and `q1[1]`, respectively. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `f`, `a1`, and `a2` are preserved across all cases, while `s1` and `s2` are only modified according to their comparisons.***
