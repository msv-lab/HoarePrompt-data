Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; `s1` is greater than or equal to `s2`; `s1` remains unchanged; `p1` and `p2` are unaffected; `f` retains its previous value; `a1` and `a2` hold the integer values of `q1[0]` and `q1[1]`, respectively.***
