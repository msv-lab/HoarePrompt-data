The variable `p2` is assigned the value of `p2 + 1`. The previous value of `p2` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `p2`. The values of `f` and `p1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the increase of `p2` by 1 while acknowledging that its previous value is unknown.

Output State: **`f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1 but its previous value is unknown, and `p2` is increased by 1 from an unknown value.**
