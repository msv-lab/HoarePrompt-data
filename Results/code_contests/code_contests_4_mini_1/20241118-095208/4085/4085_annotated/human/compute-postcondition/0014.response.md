The value of `p1` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `p1` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `p1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n integers; `y` is a list of m integers; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from input through raw_input(); `q3` is a list of strings split from raw_input(); `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `f` is increased by 1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]`; `a2` is the integer value of `q1[1]`**
