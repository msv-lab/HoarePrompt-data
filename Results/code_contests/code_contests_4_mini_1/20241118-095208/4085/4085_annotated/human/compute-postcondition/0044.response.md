Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers with 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; if `s1` equals `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are increased by 1, while `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged otherwise. Additionally, `p1` is always less than `a1`, and `p2` is less than `a2 - 1` if `s1` is greater than `s2`, otherwise `p2` is less than `a2`.***
