The code increments `p1` by 1, but the initial value of `p1` is unknown. The variable `f` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `f` is increased by 1, and `p1` is increased by 1, but its previous value is unknown.

Output State: **`f` is increased by 1, and `p1` is increased by 1 but its previous value is unknown**
