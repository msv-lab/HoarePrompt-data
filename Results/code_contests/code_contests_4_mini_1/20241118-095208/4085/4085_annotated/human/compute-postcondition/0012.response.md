The code assigns the value `0` to `s2`. The previous value of `s2` (which was equal to the integer value of the first element of `q3`) is now changed to `0`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n integers; `y` is a list of m integers; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from input through raw_input(); `q3` is a list of strings split from raw_input(); `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]`; `a2` is the integer value of `q1[1]`**
