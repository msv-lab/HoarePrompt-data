The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `int(q1[0])`, where `q1` is a list of strings obtained from input. The value of `q1[0]` is the first string in the list `q1`, and it is converted to an integer. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n integers; `y` is a list of m integers; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from input through raw_input(); `q3` is a list of strings split from raw_input(); `s1` is the integer value of the first element of `q2`; `s2` is the integer value of the first element of `q3`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n integers; `y` is a list of m integers; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from input through raw_input(); `q3` is a list of strings split from raw_input(); `s1` is the integer value of the first element of `q2`; `s2` is the integer value of the first element of `q3`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]`.**
