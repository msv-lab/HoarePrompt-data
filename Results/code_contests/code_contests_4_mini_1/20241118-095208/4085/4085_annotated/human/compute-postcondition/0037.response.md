Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; `s1` is the integer value of the first element of `q2`; `s2` is the integer value of the first element of `q3`; `p1` is less than `a1`, and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1, and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`, ensuring that `p2` remains within bounds. If `s1` is not greater than `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, maintaining their previous states. Additionally, it's important to note that `p2` must still respect the boundary conditions set by `a2` after any potential increment.***
