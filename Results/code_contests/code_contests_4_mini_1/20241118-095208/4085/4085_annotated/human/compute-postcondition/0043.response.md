The code assigns `p2` the value of `p2 + 1`, which means that `p2` is incremented by 1. The values of `f`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged, while `p1` has already been increased by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects that `p2` has changed, while the others remain as they were.

Output State: **`f` is increased by 1; `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2` remain unchanged; `p1` is increased by 1; `p2` is increased by 1**
