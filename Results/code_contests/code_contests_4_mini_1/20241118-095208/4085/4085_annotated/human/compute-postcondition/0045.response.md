The value of `p1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p1` is unknown, but it is guaranteed to be less than `a1`. The states of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `p2`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `p1` by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers with 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; `p1` is increased by 1; `p2` is less than `a2 - 1` if `s1` is greater than `s2`, otherwise `p2` is less than `a2`.**
