Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers with 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1, and `s2` is updated by adding `int(q3[p2])` to it, while `s1`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, ensuring that `p1` remains less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2` (specifically `p2 < a2 - 1` if `s1 > s2`). If `s1` is not greater than `s2`, then `s1`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, maintaining the original conditions.***
