Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; `s1` is an integer value from `q2`, and `s2` is an integer value from `q3`. `s1` is less than `s2`; if `s1` equals `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1; otherwise, `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged, and `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are unaffected. The values of `a1` and `a2` remain as the integer values of `q1[0]` and `q1[1]`, respectively.***
