The variable `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]` to it. The value of `p1` has been increased by 1, which allows us to access the next index of the list `q2`. The previous state of `s1` is unknown since it is not provided, but after the operation, `s1` will be updated accordingly. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `s1` and the increment in `p1`.

Output State: **`s1` is updated by adding int(q2[p1]), `p1` is increased by 1**
