The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `int(q1[1])`, which means that `a2` will hold the integer representation of the second element of the list `q1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current values of all the variables, including the newly assigned value of `a2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n integers; `y` is a list of m integers; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from input through raw_input(); `q3` is a list of strings split from raw_input(); `s1` is the integer value of the first element of `q2`; `s2` is the integer value of the first element of `q3`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]`; `a2` is the integer value of `q1[1]`.**
