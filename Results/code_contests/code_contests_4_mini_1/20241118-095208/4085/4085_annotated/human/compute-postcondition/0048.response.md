Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers with 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; `p1` is increased by 1 if `s1` is less than `s2`, while `s1` is updated by adding `int(q2[p1])` to it; `p2` is increased by 1; if `s1` is not less than `s2`, then `s1`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged; the condition that `p1` is always less than `a1`, and `p2` is less than `a2 - 1` if `s1` is greater than `s2`, or `p2` is less than `a2`, is retained throughout the execution.**
