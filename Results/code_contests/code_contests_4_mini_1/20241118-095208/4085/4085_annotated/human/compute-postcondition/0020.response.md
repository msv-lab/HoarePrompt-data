Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; `s1` and `s2` are the integer values of the first elements of `q2` and `q3`, respectively. If `s1` equals `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `s1` is increased by `int(q2[p1])` and `p1` is incremented by 1 while `f`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. If `s1` is greater than or equal to `s2`, then `s1` remains unchanged, `p1` and `p2` are unaffected, and `f` remains the same. The values of `a1` and `a2` continue to hold the integer values of `q1[0]` and `q1[1]`, respectively.***
