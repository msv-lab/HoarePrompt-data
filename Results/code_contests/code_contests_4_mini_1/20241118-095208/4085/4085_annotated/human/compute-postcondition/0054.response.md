The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Here, `x` is a list of `n` positive integers representing lengths of blocks in the first message, and `y` is a list of `m` positive integers representing lengths of blocks in the second message. The function ensures that the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. The specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two lists of positive integers, `x` and `y`, with the constraint that their sums are equal, but the exact return value is not specified in the output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, x and y, containing positive integers, ensuring that the sum of elements in x equals the sum of elements in y.**
