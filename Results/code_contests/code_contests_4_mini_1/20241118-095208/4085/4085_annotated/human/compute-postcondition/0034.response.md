Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of `n` integers; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from input; `s1`, `s2` are the integer values of the first elements of `q2` and `q3`, respectively; `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated by adding `int(q2[p1])`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1. If `s1` is not less than `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. This covers all the conditions and possible changes in variable states for the given program fragment.***
