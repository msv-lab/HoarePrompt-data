n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; x is a list of n integers (lengths of blocks in the first message) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ xi ≤ 10^6; y is a list of m integers (lengths of blocks in the second message) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ yi ≤ 10^6; and the sum of elements in x is equal to the sum of elements in y.
