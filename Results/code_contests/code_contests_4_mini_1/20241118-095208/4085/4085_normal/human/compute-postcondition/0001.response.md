The variable `q2` is assigned the value resulting from `raw_input().split()`, which means it will hold a list of strings obtained from user input. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `q2` is a list of strings from user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `q2` is a list of strings from user input**
