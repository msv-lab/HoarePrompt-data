The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with two messages, each represented by a number of blocks. The constraints specify that `n` and `m` are positive integers, which represent the number of blocks in the first and second messages respectively, and that the lengths of these blocks are provided as lists of positive integers. Additionally, the total length of blocks in each message must be equal.

Since there are no explicit parameters to accept, the function likely processes the input internally or relies on predefined values. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes two messages composed of blocks of equal total length, but the specific output or functionality is not defined in the provided information.**
