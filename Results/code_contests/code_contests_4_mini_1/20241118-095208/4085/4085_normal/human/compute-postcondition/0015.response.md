The value of `p2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p2` is 0, so after execution, `p2` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the error due to `q1` being undefined persists. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `q2` is a list of strings from user input, `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is 1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `a1` is undefined, and an error occurs due to `q1` being undefined.
