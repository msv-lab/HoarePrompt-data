The variable `s1` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect the other variables `n`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, or `a2`, which retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `s1` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `p1` is less than `a1; p2` is less than `a2; `s1` is 0**
