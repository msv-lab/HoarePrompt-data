The variable `s2` is assigned the value of `int(q3[0])`, where `q3` is a list of strings split by spaces from user input. The first element of `q3` is converted to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, `q2`, and `s1` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged values of the other variables and the new value of `s2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `q2` is a list of strings from user input, `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces, `s1` is the integer value of the first element of `q2`, and `s2` is the integer value of the first element of `q3`.**
