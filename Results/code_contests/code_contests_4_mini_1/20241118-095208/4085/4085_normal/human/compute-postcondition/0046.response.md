The variable `s1` is updated by adding the value of `int(q2[p1])` to it. The value of `p1` has been increased by 1, which means it now points to the next index in the `q2` list (assuming `q2` is defined and has enough elements). The variables `n` and `m` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes in `s1` and `p1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `p1` is now increased by 1; `s1` is updated by adding int(q2[p1])**
