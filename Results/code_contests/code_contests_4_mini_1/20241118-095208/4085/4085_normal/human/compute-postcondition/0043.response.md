The value of `p2` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `p2` is less than `a2`, but does not specify the exact value of `p2`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `p2` has increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `p1` is increased by 1; `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; and `f` is increased by 1; `p2` is increased by 1**
