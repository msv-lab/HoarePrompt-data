Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers, `q2` is a list of strings from user input, and `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]`. If `s1` is equal to or greater than `s2`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, or `p2`. Additionally, if `p1` exceeds the bounds of the `q2` list, an error may occur due to an attempt to access an undefined index.***
