Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers; `q2` is a list of strings from user input; `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces; if `s1` is greater than `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated by adding the integer value of `q3[p2]`. If `s1` is less than or equal to `s2`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, or `p2`. Additionally, if `p1` exceeds the bounds of the `q2` list during this operation, an error may occur due to an attempt to access an undefined index.***
