Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers; `q2` is a list of strings from user input; `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is increased by 1, and `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and `p1` is increased by 1, provided that `p2` was initially equal to or greater than `a2`, and if `p2` was equal to `a2`, it is adjusted to be less than `a2` before evaluating the condition. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, the program state remains unchanged. In all cases, the relationships among `s1`, `s2`, `p1`, and `p2` are preserved according to the specified conditions.***
