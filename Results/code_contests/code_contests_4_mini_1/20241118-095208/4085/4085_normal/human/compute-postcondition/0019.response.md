The value of `p1` is used to index into the list `q2`, and the value at that index is converted to an integer and added to `s1`. Since `p1` has been increased by 1, it will now reference the next index of `q2`. The previous values of `s1` and `q2` are not specified, but the operation will impact `s1` by increasing it by the integer value of `q2[p1]`. Therefore, the output state is: `p1` is increased by 1, and `s1` is updated with the addition of `int(q2[p1])`.

Output State: **`p1` is increased by 1, and `s1` is updated with the addition of `int(q2[p1])**
