The variable `s1` is updated by adding the integer conversion of the string at index `p1` from the list `q2`. The variable `p1` has been increased by 1, which means it now points to the next index in `q2`. Since `n` and `m` are positive integers, they do not affect the calculation for `s1`. The specific values of `q2` and `s1` are unknown, but we know `q2` contains strings and `s1` is an integer.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `q2` is a list of strings from user input; `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces; `p1` is increased by 1; `s1` is updated by adding `int(q2[p1])`.**
