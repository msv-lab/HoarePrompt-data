The line of code `q1 = raw_input().split()` takes input from the user as a raw string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The previous state of `n` and `m` is not directly affected by this line, but it introduces the variable `q1`, which will store the resulting list of strings from the input.

Since `n` and `m` are positive integers, and the lengths of the blocks in both messages are lists of positive integers where the total length of blocks in each message is equal, we can assume that the input will consist of some positive integers.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `q1` is a list of strings resulting from the input split**.
