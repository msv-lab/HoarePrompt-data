Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `q2` is a list of strings from user input, `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1. If `q1` is not defined, an error occurs, leaving `a1` undefined. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, no changes are made to the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, or `p2`.***
