`p2` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `m`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `q2` is a list of strings from user input, `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces, `s1` is the integer value of the first element of `q2`, `s2` is the integer value of the first element of `q3`, `f` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0.
