The variable `s2` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers; `p1` is less than `a1; p2` is less than `a2; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `p1` is less than `a1; p2` is less than `a2; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0**
