Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers; `q2` is a list of strings from user input; `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces; if `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is also increased by 1, provided that `p2` was initially equal to or greater than `a2`. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, the program state remains unchanged. Note that if `p2` was equal to `a2`, it is adjusted to be less than `a2` before evaluating the condition.***
