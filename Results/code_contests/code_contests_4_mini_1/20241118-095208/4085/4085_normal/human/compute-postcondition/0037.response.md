Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers; `q2` is a list of strings from user input; `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1, and `s2` is updated by adding the integer value of `q3[p2]`. If `s1` is less than or equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` maintain their values, and no changes occur to `p2`. The relationships among `s1`, `s2`, `p1`, and `p2` are preserved according to the specified conditions, ensuring that all variables retain their defined relationships after the execution of the program fragment. Additionally, if `p2` was equal to `a2` prior to this execution, it is adjusted to be less than `a2` before evaluating the condition.***
