Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1 and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are increased by 1, with the condition that `p2` remains less than `a2`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.***
