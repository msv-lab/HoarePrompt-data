Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers, `q2` is a list of strings from user input, `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by spaces. `s1` is greater than `s2`, and no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, or `p2`. Additionally, if `p1` is within the bounds of the `q2` list, no error occurs.***
