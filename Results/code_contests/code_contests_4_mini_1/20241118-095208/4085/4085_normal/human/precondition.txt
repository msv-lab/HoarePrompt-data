n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; the lengths of blocks in the first message are a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xn where each xi is between 1 and 10^6; the lengths of blocks in the second message are a list of integers y1, y2, ..., ym where each yi is between 1 and 10^6; the sum of the lengths of blocks in both messages is equal.
