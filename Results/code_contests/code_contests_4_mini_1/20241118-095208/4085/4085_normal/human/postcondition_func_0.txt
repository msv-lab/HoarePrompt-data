The function reads input from the user to retrieve two sequences of integers and processes them to count how many times the cumulative sums of the two sequences become equal. It does not accept any parameters and prints the count of such occurrences (`f`). The function may encounter an index error if the lengths of the sequences are not managed properly, as it assumes valid input sizes for the processing loop. If either sequence has a length of 0 or less, the function will not perform any calculations and will print 0.
