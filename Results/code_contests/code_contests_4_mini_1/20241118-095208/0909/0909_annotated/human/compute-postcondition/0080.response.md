The variable `ans` is assigned the value of 0, which does not affect any other variables since it is a new assignment. The previous values of `j`, `gaps`, `gl`, and `special` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of all relevant variables without altering their states.

Output State: **`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `ans` is 0**.
