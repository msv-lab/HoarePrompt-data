The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `j` is increased by 1, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is updated based on the value of `gl`, `i` is current index plus 1, `ax` is the next element in a.
