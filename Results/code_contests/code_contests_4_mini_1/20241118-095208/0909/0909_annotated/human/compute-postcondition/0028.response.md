The variable `gaps` is initialized as an empty list. This operation does not affect the previous values of the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, or `mx`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `gaps` is now an empty list while the other variables retain their previous values from `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference sa - sb, and `gaps` is an empty list**.
