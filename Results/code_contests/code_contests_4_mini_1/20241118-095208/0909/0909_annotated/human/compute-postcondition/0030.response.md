The variable `gl` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `mx`, `gaps`, and `j`) remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference sa - sb, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is 0, and `gl` is 0**.
