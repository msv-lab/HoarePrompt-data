Postcondition: ***`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains the values of `gl`, which is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `ans` is updated based on the comparison of `x` and `y * k`. If `x` is less than `y * k`, `ans` is the sum of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` for each element `g` in `gaps`, or remains 0 if `gaps` is empty. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, `ans` is equal to the sum of `y * g` for each element `g` in `gaps`, or remains 0 if `gaps` is empty.***
