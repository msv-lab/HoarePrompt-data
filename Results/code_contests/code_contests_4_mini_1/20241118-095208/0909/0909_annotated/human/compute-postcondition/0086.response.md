According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `gaps` list. The loop will iterate over each element in `gaps`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the `gaps` list must have at least one more element than it did at the end of the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `g` is the second element of `gaps`, and `gaps` contains at least 2 elements. This means that there is at least one more element in `gaps` that the loop can iterate over. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `gaps` contains at least 3 elements.

State: **`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far; `gaps` contains at least 3 elements; `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements; `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`; `ans` is updated by adding `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`; `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`; `g` is the third element of `gaps`.**
