The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of the variables `j`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, and `specialgap` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any of them. Therefore, the output state reflects their current values without any changes.

Output State: **`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `specialgap` is less than `k`, and the code prints -1.**
