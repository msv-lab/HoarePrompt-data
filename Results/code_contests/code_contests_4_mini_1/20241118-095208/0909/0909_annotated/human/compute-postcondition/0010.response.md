The value of `j` is incremented by 1, meaning if `j` was initially 0, it will become 1; if it was already 1, it will become 2. However, the previous value of `j` is unknown since it can either remain 0 or increase to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are also values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element in `a`.
