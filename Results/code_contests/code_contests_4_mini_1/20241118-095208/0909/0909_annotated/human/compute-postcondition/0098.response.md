Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of `y` multiplied by each element in `gaps`, `j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains all elements that were processed, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`. If `gaps` is empty, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains 0.**
