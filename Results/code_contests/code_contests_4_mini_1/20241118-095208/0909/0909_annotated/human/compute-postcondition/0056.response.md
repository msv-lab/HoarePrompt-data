Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` contains the value of `gl` if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, `special` is set to True if `ax` is equal to `mx`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `gl` is increased by 1.**
