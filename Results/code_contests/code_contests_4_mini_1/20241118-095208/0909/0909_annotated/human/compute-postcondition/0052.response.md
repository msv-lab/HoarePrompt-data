The variable `gl` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the affected variables were:
- `j` was incremented by 1 (but its previous value is unknown).
- `special` remains either true or false.
- `specialgap` remains unchanged (value is unknown).
- `gaps` has `gl` appended to it, so `0` will be added to `gaps`.

Since `gaps` is appended with the value of `gl`, the output state will reflect that `gl` is now 0, while the other variables remain unchanged in their respective states.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1; `special` is true or false; `specialgap` remains unchanged; `gaps` has 0 appended to it.**
