The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. The previous values of the affected variables (if they are mentioned) are checked, but `gl` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `specialgap` is updated based on `gl`, but the specific value of `gl` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is updated based on the value of `gl`, `i` is current index plus 1, `ax` is the next element in `a`, and `specialgap` is updated based on `gl`**.
