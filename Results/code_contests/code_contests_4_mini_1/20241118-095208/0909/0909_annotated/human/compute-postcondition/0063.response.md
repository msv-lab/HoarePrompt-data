The variable `gl` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables (`j`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `mx`, `gaps`, `i`, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all the variables, including the new value of `gl`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` now includes `gl`, `i` is current index plus 1, `ax` is the next element in `a`, `special` is true or false, `specialgap` is updated based on `gl` if `special` is true, otherwise it remains unchanged; `gl` is 0.**
