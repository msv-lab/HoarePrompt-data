The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is currently 0. The assignment does not affect any other variables in the state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new assignment.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is an integer less than `m` and is now incremented by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is True, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`, and `specialgap` is 0**.
