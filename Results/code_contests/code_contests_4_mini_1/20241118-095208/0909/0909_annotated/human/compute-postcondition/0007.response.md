The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since `j` is less than `m`, the new value of `j` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`, `j` is less than `m`, and the first element of `a` (which is `ax`) is equal to `b[j]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`, `j` is less than `m`, and the first element of `a` (which is `ax`) is equal to `b[j]`.**
