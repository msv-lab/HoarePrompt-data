The variable `special` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `j` is incremented by 1, `special` can be either true or false, `specialgap` remains unchanged, and `gaps` has 0 appended to it, but now `special` is explicitly set to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1; `special` is False; `specialgap` remains unchanged; `gaps` has 0 appended to it.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1; `special` is False; `specialgap` remains unchanged; `gaps` has 0 appended to it.**
