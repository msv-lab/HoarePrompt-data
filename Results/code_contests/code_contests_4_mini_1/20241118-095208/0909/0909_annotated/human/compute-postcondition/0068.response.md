Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` includes the updated value of `gl`, `i` is current index plus 1, and `ax` is the next element in `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, `gaps` now includes the current value of `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` retains its previous value. Otherwise, if `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True, and `gl` is incremented by 1. The logic accounts for cases where `j` is equal to or greater than `m`, and also handles scenarios where `ax` does not match `b[j]` or `mx`.***
