The code calculates the maximum value in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, where `sa` is a set created from the list `a` and `sb` is a set created from the variable `b`. If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None, which would prevent the execution of the next line of code.

Since the behavior when the sets are not equal is not specified, we assume `sa` and `sb` are not equal for this case. The maximum value will be computed based on the elements in `sa` that are not in `sb`.

The output state will then reflect the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and the calculated maximum value `mx`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, and `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference sa - sb**.
