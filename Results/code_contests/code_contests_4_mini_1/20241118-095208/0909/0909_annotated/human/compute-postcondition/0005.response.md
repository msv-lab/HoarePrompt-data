According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is a list (or any iterable) that contains at least one element. Additionally, at the end of the last iteration, the variables `i` and `ax` will be set to the index and value of the last element in `a`.

For the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 1 element, and at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0 and `ax` should be the first element in `a`.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are assigned the values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`**
