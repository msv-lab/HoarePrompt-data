Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, and `gaps` contains the value of `gl` if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True; otherwise, `special` remains unchanged. No changes occur to the other variables during this operation.***
