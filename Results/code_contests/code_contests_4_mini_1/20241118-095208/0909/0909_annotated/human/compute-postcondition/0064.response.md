The value of `special` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value, which was either `True` or `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is increased by 1, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` now includes `gl`, `i` is current index plus 1, `ax` is the next element in `a`, `special` is False, `specialgap` remains unchanged, and `gl` is 0.
