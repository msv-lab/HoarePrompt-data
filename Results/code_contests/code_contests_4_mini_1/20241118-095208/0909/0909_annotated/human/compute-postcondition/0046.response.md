Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` contains the value of `gl` if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, in which case `j` is incremented, `specialgap` is updated to `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `special` is set to True if `ax` is equal to `mx`, and `gl` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `gaps` is updated accordingly, and the conditions retain the values and relationships established in the precondition.***
