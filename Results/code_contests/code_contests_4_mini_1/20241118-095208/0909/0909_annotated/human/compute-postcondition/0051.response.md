The code appends the value of `gl` to the list `gaps`. The value of `j` and the condition of `special` do not affect the appending operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `j`, `special`, and `specialgap`, while indicating that `gl` has been added to the list `gaps`.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1; `special` is true or false; `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` or remains unchanged; `gl` is appended to `gaps`.**
