Postcondition: ***`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, and `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns, indicating that a special condition related to gaps was not met. In all other cases, there are no changes to the program state since the function does not explicitly return any value.***
