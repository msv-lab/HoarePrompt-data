The statement `ans += y * g` updates the value of `ans` by adding the product of `y` and `g` to it. The previous values of `ans`, `y`, and `g` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. However, we can state that `ans` is being updated.

The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` has been updated but does not specify the exact values.

Output State: **`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains at least two elements, `g` is the second element in `gaps`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `ans` is updated, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k.**
