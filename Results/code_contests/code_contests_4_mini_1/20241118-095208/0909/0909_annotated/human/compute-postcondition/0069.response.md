To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we first analyze the provided state at the end of the previous iteration and the loop structure.

In the for loop `for (i, ax) in enumerate(a):`, the loop is based on the `a` list. The loop will iterate over the elements of `a`, and `i` is the current index while `ax` is the current element in `a`.

1. The variable `i` is currently the current index plus 1. This means that at the end of the last iteration, `i` has already moved to the next index, which means it is equal to the length of the list `a` if the loop has completed all its iterations.

2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than the length of `a`, meaning we need to ensure that `i` is less than the total number of elements in `a`.

3. Since `i` is currently the index plus 1, to allow for another iteration, we can deduce that the length of `a` must be at least `i + 1`. 

4. The value of `ax` should also reflect the next element in `a`, which can be obtained by noting that it should be the element at index `i` if `i` is still within the bounds of the list.

Considering these points, we need to adjust the following states:

- `i` should be adjusted to the current index which would be equal to the previous `i` (which is the index plus one) minus one.
- `ax` needs to reflect the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is the adjusted current index.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`j`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` includes the updated value of `gl`, `i` is current index, `ax` is the element in `a` at index `i`, and `len(a)` is greater than `i`.**
