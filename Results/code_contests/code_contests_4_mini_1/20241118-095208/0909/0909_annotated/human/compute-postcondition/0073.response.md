Postcondition: ***`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains counts of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, and `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`. If `special` is true, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. If `m` is 0, `gaps` remains an empty list, and `j`, `gl`, and `special` retain their initial values. If `a` contains no elements or all elements do not match `b`, the loop does not execute, leaving `gaps` empty and the other variables unchanged.***
