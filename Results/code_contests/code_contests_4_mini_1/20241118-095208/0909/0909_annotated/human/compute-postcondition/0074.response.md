The code `gaps.append(gl)` adds the current value of `gl` to the `gaps` list. Since the initial state indicates that if `m` is 0, `gaps` remains an empty list and `gl` retains its initial value. This line of code executes, adding `gl` to `gaps`. The values of `j`, `special`, and the contents of `gaps` are updated accordingly, but `j` and `special` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, and `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`.**
