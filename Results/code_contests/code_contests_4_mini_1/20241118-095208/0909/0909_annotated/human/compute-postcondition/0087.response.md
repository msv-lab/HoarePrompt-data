The expression updates the variable `ans` by adding a calculated value based on the current value of `g`, which is the third element of `gaps`. The formula used is `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`. Since `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`, we can deduce that `ans` will be updated with the contributions from both parts of the formula. The values of `j`, `gaps`, `gl`, and `special` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far; `gaps` contains at least 3 elements; `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements; `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`; `ans` is updated; `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`; `g` is the third element of `gaps`.**
