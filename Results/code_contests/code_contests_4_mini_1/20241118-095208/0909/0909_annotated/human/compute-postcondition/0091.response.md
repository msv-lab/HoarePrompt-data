According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `gaps` variable. For the loop to execute, the `gaps` collection must contain at least one element. Since the initial state indicates that `gaps` contains the value of `gl`, we need to ensure that `gaps` is not empty. 

Furthermore, the loop variable `g` will take the values from `gaps`, so we can initialize `g` to the first element of `gaps` if it is not empty.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `gaps` contains at least one element and also set the value of `g` to the first element of `gaps`.

State: **`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains at least one element, `g` is the first element in `gaps`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `ans` is 0, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`**
