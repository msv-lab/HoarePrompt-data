Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is an integer less than `m` and is incremented by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is a boolean indicating the state of special condition, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is set to 0; if `special` is False, there is no assignment to `specialgap`.***
