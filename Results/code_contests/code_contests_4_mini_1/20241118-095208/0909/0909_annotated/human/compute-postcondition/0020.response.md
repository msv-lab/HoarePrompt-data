Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, and `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`. If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns None. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains 0. If `m` is greater than 0 and `a` has fewer than `m` elements, `j` may remain less than `m` if no matches are found, or it may increase if matches are found, but the output remains unaffected until the condition of `j < m` is met. In all cases where `j` is less than `m`, the function returns None.***
