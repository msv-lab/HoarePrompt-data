Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are also values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is an integer that can either remain 0 or increase to 1, `i` remains 0, and `ax` is the first element in `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If not, `j` remains unchanged at 0. This captures the condition where `j` may or may not change based on the comparison of `ax` and `b[j]`, ensuring all edge cases regarding the values of `j`, `m`, and the equality of `ax` and `b[j]` are covered.***
