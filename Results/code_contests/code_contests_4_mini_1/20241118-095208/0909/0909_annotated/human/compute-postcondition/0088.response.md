According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `gaps`. The loop iterates over each element in `gaps`. At the end of the last iteration, `gaps` contains at least 3 elements, and `g` is currently the third element of `gaps`. For the loop to execute one more time, `gaps` must contain at least 4 elements, and `g` should be the fourth element of `gaps`.

State: **`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains at least 4 elements, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `ans` is updated, `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`, `g` is the fourth element of `gaps`**
