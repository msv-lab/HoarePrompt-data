Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is an integer less than `m` and is now incremented by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is True, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`.***
