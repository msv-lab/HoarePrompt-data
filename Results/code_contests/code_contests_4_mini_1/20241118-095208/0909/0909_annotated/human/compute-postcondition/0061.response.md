Postcondition: ***`j` is increased by 1, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is updated based on the value of `gl`, `i` is current index plus 1, `ax` is the next element in `a`, and if `special` is true, `specialgap` is updated based on `gl`. If `special` is false, `specialgap` remains unchanged.***
