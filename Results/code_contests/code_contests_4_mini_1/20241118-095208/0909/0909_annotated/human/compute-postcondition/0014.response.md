Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` (the third element of `a`) is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is equal to or greater than `m`, or if `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` remains unchanged, which can either be 0 or 1. This accounts for all cases where `j` is in the range of valid indices for `b` and the comparison with `ax`.***
