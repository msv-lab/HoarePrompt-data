According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `a` and the value of `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `a` has at least 2 elements, the length of `a` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to become 2, which would allow the loop to access the third element of `a`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be changed to 2 to reflect the next iteration.
- `ax` should be updated to the third element in `a` (i.e., `a[2]`).

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is an integer that can either remain 0 or increase to 1, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the third element in `a`.**
