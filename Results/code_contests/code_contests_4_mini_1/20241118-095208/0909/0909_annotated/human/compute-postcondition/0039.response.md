The value of `gl` is assigned 0, but it is already 0. Thus, the value of `gl` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` now contains `gl`, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `gl` is 0, `special` is a boolean indicating the state of special condition, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`.
