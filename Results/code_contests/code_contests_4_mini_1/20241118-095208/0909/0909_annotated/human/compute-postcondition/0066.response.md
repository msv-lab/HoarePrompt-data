Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is updated based on the value of `gl`, `i` is the current index plus 1, and `ax` is the next element in `a`. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True. In the case where `ax` is not equal to `mx`, the value of `special` remains unchanged.***
