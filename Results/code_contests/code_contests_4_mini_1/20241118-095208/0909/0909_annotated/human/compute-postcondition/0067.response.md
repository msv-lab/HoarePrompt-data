The value of `gl` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `gl` is unknown, therefore the output state reflects that `gl` has been updated. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`j`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is updated based on the value of `gl`, `i` is the current index plus 1, `ax` is the next element in `a`, and `gl` is increased by 1.**
