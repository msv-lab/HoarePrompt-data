The value of `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, but there is no information given about the value of `gl` or the previous value of `j`. The state of `j` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `j` and the assignment of `specialgap`.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`**
