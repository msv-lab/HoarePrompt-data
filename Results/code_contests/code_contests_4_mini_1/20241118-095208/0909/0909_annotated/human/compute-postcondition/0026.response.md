Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `sa` is a set created from the list `a`, and `sb` is a set created from the variable `b`. If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None. If the sets are not equal, there is no specified behavior in the code to handle this case.***
