Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is an integer that can either remain 0 or increase to 1, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element in `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` remains unchanged.***
