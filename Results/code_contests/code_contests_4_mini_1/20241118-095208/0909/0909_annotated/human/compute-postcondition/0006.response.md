Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`, `j` is less than `m`, and the first element of `a` (which is `ax`) is equal to `b[j]`.***
