You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000; x, k, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1,000,000,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n distinct integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; b is a list of m distinct integers where each b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, and `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`. If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns None. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains 0. If `m` is greater than 0 and `a` has fewer than `m` elements, `j` may remain less than `m` if no matches are found, or it may increase if matches are found, but the output remains unaffected until the condition of `j < m` is met. In all cases where `j` is less than `m`, the function returns None.

Case_2: *`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `sa` is a set created from the list `a`, and `sb` is a set created from the variable `b`. If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None. If the sets are not equal, there is no specified behavior in the code to handle this case.

Case_3: *`j` is the number of elements in `b` matched so far, `gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements, and `special` indicates whether the last processed element in `a` was the maximum value from `sa - sb`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns, indicating that a special condition related to gaps was not met. In all other cases, there are no changes to the program state since the function does not explicitly return any value.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
