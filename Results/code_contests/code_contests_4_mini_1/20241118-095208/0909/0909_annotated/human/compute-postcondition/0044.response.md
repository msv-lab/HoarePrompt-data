Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, `special` is set to True if `ax` (the first element of the list `a`) is equal to `mx`. If `ax` is not equal to `mx`, the value of `special` remains False.***
