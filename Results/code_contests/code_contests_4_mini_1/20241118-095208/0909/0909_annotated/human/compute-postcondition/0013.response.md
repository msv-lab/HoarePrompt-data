The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` can either remain 0 or increase to 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `ax`) are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential new value of `j`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` can either be 1 or 2, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the third element in `a`**
