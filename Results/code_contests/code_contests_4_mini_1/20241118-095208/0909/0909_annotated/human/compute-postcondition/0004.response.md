The variable `j` is assigned the value 0, and it does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, or `b`, which were already assigned the values returned by `func_2()`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are assigned the values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, and `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are assigned the values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, and `j` is 0**
