According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `ax` is the first element in `a`, which implies that in the next iteration `i` will be incremented to 1 and `ax` will then be the second element in `a`.

Since `a` is stated to have at least 1 element, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements. The current value of `i` is 0, so it will become 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are also values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is an integer that can either remain 0 or increase to 1, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element in `a`.**
