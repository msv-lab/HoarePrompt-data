Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, and `gaps` is updated based on the value of `gl`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `special` is set to False, and `gaps` has 0 appended to it, while `gl` is reset to 0 and `specialgap` remains unchanged. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True; otherwise, `special` remains unchanged and `gl` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `gl` reflects the count of consecutive values not equal to `b[j]`, and both `gaps` and `specialgap` capture the state of gaps appropriately.***
