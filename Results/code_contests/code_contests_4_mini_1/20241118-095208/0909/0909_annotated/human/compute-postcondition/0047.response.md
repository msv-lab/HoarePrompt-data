To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information.

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over `a` using `enumerate`, where `i` is the index and `ax` is the corresponding element from the list `a`.

2. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - We know that `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `mx` is defined as the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`.
   - `gaps` contains the value of `gl` if certain conditions involving `j` and `ax` are met.
   - The variable `j` is incremented if `j < m` and `ax == b[j]`, otherwise `special` is adjusted based on the equality of `ax` and `mx`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue executing as long as there are elements in the list `a` to iterate over.
   - Since this is an `enumerate` loop, the index `i` will increment with each iteration until it reaches the length of list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `a`.
   - Assuming `a` has a length of `len(a)`, if the loop has completed its last iteration with index `i`, the new state of `i` should be `i + 1`.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` accordingly.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `mx` is the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` contains the value of `gl` if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, in which case `j` is incremented, `specialgap` is updated to `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, `ax` is the next element in list `a`**
