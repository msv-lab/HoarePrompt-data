Output State: **`n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are also values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is an integer that can range from 0 to `m`, depending on how many elements in `a` match the corresponding elements in `b` up to index `j`. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains 0. If `m` is greater than 0 and `a` has fewer than `m` elements, `j` may still remain less than `m` if no matches are found, or it may increase if matches are found. The loop executes for each element in `a`, and `i` varies from 0 to `len(a)-1`, with `ax` representing the current element in `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged, capturing all edge cases regarding the values of `j`, `m`, `a`, and `b`.**
