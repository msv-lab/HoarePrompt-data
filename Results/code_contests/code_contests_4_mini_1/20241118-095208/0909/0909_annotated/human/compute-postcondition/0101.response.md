The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on values returned by the function `func_2()` for the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, and `y`. It also utilizes a list `a` with at least `n` distinct integers and a list `b` which is also returned by `func_2()`. 

The function has multiple return cases as follows:

**Case 1:** If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns `None`. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains 0. If `m` is greater than 0 and `a` has fewer than `m` elements, `j` may remain less than `m` if no matches are found, or it may increase if matches are found, but in all cases where `j` is less than `m`, the function returns `None`.

**Case 2:** If the sets `sa` and `sb` created from the lists `a` and `b` are equal, the function prints 0 and returns `None`. If the sets are not equal, there is no specified behavior in the code to handle this case.

**Case 3:** If a special condition regarding gaps is not met (i.e., if `specialgap` is less than `k`), the function prints -1 and returns, indicating that a special condition related to gaps was not fulfilled. In all other cases, the function does not explicitly return any value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly. It relies on values from `func_2()` for `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, and `y`, and uses a list `a` with at least `n` distinct integers and a list `b` returned from `func_2()`. Based on the values of these variables and conditions, it can print -1 or 0 and return None, but in some cases, it does not have a defined return behavior.**
