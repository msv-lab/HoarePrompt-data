The function accepts no parameters and relies on values returned by `func_2()` for its execution. It performs a series of operations comparing elements from a list `a`, derived from `func_2()`, with another list `b`, also from `func_2()`. It checks for conditions on the counts of matching elements and the equality of sets derived from `a` and `b`. Depending on the results of these checks, it can print -1 or 0 and may return None. If certain conditions related to gaps between matching elements are not met, it also prints -1. The function does not have a defined return behavior in cases where none of the conditions are satisfied, and it relies on side effects (printing) to convey results.
