The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. The other variables (`gaps`, `j`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap`, and `k`) remain unchanged as the print function does not modify their state. Therefore, the output state is that the function prints `-1`, while the values of the other variables remain as they are.

Output State: **`gaps` contains the lengths of segments in `a` that are not interrupted by elements in `b` up to index `j`, `j` is less than `m`, `gl` is the current length of such segments, `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, `gaps` now includes `gl`, and `specialgap` is less than `k`; the function prints -1**
