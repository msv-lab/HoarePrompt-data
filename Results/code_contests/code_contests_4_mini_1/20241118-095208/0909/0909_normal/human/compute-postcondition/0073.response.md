Postcondition: ***`gaps` contains the lengths of segments in `a` that are not interrupted by elements in `b` up to index `j`, `j` is less than `m`, and `gl` is the current length of such segments. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. If `gaps` is empty, which can occur if `a` is empty or has fewer elements than `m`, then `specialgap` remains unchanged, and the values of `j`, `gl`, and `special` remain at their initial values (0, 0, and False respectively).***
