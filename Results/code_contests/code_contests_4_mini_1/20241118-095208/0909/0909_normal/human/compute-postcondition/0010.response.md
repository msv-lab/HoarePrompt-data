The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element of `a`**
