`gl` is assigned the value `0`, while the values of `gaps`, `j`, and `specialgap` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `gl` along with the unchanged states of the other variables. 

Output State: **`gaps` now includes `gl`, `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` remains unchanged, and `gl` is 0**
