The variable `sb` is assigned the value of `set(b)`, which creates a set from the list or iterable `b`. The initial states of `a` and `sa` are not directly affected by this line of code, as it only creates a new set `sb`. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values of `a` and `sa`, along with the new variable `sb` that has been created.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`**
