Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `gaps` may contain 0 if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, in which case `j` is increased by 1 and `gl` is reset to 0. If `special` was True before execution, it retains its value in `specialgap`. If `j` is equal to or greater than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `gl` is incremented by 1, and if `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True; otherwise, `special` remains False. In any case, if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `gaps` will contain the value of `gl` before it is reset.***
