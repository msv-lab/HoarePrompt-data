The code prints the value `0`. There are no changes to the previous values of the variables, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, and the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, and the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal; printed 0**
