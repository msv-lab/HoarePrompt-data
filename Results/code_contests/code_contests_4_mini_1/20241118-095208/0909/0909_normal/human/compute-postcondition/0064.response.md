The variable `special` is assigned the value `False`, and it does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` now includes `gl`, `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` remains unchanged, and `gl` is 0; `special` is False.

Output State: **`gaps` now includes `gl`, `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` remains unchanged, and `gl` is 0; `special` is False**
