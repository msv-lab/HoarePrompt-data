Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `gaps` may contain 0, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `special` is true, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. Otherwise, `specialgap` remains unchanged.***
