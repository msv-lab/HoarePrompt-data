According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list contains at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0, and `ax` will refer to the first element of the list `a`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 element, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `ax` should be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is initialized to 0, `gl` is 0, and `special` is set to False**
