The operation `gaps.append(gl)` adds the value of `gl` to the end of the list `gaps`. The existing values in `gaps` are not specified, but it is mentioned that `gaps` may contain 0. The other variables remain unchanged as the append operation only affects the `gaps` list. Therefore, the output state reflects that `gl` has been added to `gaps`.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `gaps` now contains the value of `gl` appended, and `j` is incremented by 1.**
