Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, and `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`. If `ax` equals `mx`, then `special` is set to True. If `ax` does not equal `mx`, the value of `special` remains unchanged.***
