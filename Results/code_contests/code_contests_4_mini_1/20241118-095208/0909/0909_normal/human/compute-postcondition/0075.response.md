The function `debug_print(gaps)` is executed, which is intended to print or display the contents of the `gaps` variable. The values of `gaps`, `j`, `gl`, and `special` are not altered by this operation. As such, the output state reflects the current state of all relevant variables without any changes. 

Output State: **`gaps` contains the lengths of segments in `a` that are not interrupted by elements in `b` up to index `j`, `j` is less than `m`, `gl` is the current length of such segments, `special` is True, and `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, and `gaps` now includes `gl`.**
