According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will iterate over the elements in `a`, so `a` must be a list or a collection with at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute. At the start of the loop, the index `i` will be 0, and `ax` will be assigned the first element of `a` if it exists. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 1 element, and the initial values of `i` and `ax` should be set accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer assigned from `func_2()`, `m` is an integer assigned from `func_2()`, `x` is assigned from the return values of `func_2()`, `k` is assigned from the return values of `func_2()`, `y` is assigned from the return values of `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`**
