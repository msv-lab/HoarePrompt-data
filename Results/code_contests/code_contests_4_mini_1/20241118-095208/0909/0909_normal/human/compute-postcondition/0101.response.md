The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers, and `a` is a list of distinct integers. The constraints specify that `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 200,000\); `x`, `k`, and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\); and `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and `b` is a list containing `m` distinct integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq n\).

After executing the function body, the output is determined by the following cases:

**Case 1:** If `j` (which is presumably incremented in the function but not explicitly defined in the description) is less than `m`, the function prints `-1` and returns `None`. If `j` equals `m`, there is no output or return value from this block. If `a` is empty or `m` is 0, the function also prints `-1` and returns `None`.

**Case 2:** If sets created from `a` and `b` (denoted as `sa` and `sb`, respectively) are equal, the function prints `0` and returns `None`. If they are not equal, there is no output or return value from this block.

**Case 3:** If certain conditions regarding `gaps` (which measures segments in `a` not interrupted by elements in `b`), and a variable `specialgap` (defined in the context of the function) are met, and if `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints `-1` and returns without any other output. Otherwise, the function continues executing.

In summary, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, and `b`, and based on the conditions related to the values of `j`, the contents of lists `a` and `b`, and the derived segments, it may print `-1`, `0`, or continue execution without returning any value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, a list `a`, and a list `b`, and may print `-1` or `0` based on specific conditions related to the values of `j`, the equality of sets created from `a` and `b`, and the lengths of segments in `a` not interrupted by `b`.**
