Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers. `j` is an integer that is less than `m`, and `a` is a list with at least `m` elements if `j` reaches `m`. The value of `j` counts how many elements in `a` match the corresponding elements in `b`, and `j` is less than `m`. If `a` is an empty list or if `m` is 0, `j` remains 0. The variable `i` iterates from 0 to `len(a) - 1` within the loop.***
