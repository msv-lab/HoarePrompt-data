Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers assigned from the return values of `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least `m` elements if `j` reaches `m`, `j` is an integer that counts how many elements in `a` match the corresponding elements in `b` while `j` is less than `m`. If `a` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `j` remains 0. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute and `j` remains 0. If `j` reaches `m`, the loop exits, and `j` will equal `m`. The variable `i` will iterate from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.**
