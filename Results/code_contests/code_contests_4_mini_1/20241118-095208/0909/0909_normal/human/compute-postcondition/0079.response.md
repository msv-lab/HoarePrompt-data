Postcondition: ***`gaps` contains the lengths of segments in `a` that are not interrupted by elements in `b` up to index `j`, `j` is less than `m`, `gl` is the current length of such segments, `special` is True, and `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` which is now included in `gaps`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns without any other output. Otherwise, the function continues its execution beyond this point.***
