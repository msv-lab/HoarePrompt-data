The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is an integer and is less than `m`, it can take on a new value that is one greater than its previous value. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is now increased by 1, `gl` is 0, and `special` is set to False.
