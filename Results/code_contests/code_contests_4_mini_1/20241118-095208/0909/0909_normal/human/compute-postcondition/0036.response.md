The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is currently 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is True, and `specialgap` is 0.
