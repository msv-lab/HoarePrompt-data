Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, and `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `gaps` includes the value of `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True, and `gl` is incremented by 1. This means that `special` may remain unchanged if the first condition is not satisfied, allowing for the possibility of distinguishing between special and non-special cases based on the values of `ax` and `mx`.***
