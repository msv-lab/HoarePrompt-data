The value of `gl` is assigned 0. The initial state does not change any other variables, and since `gl` is being initialized, it directly impacts its own value. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `gl` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `gaps` now contains the value of `gl` appended, `j` is incremented by 1, and `gl` is 0**
