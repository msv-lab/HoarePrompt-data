Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `j` is an integer, and `i` is 2. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` (the third element of `a`) is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` remains unchanged.***
