In the given code snippet, `gaps.append(gl)` appends the value of `gl` to the list `gaps`. The initial state mentions that if `special` is true, `j` is increased by 1 and `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. If `special` is false, `j` is still increased by 1, but `specialgap` remains unchanged. 

However, the operation of appending to the list `gaps` does not affect the values of `j` or `specialgap`. The state of `gaps` changes to include `gl`, but no other variables are impacted.

Output State: **`gaps` now includes `gl`, `j` is increased by 1, and `specialgap` remains unchanged.**
