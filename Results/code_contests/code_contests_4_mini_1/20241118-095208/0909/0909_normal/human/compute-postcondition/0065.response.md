The variable `special` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`a`, `i`, `ax`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`). Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `special` is True.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `special` is True**
