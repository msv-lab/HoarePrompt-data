Functionality: ** The function accepts parameters that are derived from the return values of `func_2()`, including integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and lists `a` and `b`. It checks if the number of matching elements in `a` and `b` is less than `m`, and if so, it prints -1. It also checks if the unique elements in `a` and `b` are equal, printing 0 if they are. The function calculates gaps in `a` that are not interrupted by elements in `b` and evaluates these gaps based on conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `k`. Finally, it prints the calculated result. The function does not return any values directly but may print results based on specific conditions.**
