Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers, and `a` is a list with at least `m` elements if `j` reaches `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `j` equals `m`, the function does not execute the if statement, and the program continues without any output or return value from this block. If either `a` is empty or `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `j` at 0, which also results in -1 being printed and returning None. Overall, if `j < m`, the output is -1, otherwise, there is no output or return.***
