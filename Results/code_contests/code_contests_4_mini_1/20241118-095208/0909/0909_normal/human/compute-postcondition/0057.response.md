Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element in the list `a`, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, and `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `gaps` contains the value of `gl` appended, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. Otherwise, if `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True, and `gl` is incremented by 1; in the case where `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` does not equal `b[j]`, `special` remains unchanged. Thus, the state of `gaps`, `j`, `gl`, and `special` reflects the conditions evaluated in the if statement.***
