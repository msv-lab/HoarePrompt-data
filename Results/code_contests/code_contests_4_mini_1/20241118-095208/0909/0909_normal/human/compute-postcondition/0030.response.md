The variable `gl` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any other variables, as the previous values of `a`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `gaps`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is initialized to 0, and `gl` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is initialized to 0, and `gl` is 0**.
