The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `b`, `a`, `i`, `ax`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers assigned from the return values of `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`, and the first element of `a` is equal to `b[j-1]`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers assigned from the return values of `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`, and the first element of `a` is equal to `b[0]`.**
