The variable `gaps` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The initial states of the other variables (`a`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `gaps` is an empty list.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`, and `gaps` is an empty list**
