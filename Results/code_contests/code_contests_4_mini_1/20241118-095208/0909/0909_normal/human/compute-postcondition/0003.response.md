The value of `b` is assigned the result of `func_2()`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `a` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `b` is now the return value of `func_2()`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned from `func_2()`, `m` is an integer assigned from `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are assigned from the return values of `func_2()`, `a` is assigned from the return value of `func_2()`, and `b` is the return value of `func_2()`**
