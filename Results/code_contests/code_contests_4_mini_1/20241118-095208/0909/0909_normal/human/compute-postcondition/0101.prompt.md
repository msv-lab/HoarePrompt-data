You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000; x, k, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; b is a list of m distinct integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers, and `a` is a list with at least `m` elements if `j` reaches `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `j` equals `m`, the function does not execute the if statement, and the program continues without any output or return value from this block. If either `a` is empty or `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `j` at 0, which also results in -1 being printed and returning None. Overall, if `j < m`, the output is -1, otherwise, there is no output or return.

Case_2: *`a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, and `sb` is a set created from `b`. If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None; otherwise, there is no output or return value.

Case_3: *`gaps` contains the lengths of segments in `a` that are not interrupted by elements in `b` up to index `j`, `j` is less than `m`, `gl` is the current length of such segments, `special` is True, and `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` which is now included in `gaps`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns without any other output. Otherwise, the function continues its execution beyond this point.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
