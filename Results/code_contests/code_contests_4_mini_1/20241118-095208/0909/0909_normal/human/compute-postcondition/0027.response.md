The value of `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the set difference `sa - sb`. This means that it calculates the elements that are in `sa` but not in `sb`. If `sa` and `sb` are equal, the difference would be an empty set, which would lead to an error when trying to find the maximum. However, since the initial state does not specify whether `sa` and `sb` are equal, we can assume that they are not equal, allowing the execution of the code.

The state of `a`, `sa`, and `sb` is not directly affected by this operation, but we will note the calculated maximum value. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `a`, `sa`, `sb`, and the newly calculated `mx`.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `sa` is a set created from `a`, `sb` is a set created from `b`, and `mx` is the maximum value from `sa - sb`**.
