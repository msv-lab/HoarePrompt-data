Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are integers assigned from the return values of `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is an integer that is incremented by 1 if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` (the first element of `a`) is equal to `b[j]`. If these conditions are not met, `j` remains unchanged. The variable `i` remains 0 throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
