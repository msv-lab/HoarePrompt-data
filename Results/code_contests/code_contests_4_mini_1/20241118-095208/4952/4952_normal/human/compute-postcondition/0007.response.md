The code `ns += s[i]` adds the value of `s[i]` to `ns`. Since `i` is defined and greater than or equal to 0, the value of `s[i]` is valid and will be added to `ns`. The previous value of `ns` is unknown, but it will now be incremented by the value of `s[i]`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is defined and greater than or equal to 0; `ns` is increased by `s[i]`**
