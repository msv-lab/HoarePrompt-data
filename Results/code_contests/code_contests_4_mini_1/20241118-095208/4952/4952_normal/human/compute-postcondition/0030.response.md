The function `func` does not have any parameters defined in the provided signature. However, it is stated that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. 

Given that the function processes these inputs, it is implied that it operates on `n` and `s` without explicitly accepting them as parameters in the function signature. The output of the function is not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, without further details about the specific output of the function, I will summarize the accepted input types and their constraints based on the information given.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, but it does not explicitly take these as parameters in the function definition. The specific return value is not provided.**
