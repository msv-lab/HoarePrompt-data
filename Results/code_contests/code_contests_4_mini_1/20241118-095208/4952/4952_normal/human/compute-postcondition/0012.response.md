According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is defined and is greater than or equal to 0, which means it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute again. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is defined and is greater than or equal to 0; `ns` is updated by adding `s[i]`**
