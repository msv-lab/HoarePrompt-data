According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 2, and `n` is greater than `i + 2`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, which is already satisfied.

Since `n` is greater than `i + 2`, it implies that `n` must also be greater than `i`, ensuring that the loop can continue executing. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`ns` is updated by adding `s[i]`, `i` is increased by 2, and `n` is greater than `i + 2`**
