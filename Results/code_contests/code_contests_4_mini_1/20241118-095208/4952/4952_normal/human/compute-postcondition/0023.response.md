The value of `i` is increased by 2. The state of `ns` is updated by adding `s[i]`, but since we don't have the specific current value of `i` or the content of `s`, we cannot specify the new value of `ns`. However, `n` is confirmed to be greater than `i + 2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `i` and the conditions on `n`.

Output State: **`ns` is updated by adding `s[i]`, `i` is increased by 2, and `n` is greater than `i + 2**.
