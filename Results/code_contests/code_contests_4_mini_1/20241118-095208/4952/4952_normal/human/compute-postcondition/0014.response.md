Postcondition: ***`i` is properly initialized and greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer that is odd, `s` is a string, and `ns` contains characters from `s` at indices starting from `i` and decrementing by 2 each iteration until `i` is less than 0. If `n` is an empty string or if `s` is empty, `ns` will remain empty.***
