Output State: **`if n is an odd integer and s is not empty then ns` is a string constructed from characters at odd indices of `s`, `i` is equal to `n`. If n is an even integer and s is not empty then ns is a string constructed from characters at even indices of `s`, `i` is equal to `n`. If s is empty, `ns` will remain empty and `i` will be equal to 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `n`. If `i` is not properly initialized, a type mismatch error occurs. The loop will not execute if `i` is not less than `n` initially.**
