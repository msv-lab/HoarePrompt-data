The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is increased by 2, the previous value of `i` is unknown, but it will now be increased by 2. The values of `ns` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `i`.

Output State: **`ns` is updated by adding `s[i]`, `i` is increased by 2, and `n` is greater than `i + 2**
