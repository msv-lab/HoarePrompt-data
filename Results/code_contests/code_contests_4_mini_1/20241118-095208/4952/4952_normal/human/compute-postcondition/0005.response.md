The code attempts to decrement the variable `i` by 2. However, since `i` is not defined in the initial state, a type mismatch error occurs. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `ns`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state indicates that an error has occurred due to the undefined variable `i`.

Output State: **An error occurs due to type mismatch because `i` is not defined.**
