According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is defined and greater than or equal to 0, and it has been decreased by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be at least 0 after the decrement. This means that before the decrement, `i` must have been at least 2. 

So for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is greater than or equal to 0 after being decreased by 2. 

State: **`i` is defined and `i` is greater than or equal to 2**
