The value of `i` is decremented by 2, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, only that it is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `i`. The state of `ns` remains the same, as it is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`i` is defined and greater than or equal to 0; `i` is decreased by 2**
