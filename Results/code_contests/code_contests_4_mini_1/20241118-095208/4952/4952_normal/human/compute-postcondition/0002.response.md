The variable `ns` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous values of `n` (a string input) and `s` (a list of characters from the string input) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now a string input, `s` is a list of characters from the string input, and `ns` is an empty string.

Output State: **`n` is now a string input, `s` is a list of characters from the string input, and `ns` is an empty string**
