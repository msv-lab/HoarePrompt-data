According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has increased by 2, but we do not have the specific values of `i` and `n`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n`. Since `ns` remains unchanged and we know that `i` has increased by 2, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than `i` after this increment.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`ns` remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 2, and `n` is greater than `i + 2`**
