Postcondition: ***If `n` is an odd integer, then `i` is set to 0, and `ns` will contain characters from `s` starting at index 0 and decrementing by 2 until `i` becomes less than 0. If `n` is an even integer, then `i` is set to 1, and `ns` will contain characters from `s` starting at index 1 and decrementing by 2 until `i` becomes less than 0. In either case, if `s` is an empty string, `ns` will remain empty. Additionally, if `i` is not properly initialized, a type mismatch error occurs.***
