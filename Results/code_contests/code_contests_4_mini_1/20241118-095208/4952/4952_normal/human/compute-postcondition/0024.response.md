According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 2 and `n` is greater than `i + 2`. 

Since `n` is greater than `i + 2`, it implies that `n` is at least `i + 3`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. In this case, `n` does not need adjustment, but we need to ensure that the relationship holds true. 

Thus, the state remains valid as it ensures that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`ns` is updated by adding `s[i]`, `i` is increased by 2, and `n` is greater than `i + 2`**
