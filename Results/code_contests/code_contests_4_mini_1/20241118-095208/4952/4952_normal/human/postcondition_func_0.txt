The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from input, where `n` is expected to be the length of `s`. It constructs a new string `ns` by appending characters from `s` based on the parity of `n`. If `n` is odd, it appends characters from even indices of `s`; if `n` is even, it appends characters from odd indices. The function then prints the resulting string `ns`. It does not handle cases where `n` and `s` are not properly defined, potentially leading to errors.
