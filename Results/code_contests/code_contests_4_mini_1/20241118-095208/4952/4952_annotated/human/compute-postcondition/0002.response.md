`ns` is assigned an empty string. The initial state of `n` and `s` is unchanged by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` is an empty string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` is an empty string**
