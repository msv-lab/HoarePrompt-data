The value of `i` is decremented by 2. Given that `i` is `n - 6`, the new value of `i` will be `(n - 6) - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 8`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `ns` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` contains `s[n - 2]`, `s[n - 4]`, and `s[n - 6]`; `i` is `n - 8`**
