Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It constructs a new string `ns` by first appending characters from `s` at even indices starting from `n-2` down to 0, and then appending characters from `s` at odd indices starting from either 0 (if `n` is odd) or 1 (if `n` is even) up to `n-1`. The resulting string `ns` is printed. If `n` is less than 2, `ns` remains an empty string and is printed as such.**
