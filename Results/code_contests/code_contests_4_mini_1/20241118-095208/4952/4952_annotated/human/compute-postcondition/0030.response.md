The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters in the function definition provided. However, based on the constraints mentioned, it is implied that the function operates on two inputs: `n` and `s`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2000 \).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters.

Since the output behavior is not specified in the given information, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior of the function without additional details. 

Therefore, based on the parameters described:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters. The return value and specific functionality are not defined in the provided output information.**
