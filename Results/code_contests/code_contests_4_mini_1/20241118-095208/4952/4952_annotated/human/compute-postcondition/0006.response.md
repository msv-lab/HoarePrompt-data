According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 4`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 0, which means `n - 4` must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, it is valid for `n` to be greater than or equal to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` contains the character `s[n - 2]`; `i` is now `n - 4`**
