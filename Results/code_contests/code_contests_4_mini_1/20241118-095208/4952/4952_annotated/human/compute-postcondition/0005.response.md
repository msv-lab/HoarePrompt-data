The value of `i` is decremented by 2. Since `i` was previously assigned the value `n - 2`, after execution, `i` will now be `n - 4`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` contains the character `s[n - 2]`; `i` is now `n - 4`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` contains the character `s[n - 2]`; `i` is now `n - 4**
