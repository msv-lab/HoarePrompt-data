The variable `ns` is increased by the value of `s[i]`, where `i` can be either 4 or 5. The exact impact on `ns` depends on the value of `s[i]`, which is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numeric value for `ns`. The other variables are not affected. 

The output state is: `n` is greater than 5; `i` is either 4 or 5; `ns` is increased by `s[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 5; `i` is either 4 or 5; `ns` is increased by `s[i]`**
