Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer. If `n` is odd, then `i` is set to 0; if `n` is even, then `i` is set to 1. In both cases, if `n` is at least 2, `ns` contains characters from `s` at indices `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., until the maximum index accessed is `n-2 - 2k`, where `k` is the number of iterations. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `ns` remains an empty string, and `i` is still `n - 2`.***
