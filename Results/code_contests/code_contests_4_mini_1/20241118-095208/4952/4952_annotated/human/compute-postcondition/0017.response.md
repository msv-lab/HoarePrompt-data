The variable `i` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state mentions that `i` starts off with a value derived from the condition involving `n`, but this specific assignment directly changes `i` from its previous value (which was `n - 2`). Other variables `n` and `ns` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer, `ns` is a string containing characters from `s` at indices n-2, n-4, ..., until `i` becomes negative, where `i` is 1**
