To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the variables `i` and `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is `i < n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `n` is an integer. 

1. If `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 
2. If `i` is 3, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

Since we do not have a specific value for `n` and it is described only as an integer, we cannot confidently say whether `n` needs to be adjusted. 

Therefore, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `n` is greater than either 2 or 3, depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` can be 2 or 3, to be safe, we should adjust `n` to be greater than 3 to ensure the loop executes regardless of whether `i` is 2 or 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is either 2 or 3, `ns` remains unchanged**
