To analyze the code snippet provided, we start with the initial state where `n` is a positive integer between 6 and 2000. The variable `s` is a list of characters derived from an input string. The variable `ns` currently contains the characters `s[n - 2]` and `s[n - 4]`, and `i` is computed as `n - 6`.

The operation `ns += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of list `s` to list `ns`.

1. The current indices involved:
   - `i` is `n - 6`.
   - The character `s[i]` is now accessed, which is `s[n - 6]`.

2. The initial contents of `ns` are `s[n - 2]` and `s[n - 4]`. After executing `ns += s[i]`, we are adding the character from `s[n - 6]` to `ns`.

3. The output state reflects the updated contents of `ns` and confirms that the character has been appended.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` contains `s[n - 2]`, `s[n - 4]`, and `s[n - 6]`; `i` is `n - 6`**
