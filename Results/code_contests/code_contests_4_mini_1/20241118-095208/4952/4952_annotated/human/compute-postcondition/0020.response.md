The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `i` is either 0 or 1 based on whether `n` is odd or even. Therefore, after executing `i += 2`, `i` will be 2 or 3, respectively. The states of `n` and `ns` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `i` is either 2 or 3; `ns` remains unchanged.**
