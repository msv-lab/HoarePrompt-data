The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` is either 4 or 5, after incrementing, `i` can be 6 or 7. The values of `n` and `ns` remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 5; `i` is either 6 or 7; `ns` is increased by `s[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 5; `i` is either 6 or 7; `ns` is increased by `s[i]`**
