Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ns` is a string containing characters from `s` at indices `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., until the maximum index accessed is `n-2 - 2k` for some integer `k`, where `k` is the number of iterations. Additionally, `n` is odd, meaning `n % 2` is true. If the loop executed, `i` is less than 0, otherwise `i` is equal to `n - 2`.***
