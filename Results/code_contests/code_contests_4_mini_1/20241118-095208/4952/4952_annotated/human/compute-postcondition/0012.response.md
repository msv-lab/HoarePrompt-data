According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 8`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 6 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, the smallest value `n` can take is 6, which means the maximum possible value for `i` at that point is `n - 8 = 6 - 8 = -2`. In this case, since `i` is `n - 8`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be adjusted so that `i` is at least 0, which means `n` must be at least 8.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 8 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` contains `s[n - 2]`, `s[n - 4]`, and `s[n - 6]`; `i` is `n - 8`**
