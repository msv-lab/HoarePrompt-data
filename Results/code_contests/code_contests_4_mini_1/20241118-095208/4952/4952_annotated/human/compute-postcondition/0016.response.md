Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer, `ns` is a string containing characters from `s` at indices n-2, n-4, ..., until `i` becomes negative, where `i` is less than or equal to n-2, and the maximum index accessed is n-2 - 2k (for some integer k), with `k` being the number of iterations. If `n` is less than 2, `ns` remains an empty string and `i` is still n - 2.***
