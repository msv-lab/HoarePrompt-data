The value of `i` is assigned the value of `n - 2`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, the value of `i` will be between -1 and 1998. The variables `s` and `ns` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` is an empty string; `i` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ns` is an empty string; `i` is `n - 2**
