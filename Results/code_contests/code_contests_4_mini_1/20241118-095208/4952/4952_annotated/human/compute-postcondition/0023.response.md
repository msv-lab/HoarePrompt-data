The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` can be either 2 or 3, after the execution, `i` will be either 4 or 5. The values of `n` and `ns` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3; `i` is either 4 or 5; `ns` is increased by `s[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3; `i` is either 4 or 5; `ns` is increased by `s[i]`**
