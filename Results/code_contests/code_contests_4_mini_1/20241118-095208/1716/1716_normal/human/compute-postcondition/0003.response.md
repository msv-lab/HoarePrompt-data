The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Its only action is to print the string 'Impossible' to the console and then terminate the program with an exit status of 0. There are no additional computations, return values, or logical conditions present in the code. The annotations incorrectly suggest that the function accepts parameters and has specific constraints; however, this is not reflected in the actual implementation. 

Functionality: ** The function prints 'Impossible' to the console and exits the program without returning any values or accepting parameters. **
