The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Impossible'. The values of `n` and any other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `n` along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the output is 'Impossible'**
