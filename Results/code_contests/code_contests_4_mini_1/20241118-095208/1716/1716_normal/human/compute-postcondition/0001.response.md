The code `exit(0)` is called, which causes the program to terminate immediately with a status code of 0. This means that the program will stop execution and will not return to any previous state or variables. The values of the variables do not change, but the program ends. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the program terminates with exit code 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the program terminates with exit code 0**
