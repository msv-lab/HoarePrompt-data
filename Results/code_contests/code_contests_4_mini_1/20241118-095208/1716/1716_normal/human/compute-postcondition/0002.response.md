The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \). Additionally, the function works with a collection of names, where each name is a string composed of lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 100 characters. All names are distinct. However, the output of the function is not specified in the provided information.

Given the lack of specific output details, I cannot define the exact return values or conditions like in previous examples. Based on the constraints provided, the functionality of the function can be tentatively stated.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a collection of distinct names, each being a string of lowercase Latin letters (1 to 100 characters long). The specific output or return value is not defined in the provided information.**
