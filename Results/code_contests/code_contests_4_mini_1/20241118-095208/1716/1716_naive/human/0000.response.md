To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program processes the input and whether it handles all potential edge cases as described.

The program is intended to determine if there exists a valid order of letters such that the given names are sorted lexicographically according to that order. The program builds a directed graph of character dependencies based on the comparisons of adjacent names.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The first input is the number of names, followed by the names themselves. The program uses `raw_input()` and `xrange()`, which suggests it is written for Python 2. This is fine as long as we assume the environment supports it.

2. **Building Character Dependencies**: The program initializes a dictionary `before` where each character points to a set of characters that should come before it. It then iterates through pairs of names to compare them character by character and deduce the relationships.

3. **Cycle Detection**: The program checks for cycles in the dependencies. If a cycle is detected (i.e., if a character's dependency leads back to itself), it outputs "Impossible".

4. **Output Construction**: After constructing the dependencies, the program attempts to create a valid order by repeatedly selecting characters with no dependencies, which is a standard topological sorting technique.

### Potential Issues:

- The program doesn't handle the case where there are names that are prefixes of each other correctly. For instance, if we have names like `abc` and `ab`, the program should output "Impossible" since `abc` cannot come before `ab` in any order.
  
- The logic for checking if the relative order is maintained is based solely on the first differing character. If two names are the same up to the length of the shorter one, the longer name should not come before the shorter one.

### Example Input:
For example, consider the input:
```
3
abc
ab
```
The expected output should be "Impossible" because `abc` cannot appear before `ab` regardless of the character order.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle cases where one name is a prefix of another, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
