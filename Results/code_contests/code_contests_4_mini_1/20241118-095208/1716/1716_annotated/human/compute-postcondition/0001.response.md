The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change since the program exits before any further execution. Therefore, the output state indicates that the function prints 'Impossible' and the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each name is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length between 1 and 100, consisting of distinct names; the function prints 'Impossible' and the program exits.**
