The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). Additionally, it accepts a list of names, where each name is a string composed of lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 100. Each name in the list is distinct. The function's output specifics were not provided, so we cannot detail the return values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of distinct names, each being a string of lowercase Latin letters. However, without information on the output, we cannot determine what the function returns. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of distinct names (strings of lowercase Latin letters, length between 1 and 100).**
