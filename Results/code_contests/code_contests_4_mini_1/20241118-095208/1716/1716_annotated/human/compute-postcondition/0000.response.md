The `print` statement outputs the string 'Impossible'. The values of `n` and any names are not changed or affected by this operation, as it only produces output. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and names along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each name is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length between 1 and 100, consisting of distinct names; the function prints 'Impossible'.**
