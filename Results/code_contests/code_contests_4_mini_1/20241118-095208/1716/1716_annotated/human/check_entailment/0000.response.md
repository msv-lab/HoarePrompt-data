The provided annotated program consists of a single function `func_1()` that prints "Impossible" and exits the program. 

The problem description requires a program to determine if an order of letters can be established such that the given names are sorted in a lexicographical order. It is expected to output a possible letter order or "Impossible" if no such order can be determined from the input names.

The program, as it stands, does not implement any logic to analyze the input names and determine the correct order of letters. Instead, it merely outputs "Impossible" without considering the names provided. 

### Potential Case:
If we consider an input such as:
```
3
abc
acb
```
In this case, there exists an order of letters that would make the names "abc" and "acb" lexicographically sorted, for example, considering 'a' < 'c' < 'b'. However, the program would incorrectly output "Impossible" because it does not analyze the names at all.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, as it does not provide any valid logic to determine a possible letter order or check if the names are sorted according to any potential order. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
