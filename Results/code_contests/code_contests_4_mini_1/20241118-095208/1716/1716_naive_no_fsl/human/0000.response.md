Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to determine if there exists a lexicographical order of characters such that a list of names is sorted according to that order. However, there are issues with the implementation that can lead to incorrect results.

One potential problem is in the handling of the case where one name is a prefix of another name. The current logic does not correctly handle this case. For example, consider the input:

```
2
abc
ab
```

In this case, "abc" is a prefix of "ab", but the expected behavior should be that "ab" comes before "abc" when considering lexicographical ordering. According to the problem description, if one name is a prefix of another, the shorter name should come first. However, the logic in the program does not account for this correctly, which can lead to an "Impossible" output even when it is possible to create a valid order.

Additionally, the way the program builds the order of characters and checks for cycles in the character dependencies may not cover all edge cases properly, leading to situations where it incorrectly decides that a valid order is impossible.

Thus, due to these flaws in handling prefixes and possible cycle detection, the program is incorrect for some inputs.
