An endpoint of the hour hand and an endpoint of the minute hand are fixed at the same point, around which each hand rotates clockwise at constant angular velocity. It takes the hour and minute hands 12 hours and 1 hour to make one full rotation, respectively.

At 0 o'clock, the two hands overlap each other. H hours and M minutes later, what is the distance in centimeters between the unfixed endpoints of the hands?

2045,code_contests,human,gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"You are playing the game ""Arranging The Sheep"". The goal of this game is to make the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one square to the right, if the corresponding square exists and is empty. The game ends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty cells between any sheep.

For example, if n=6 and the level is described by the string ""**.*.."", then the following game scenario is possible: 

  * the sheep at the 4 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ""**..*.""; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ""*.*.*.""; 
  * the sheep at the 1 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "".**.*.""; 
  * the sheep at the 3 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "".*.**.""; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ""..***.""; 
  * the sheep are lined up and the game ends. 



For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

The second line of each test case contains a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep) — the description of the level.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case output the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

4043,code_contests,human,gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Arkady needs your help again! This time he decided to build his own high-speed Internet exchange point. It should consist of n nodes connected with minimum possible number of wires into one network (a wire directly connects two nodes). Exactly k of the nodes should be exit-nodes, that means that each of them should be connected to exactly one other node of the network, while all other nodes should be connected to at least two nodes in order to increase the system stability.

Arkady wants to make the system as fast as possible, so he wants to minimize the maximum distance between two exit-nodes. The distance between two nodes is the number of wires a package needs to go through between those two nodes.

Help Arkady to find such a way to build the network that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is as small as possible.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes.

Note that it is always possible to build at least one network with n nodes and k exit-nodes within the given constraints.

Output

In the first line print the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes. In each of the next n - 1 lines print two integers: the ids of the nodes connected by a wire. The description of each wire should be printed exactly once. You can print wires and wires' ends in arbitrary order. The nodes should be numbered from 1 to n. Exit-nodes can have any ids.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
