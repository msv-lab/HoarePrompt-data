Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in the way it reads input. It uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3; instead, it should be using `input()`. This will cause a `NameError` when executed in Python 3.

Furthermore, there is a potential issue with how the program handles the input values. The current implementation does not check if the number of lengths provided matches the value of N. If the user inputs fewer or more lengths than specified by N, the program will still attempt to process the data, leading to incorrect results or errors.

For example:
- If the input is:
```
4
3 8 4
```
The program would expect 4 lengths but only receives 3, which would lead to a misleading calculation.

Thus, due to the incorrect handling of input, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
