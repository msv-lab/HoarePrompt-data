To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the implementation against the problem description.

The problem states that an N-sided polygon can be drawn if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides.

The program reads the number of sides, `N`, and then takes a list of side lengths. It calculates the maximum length (`maxL`) and then computes the sum of all lengths, subtracting the maximum length to get the sum of the other sides. Finally, it checks if `maxL` is less than this sum.

Now, let's evaluate the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads `N` and the list of lengths.
2. **Finding the Maximum Length**: The line `maxL = max(listL)` correctly finds the longest side.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The program sums all lengths and then subtracts the maximum length. 
4. **Condition Check**: The condition `if maxL < sum:` correctly checks if the longest side is less than the sum of the other sides.

However, there is an issue with the input handling. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3; it should be `input()`. If the code is run in Python 3 (which is the current standard), it will raise an error due to the use of `raw_input()`, thus leading to a failure in execution for any input.

Additionally, let's consider a potential edge case:
- If the input is `3` and the sides are `1 2 3`, the program would incorrectly output "Yes" because the longest side (3) is not strictly less than the sum of the other sides (1 + 2 = 3).

Given that the program does not handle inputs correctly in Python 3 and can produce an incorrect result for certain inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
