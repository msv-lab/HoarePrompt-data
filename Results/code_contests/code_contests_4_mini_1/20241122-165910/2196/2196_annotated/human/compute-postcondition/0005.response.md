The `sum` variable is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]` to it. The initial values indicate that `listL` is a non-empty list of integers, and `i` is 0, which means we are accessing the first element of `listL`. The exact value of `listL[i]` is not specified, but `sum` is initially 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `sum` becomes the value of `listL[0]`. The states of other variables (`N`, `i`, `listL`, and `maxL`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 0, `listL` is a non-empty list of integers, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, `sum` is the value of `listL[0]**.
