According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should become 1. The value of `N` does not need to change since it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 1, `listL` is a non-empty list of integers, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, `sum` is the value of `listL[0]**
