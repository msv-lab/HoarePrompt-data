The value of `sum` is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]` to it. The initial value of `sum` is `listL[0]`, and `i` is 1, so the updated value of `sum` will be `listL[0] + listL[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 1, `listL` is a non-empty list of integers, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, and `sum` is updated to `listL[0] + listL[1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 1, `listL` is a non-empty list of integers, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, and `sum` is `listL[0] + listL[1]`**
