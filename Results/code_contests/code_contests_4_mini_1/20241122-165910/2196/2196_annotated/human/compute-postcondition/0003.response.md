The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`N`, `listL`, and `maxL`). Therefore, the output state remains as it was with the addition of `sum`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers created from input values; `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`; `sum` is 0**
