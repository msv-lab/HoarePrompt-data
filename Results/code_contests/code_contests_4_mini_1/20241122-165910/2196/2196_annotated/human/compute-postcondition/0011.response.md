Output State: **`sum` is the sum of the first `N` elements of `listL`. `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list of integers with at least `N` elements, and `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`. If `listL` has fewer than `N` elements, the loop does not execute, and `sum` remains 0.**
