The variable `maxL` is assigned the value of the maximum element from the list `listL`. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, and `listL` is a list of integers derived from input values. The specific values in `listL` are not provided, but the function will determine the maximum integer from that list. Therefore, the output state will reflect the maximum value found in `listL` without changing other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers created from input values; `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`.**
