The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'No'. The variables `sum`, `maxL`, and `N` are not affected by this operation; their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables along with the printed message.

Output State: **`sum` is updated to `sum - maxL`, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, and the printed message is 'No'**
