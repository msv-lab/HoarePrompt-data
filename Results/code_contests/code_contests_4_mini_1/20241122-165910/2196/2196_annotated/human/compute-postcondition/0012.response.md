The value of `sum` is decreased by `maxL`, which is the maximum value in `listL`. The previous value of `sum` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `sum`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `sum` is updated to `sum - maxL`, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10.

Output State: **`sum` is updated to `sum - maxL`, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10**
