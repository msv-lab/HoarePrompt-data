The `print('Yes')` statement outputs the string 'Yes' to the console. The values of the variables `sum`, `maxL`, and `N` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed message.

Output State: **`sum` is updated to `sum - maxL`, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, and 'Yes' is printed.**
