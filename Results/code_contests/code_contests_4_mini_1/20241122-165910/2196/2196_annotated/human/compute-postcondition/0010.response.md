According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be at least 3 (which it is), and `i` must be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented to 3.
- `N` remains the same since it satisfies the condition.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 3, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, and `sum` is the previous value of `sum + listL[2]**
