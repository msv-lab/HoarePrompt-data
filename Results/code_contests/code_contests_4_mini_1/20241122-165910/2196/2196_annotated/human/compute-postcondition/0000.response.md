The variable `N` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The constraints specify that `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, but the exact value of `N` is not provided in the initial state. Other variables (`L_1`, `L_2`, ..., `L_N`) remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10**
