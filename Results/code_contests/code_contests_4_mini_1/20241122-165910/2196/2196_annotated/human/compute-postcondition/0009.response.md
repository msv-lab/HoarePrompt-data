The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `listL[i]` to it. The variable `i` is currently 2, so the value of `listL[i]` refers to the third element of the list `listL`. The previous value of `sum` is the result of `listL[0] + listL[1]`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` will be `sum + listL[2]`.

Since `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, and `listL` is a non-empty list of integers, we know that `listL` has at least three elements (0, 1, and 2 indices). 

The output state will reflect the updated value of `sum`, while `N`, `i`, and `maxL` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 2, `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, and `sum` is the previous value of `sum + listL[2]**
