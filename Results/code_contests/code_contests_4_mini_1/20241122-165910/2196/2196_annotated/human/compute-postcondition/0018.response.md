The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on the constraints stated: `N` is an integer such that \(3 \leq N \leq 10\), and \(L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_N\) are integers such that \(1 \leq L_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(N\). The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return values or behavior without further information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined due to the lack of details about the output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is undefined based on the given constraints.**
