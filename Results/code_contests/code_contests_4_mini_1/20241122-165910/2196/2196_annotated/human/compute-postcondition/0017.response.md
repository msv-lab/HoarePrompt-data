Postcondition: ***`sum` is updated to `sum - maxL`, where `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10. If `maxL` is less than `sum`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. This covers the case where `maxL` is equal to or greater than `sum`, including the edge case where `maxL` equals `sum`, resulting in 'No' being printed.***
