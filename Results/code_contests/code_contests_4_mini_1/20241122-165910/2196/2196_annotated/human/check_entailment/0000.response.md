To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if an N-sided polygon can be formed based on the lengths of its sides. According to the theorem, the polygon can be drawn if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of all the other sides.

### Code Analysis
Here is the annotated program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    listL = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
    maxL = max(listL)
    sum = 0
    for i in range(N):
        sum = sum + listL[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sum` is the sum of the first `N` elements of `listL`. `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list of integers with at least `N` elements, and `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`. If `listL` has fewer than `N` elements, the loop does not execute, and `sum` remains 0.
    sum = sum - maxL
    if (maxL < sum) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`sum` is updated to `sum - maxL`, where `maxL` is the maximum value in `listL`, and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10. If `maxL` is less than `sum`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. This covers the case where `maxL` is equal to or greater than `sum`, including the edge case where `maxL` equals `sum`, resulting in 'No' being printed.
```

### Detailed Breakdown
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `N` representing the number of sides.
   - It reads `N` integers representing the lengths of the sides.

2. **Finding Maximum and Summing Sides**:
   - It calculates `maxL`, the longest side.
   - It sums all sides in a for loop.

3. **Sum Adjustment**:
   - It subtracts the longest side from the total sum of sides.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - It checks if `maxL` is less than the adjusted sum (sum of the other sides).
   - Outputs 'Yes' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise outputs 'No'.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Input Values**: 
   - If we input `3` for `N` and `1 1 1`, the program should output 'No' because the longest side (1) is not less than the sum of the other sides (1 + 1 = 2). The program correctly outputs 'No'.

2. **Equal Sides**:
   - For `N = 4` and sides `2 2 2 2`, the longest side (2) is not less than the sum of the other sides (2 + 2 + 2 = 6). The program should output 'Yes', which is correct.

3. **All Sides Different**:
   - For `N = 4` and sides `1 2 3 7`, the longest side (7) is greater than the sum of the others (1 + 2 + 3 = 6). The program should correctly output 'No'.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if an N-sided polygon can be formed according to the theorem stated in the problem description. I could not identify any edge cases where the program would fail to provide the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
