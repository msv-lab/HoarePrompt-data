The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]` to it. The previous value of `sum` is 0. The value of `listL[i]` is an integer from the user input list, which is within the range of 1 to 100. Therefore, after this operation, `sum` will be equal to `listL[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 0, `L` is a list of N integers where each integer `L_i` satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, `listL` is a list of integers from user input, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, and `sum` is equal to `listL[i]**
