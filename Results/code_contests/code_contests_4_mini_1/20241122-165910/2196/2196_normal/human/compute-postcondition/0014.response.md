The code snippet provided simply prints 'Yes' to the console. No values of the variables change as a result of this operation. The initial state of the variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` will take values from 0 to N-1 during execution, `listL` is a list of N integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, and `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, and `maxL` is less than `sum`; and 'Yes' is printed.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` will take values from 0 to N-1 during execution, `listL` is a list of N integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, and `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, and `maxL` is less than `sum`; and 'Yes' is printed.**
