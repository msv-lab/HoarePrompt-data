The value of `N` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial constraints of `N` remain unchanged, so the output state is `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, and `L` is a list of N integers where each integer `L_i` satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, and `L` is a list of N integers where each integer `L_i` satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100**
