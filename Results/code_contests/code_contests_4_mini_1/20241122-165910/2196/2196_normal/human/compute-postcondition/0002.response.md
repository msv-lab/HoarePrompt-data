The variable `maxL` is assigned the maximum value from the list `listL`. The value of `listL` is derived from user input, but since we do not know the specific values in `listL`, we cannot determine the exact value of `maxL`. However, we know that since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, the list `L` contains between 3 and 10 integers, each ranging from 1 to 100. Therefore, `maxL` will be at least 1 and at most 100, depending on the values provided in `listL`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `L` is a list of N integers where each integer `L_i` satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100; `listL` is a list of integers from user input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL` (1 <= `maxL` <= 100)**.
