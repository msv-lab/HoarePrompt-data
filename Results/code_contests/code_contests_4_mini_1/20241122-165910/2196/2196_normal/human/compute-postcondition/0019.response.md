Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (where 3 <= N <= 10) and a list of `N` integers (each between 1 and 100). It calculates the sum of the integers in the list, subtracts the maximum integer from this sum, and checks if the resulting sum is greater than the maximum integer. It prints 'Yes' if the modified sum is greater than the maximum integer, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not handle cases where user input does not meet the expected format (e.g., if `N` is not between 3 and 10, or if the list does not contain exactly `N` integers).**
