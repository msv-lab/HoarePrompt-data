The `print('No')` statement outputs the string 'No' to the console. This action does not affect the values of any variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` will take values from 0 to N-1 during execution, `listL` is a list of N integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, and `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, and the output is 'No'.
