The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`N`, `L`, `listL`, or `maxL`). Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the newly initialized value of `sum`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `L` is a list of N integers where each integer `L_i` satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100; `listL` is a list of integers from user input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL` (1 <= `maxL` <= 100); `sum` is 0**
