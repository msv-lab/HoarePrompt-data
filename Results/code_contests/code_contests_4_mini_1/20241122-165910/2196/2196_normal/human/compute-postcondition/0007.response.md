To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze it step by step:

1. The variable `sum` is being updated with the value of `listL[i]`. The previous value of `sum` was equal to `listL[i]`, so we can denote this as `sum = sum + listL[i]` which means `sum` will now hold the value of `2 * listL[i]`.
2. The variable `i` is initially `1`, and we can assume that `listL` has at least 2 elements since `i` is accessing the element at index `1`.
3. The maximum value `maxL` from `listL` is not directly affected by this operation.
4. The other variables `N` and `L` remain unchanged since they are not involved in this calculation.

After this operation, the state will reflect the updated value of `sum`, which now equals `2 * listL[i]`. 

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 1, `L` is a list of N integers where each integer `L_i` satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, `listL` is a list of integers from user input, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, and `sum` is now equal to `2 * listL[i]`**.
