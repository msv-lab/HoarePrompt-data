The variable `listL` is assigned a list comprehension that converts input from `raw_input()` into integers. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers and will be split into individual string elements before being converted to integers. The initial state indicates that `L` is a list of integers, and its contents will be determined by the user input. The values of `N` and `L` will not change, but `listL` will be populated based on the provided input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each integer `L_i` satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, and `listL` is a list of integers from user input.**
