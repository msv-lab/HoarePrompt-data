Postcondition: ***`sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` will take values from 0 to N-1 during execution, `listL` is a list of N integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, and `maxL` is less than `sum`.***
