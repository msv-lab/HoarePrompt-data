The variable `sum` is decremented by the value of `maxL`, which is the maximum value from `listL`. The previous value of `sum` is the sum of all elements in `listL`, and `maxL` is the maximum integer in that list. The state of `N`, `i`, and `listL` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` will take values from 0 to N-1 during execution, `listL` is a list of N integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, and `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` will take values from 0 to N-1 during execution, `listL` is a list of N integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, and `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`**
