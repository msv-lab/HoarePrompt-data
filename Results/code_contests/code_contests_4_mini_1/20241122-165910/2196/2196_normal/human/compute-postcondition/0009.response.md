To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the variables, letâ€™s break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `N` is an integer such that \(3 \leq N \leq 10\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `L` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `L_i` satisfies \(1 \leq L_i \leq 100\).
   - `listL` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`.
   - `sum` is now equal to \(2 \times listL[i]\).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `sum = sum + listL[i]` takes the current value of `sum` and adds the value of `listL[i]` to it.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The current value of `sum` is \(2 \times listL[i]\), and we add `listL[i]` to it.
   - Therefore, the new value of `sum` will be \(sum + listL[i] = (2 \times listL[i]) + listL[i] = 3 \times listL[i]\).

4. **Final Output State**:
   - The variable `sum` is updated to \(3 \times listL[i]\).
   - The other variables (`N`, `i`, `L`, `listL`, `maxL`) remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 2, `L` is a list of N integers where each integer L_i satisfies 1 <= L_i <= 100, `listL` is a list of integers from user input, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `sum` is now equal to 3 * listL[i]**.
