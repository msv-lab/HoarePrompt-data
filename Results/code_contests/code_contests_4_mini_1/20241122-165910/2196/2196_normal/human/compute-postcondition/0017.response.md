Postcondition: ***`sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `listL` minus `maxL`, where `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list of N integers each satisfying 1 <= `L_i` <= 100, and `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`. If `maxL` is less than `sum`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, 'No' is printed.***
