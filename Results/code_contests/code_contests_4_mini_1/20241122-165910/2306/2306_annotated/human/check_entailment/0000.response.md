Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program only includes a single function that reads a line from standard input. It does not implement the required logic to process the string of '+' and '-' characters according to the specified pseudocode. 

In more detail:
1. The pseudocode specifies a nested loop where `cur` is updated based on the characters in the string, and `res` is incremented for each character processed.
2. The outer loop runs "to infinity", which suggests that it should find an initial value for `cur` that allows the inner loop to execute without `cur` going negative.
3. The function does not include any of this logic; it merely reads input and does not perform any calculations or checks.

Because the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description and does not implement the necessary logic to compute `res`, it is incorrect. Thus, it fails at every test case since it does not produce any output as required.
