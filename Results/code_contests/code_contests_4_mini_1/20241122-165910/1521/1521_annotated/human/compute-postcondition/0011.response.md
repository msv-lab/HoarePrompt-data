The variable `y2` is assigned the value of `b * cos(-t2)`. The values of `b` and `t2` were previously defined, with `t2` being calculated as `radians(m % 60 * 6)`. The output state reflects the new assignment of `y2` while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values from input; `t2` is calculated as radians(m % 60 * 6); `x1` is assigned the value -a * sin(-t1); `y1` is a * cos(-t1); `x2` is -b * sin(-t2); `y2` is assigned the value b * cos(-t2)**
