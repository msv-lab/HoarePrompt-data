The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads inputs from standard input, which are expected to be four integers representing two lengths (`a` and `b`) and two time components (`h` for hours and `m` for minutes). The function then calculates the positions of the hour and minute hand of a clock based on the given lengths and time. It computes the Cartesian coordinates of both hands and calculates the distance between the two points, which is then printed as the output.

The functionality of the function is to compute and print the distance between the tips of the hour and minute hands of a clock based on the specified lengths and the current time given by the hour and minute. There are no return values from the function, as it directly prints the result.

Functionality: ** The function reads four integers from input representing two lengths and a time, computes the distance between the tips of clock hands based on these values, and prints the result. **
