The function `func` does not accept any parameters as it is defined without any input arguments. Based on the output conditions, the function likely performs some calculations or checks related to integers A and B, which are constrained to be between 1 and 1000, as well as integers H and M, constrained to 0 through 11 and 0 through 59 respectively. However, since the details of the output are not provided, I cannot specify any return values or conditions.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
