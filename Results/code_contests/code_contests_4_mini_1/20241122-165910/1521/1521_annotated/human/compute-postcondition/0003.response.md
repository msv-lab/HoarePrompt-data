Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= 1000; `H` is an integer such that 0 <= `H` <= 11; `M` is an integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 59; and `sys.stdout` is redirected to a bytes buffer, and a function is registered to write the buffered output to file descriptor 1; `input` is now a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and removes trailing carriage return and newline characters.**
