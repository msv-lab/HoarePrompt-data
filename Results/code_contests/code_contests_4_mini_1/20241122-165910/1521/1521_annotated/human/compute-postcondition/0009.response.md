The variable `y1` is assigned the value of `a * cos(-t1)`. The values of `a` and `t1` are derived from the initial state, where `t1` is related to `t2` through the calculation of radians based on `m`. The output state will reflect the new value of `y1` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values from input; `t2` is calculated as radians(m % 60 * 6); `x1` is assigned the value -a * sin(-t1); `y1` is a * cos(-t1)**
