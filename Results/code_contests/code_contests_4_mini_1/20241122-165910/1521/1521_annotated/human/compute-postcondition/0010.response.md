The variable `x2` is assigned the value of `-b * sin(-t2)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `b` (from input) and `t2` (calculated as radians(m % 60 * 6)). Since both `b` and `t2` were determined from input, the output state can express `x2` in terms of these variables without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values from input; `t2` is calculated as radians(m % 60 * 6); `x1` is assigned the value -a * sin(-t1); `y1` is a * cos(-t1); `x2` is -b * sin(-t2)**
