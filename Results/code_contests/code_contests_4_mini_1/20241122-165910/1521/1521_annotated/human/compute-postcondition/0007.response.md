In the given code snippet, `t2` is assigned the value of `radians(m % 60 * 6)`. The variable `m` is part of the initial state, which is assigned a value from input. The expression `m % 60` calculates the minutes in the range of 0 to 59, and multiplying that by 6 converts the minutes into degrees for the clock. The `radians` function then converts the degrees into radians. 

As `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned values from input, their specific values are unknown. However, we know that `t2` will be calculated based on the value of `m`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values from input; `t2` is calculated as radians(m % 60 * 6).

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values from input; `t2` is calculated as radians(m % 60 * 6)**
