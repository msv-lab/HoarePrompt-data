The code reads input values and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m`. It expects that the input will provide four space-separated integers. The values of `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M` are within specified ranges, but their exact values are unknown at this point. The output state will reflect that `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` have been assigned values from the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values from input (space-separated integers)**
