The variable `x1` is assigned the value of `-a * sin(-t1)`. The values of `a` and `t1` are known: `t1` is calculated as `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`, which will yield a specific angle in radians based on the values of `h` and `m`, while `a` is an integer within [1, 1000]. The sine function will then take `-t1`, and the result will be multiplied by `-a`. 

Since `a` is a known integer within the specified range, `x1` will be computed as a specific value, but the exact output cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a`, `h`, and `m`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship and calculations, but does not assign a definitive value to `x1`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within [1, 1000]; `t1` is calculated as radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5); `x1` is calculated as -a * sin(-t1)**
