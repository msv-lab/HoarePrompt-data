The function `func` accepts three parameters: `A`, `B`, and `H`, which are integers within the range [1, 1000], and `M`, which is an integer within the range [0, 11] for `H` and [0, 59] for `M`. The function does not return any specific output as the output details are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept integer parameters `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M` within their specified ranges. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters A and B as integers within the range [1, 1000], H as an integer within the range [0, 11], and M as an integer within the range [0, 59].**
