The variables `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned the values read from the input, split into separate values and converted into integers. The initial state informs us that `A` and `B` are integers within the range [1, 1000], `H` is an integer within the range [0, 11], and `M` is an integer within the range [0, 59]. The specific values of `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M` are not provided, so we denote them as `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` respectively. 

Since the values are obtained from the input, the output state will reflect that `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are now integers, where `a` and `b` are within [1, 1000], `h` is within [0, 11], and `m` is within [0, 59].

Output State: **`a` is an integer within [1, 1000], `b` is an integer within [1, 1000], `h` is an integer within [0, 11], `m` is an integer within [0, 59]**
