The variable `t2` is assigned the value of `radians(m % 60 * 6)`. The value of `m` is within the range [0, 59], so `m % 60` will simply be `m`. Therefore, `t2` will be calculated as `radians(m * 6)`. The variable `t1` is not affected by this code. 

Thus, the output state is: `a` is an integer within [1, 1000], `b` is an integer within [1, 1000], `h` is an integer within [0, 11], `m` is an integer within [0, 59]; `t1` is assigned the value of `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`; `t2` is assigned the value of `radians(m * 6)`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within [1, 1000], `b` is an integer within [1, 1000], `h` is an integer within [0, 11], `m` is an integer within [0, 59]; `t1` is assigned the value of `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`; `t2` is assigned the value of `radians(m * 6)`**
