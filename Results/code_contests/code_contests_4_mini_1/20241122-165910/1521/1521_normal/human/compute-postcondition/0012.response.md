The `print` statement calculates the distance between two points represented by the coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. The distance is computed using the formula for Euclidean distance, which involves squaring the differences in the x and y coordinates, summing those squares, and then taking the square root.

In this case, the values of `x2` and `y2` are calculated based on the variables `b` and `t2`, while `y1` is calculated from `a` and `t1`. The variable `x1` is not defined in the initial state but is presumably an integer or float value relevant to the calculation. The output will be the computed distance based on the current values of these variables.

Since the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` are not provided, we can only state that the output is a distance value derived from those calculations.

Output State: **The distance calculated from the coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is printed.**
