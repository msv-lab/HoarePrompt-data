The value of `h` is an integer within [0, 11] and `m` is an integer within [0, 59]. The expression `h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5` computes the angle of the hour hand in degrees based on the hour and minute. The `radians()` function then converts that angle from degrees to radians.

As `h` and `m` have specific values but are not provided, we cannot determine their exact contributions to `t1`. However, we can express `t1` in terms of `h` and `m`.

The calculation for `t1` can be summarized as follows:
- `t1` is assigned the value of `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`

Since `t1` is a computed value based on `h` and `m`, the output state will reflect the calculation without specific values for `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within [1, 1000], `b` is an integer within [1, 1000], `h` is an integer within [0, 11], `m` is an integer within [0, 59]; `t1` is assigned the value of `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`**
