The value of `y1` is assigned the result of `a * cos(-t1)`. The value of `a` is an integer within the range [1, 1000] and `t1` is previously calculated as `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`. Therefore, the state of `y1` will depend on the specific values of `a` and `t1`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within [1, 1000]; `t1` is calculated as radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5); `y1` is calculated as a * cos(-t1)**
