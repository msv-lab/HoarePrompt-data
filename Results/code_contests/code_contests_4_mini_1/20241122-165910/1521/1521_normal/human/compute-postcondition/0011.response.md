The variable `y2` is assigned the value of `b * cos(-t2)`. The values of `b` and `t2` are not provided, but since `b` is presumably defined in the context and `t2` is calculated similarly to `t1`, we can express `y2` in terms of `b` and `t2`. The values of other variables (`a`, `t1`, `y1`, and `x2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `y2`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within [1, 1000]; `t1` is calculated as radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5); `y1` is calculated as a * cos(-t1); `x2` is calculated as -b * sin(-t2); `y2` is calculated as b * cos(-t2)**
