The variable `x2` is assigned the value `-b * sin(-t2)`. The values of `b` and `t2` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `x2`. However, the variables `a`, `t1`, and `y1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer within [1, 1000]; `t1` is calculated as radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5); `y1` is calculated as a * cos(-t1); `x2` is calculated as -b * sin(-t2).
