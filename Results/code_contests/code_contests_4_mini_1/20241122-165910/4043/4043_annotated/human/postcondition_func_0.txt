The function accepts two parameters, `startIndex` and `branchLength`. It prints a formatted output for the range from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`, producing pairs of consecutive integers in this range. If `branchLength` is less than 2, no output is produced. The function returns the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`, regardless of the validity of the input parameters. It does not check if `startIndex` is within valid bounds or if `branchLength` meets its specified conditions.
