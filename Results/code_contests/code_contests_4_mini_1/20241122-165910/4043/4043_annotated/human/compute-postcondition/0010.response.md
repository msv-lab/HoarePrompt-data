The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `startIndex` and `branchLength`. Both `startIndex` and `branchLength` are integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `startIndex` and `branchLength`, and return their sum. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters startIndex and branchLength, and returns the sum of startIndex and branchLength.**
