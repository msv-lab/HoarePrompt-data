The code prints a formatted string containing the values `1` and `startIndex`. The variable `startIndex` is not defined in the initial state, so we can assume it holds some value that has not been specified. Since `n` and `k` do not affect the output directly, they do not change. The output state reflects the values used in the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and the output is '1 {startIndex}'**
