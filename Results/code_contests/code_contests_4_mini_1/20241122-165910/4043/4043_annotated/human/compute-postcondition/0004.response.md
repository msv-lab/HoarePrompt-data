Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `startIndex` is a valid index (0 ≤ `startIndex` < `n`); `branchLength` is an integer such that `branchLength ≥ 2` and `branchLength ≤ n - startIndex + 1; `i` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`; and the output is the formatted string '{0} {1}' where the first value is `i` and the second value is `i + 1`.**
