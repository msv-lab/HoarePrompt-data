The code formats a string with the values of `i` and `i + 1`, where `i` is calculated as `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Since `startIndex` and `branchLength` are defined within their constraints, `i` will be a valid integer based on those definitions. The output of the print statement will be the two integers `i` and `i + 1`.

The output state will reflect the values of `i` and `i + 1`, but since we do not have specific values for `startIndex` and `branchLength`, we cannot calculate exact numbers for them. However, we can express the output based on the valid range.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and `i + 1` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength`**
