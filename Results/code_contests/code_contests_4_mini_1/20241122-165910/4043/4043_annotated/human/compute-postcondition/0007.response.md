According to the code, the loop iterates from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 2` (inclusive). The loop variable `i` is currently equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, which means it has reached the last valid value for `i` in this range and is not less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. 

Since `i` is currently `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, to allow for one more iteration, we need to modify it to `i` being equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`, which corresponds to the value just before the current `i`.

Thus, the `i` needs to be adjusted to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`, and we need to ensure that `i + 1` is accordingly adjusted to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`.

State: **`i` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`, and `i + 1` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`**
