To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved in the for loop:

- `startIndex` is the starting point for the loop variable `i`.
- `branchLength` must be defined such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1` is within the bounds of the loop.

Given the conditions:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1.

For the loop to execute:
1. The value of `startIndex` must be such that `startIndex` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Hence, `branchLength` must be at least 2 for the loop to make sense (since `i` will iterate from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`).
2. Additionally, `startIndex + branchLength - 1` must not exceed `n`, meaning `startIndex + branchLength - 1 ≤ n`, which implies `branchLength ≤ n - startIndex + 1`.

Thus, we can summarize:
- We need `startIndex` to be within a valid range (0 ≤ `startIndex` < `n`).
- We also need to ensure that `branchLength` is at least 2.

Assuming `branchLength` is defined and meets the criteria, we can conclude with the following state adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `startIndex` is a valid index (0 ≤ `startIndex` < `n`), `branchLength` is an integer such that `branchLength ≥ 2` and `branchLength ≤ n - startIndex + 1`**
