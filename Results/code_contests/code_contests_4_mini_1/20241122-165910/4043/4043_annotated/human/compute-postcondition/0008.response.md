Output State: **If `startIndex` is a valid index (0 ≤ `startIndex` < `n`) and `branchLength` is an integer such that `branchLength ≥ 2` and `branchLength ≤ n - startIndex + 1`, the loop will execute `branchLength - 1` times. The output will be formatted as '{i} {i + 1}' where `i` ranges from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`. If `branchLength` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and no output is produced. If `startIndex` is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than or equal to `n`), the loop does not execute and no output is produced.**
