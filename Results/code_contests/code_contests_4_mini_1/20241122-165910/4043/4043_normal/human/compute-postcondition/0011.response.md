Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `startIndex` (an integer) and `branchLength` (an integer greater than 1). It prints a series of formatted output lines from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`. If `branchLength` is less than or equal to 1 or if `startIndex + branchLength - 1` exceeds a certain maximum (not clearly defined in the code), no output is generated. The function then returns the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`. **
