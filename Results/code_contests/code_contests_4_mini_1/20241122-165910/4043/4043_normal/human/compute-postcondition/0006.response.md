The value of `i` is calculated as `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Since `branchLength` is at least 4, `i` will be at least `startIndex + 3`. The formatted output will then display `i` and `i + 1`, which corresponds to `startIndex + branchLength - 1` and `startIndex + branchLength`, respectively.

The output state will include the values of `i` and `i + 1`. 

Thus, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `startIndex` is a valid integer; `branchLength` is at least 4; `i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, `i + 1` is `startIndex + branchLength`, and the output is '{0} {1}'**.
