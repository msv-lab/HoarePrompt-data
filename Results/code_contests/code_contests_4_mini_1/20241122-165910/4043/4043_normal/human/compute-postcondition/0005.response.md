According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `startIndex` and `branchLength`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 2` (since the loop starts from `startIndex` and goes up to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and the loop must have a `branchLength` that allows for at least one more iteration.

Given that `branchLength` is at least 3, the condition for the loop to execute again can still hold as long as `startIndex + branchLength` is less than or equal to `n` (ensuring we don't exceed `n`).

Thus, we need to adjust `branchLength` to be at least 4 to ensure that there is at least one more iteration possible, and `i` must be set to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `startIndex` is a valid integer; `branchLength` is at least 4; and the formatted output is '{0} {1}' with `i` being `startIndex + branchLength - 1` and `i + 1` being `startIndex + branchLength`.**
