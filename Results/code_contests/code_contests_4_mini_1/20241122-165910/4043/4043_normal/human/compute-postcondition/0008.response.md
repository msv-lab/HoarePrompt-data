Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `startIndex` is a valid integer, and `branchLength` is an integer greater than 1.

Code of the loop:
```
for i in xrange(startIndex, startIndex + branchLength - 1):
    print('{0} {1}'.format(i, i + 1))
```

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1; `startIndex` is a valid integer; `branchLength` is greater than 1; `i` is `startIndex`; `i + 1` is `startIndex + 1`; and the output is formatted as '{0} {1}'.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1; `startIndex` is a valid integer; `branchLength` is at least 3; `i` is `startIndex + 1`; `i + 1` is `startIndex + 2`; and the output is formatted as '{0} {1}'.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1; `startIndex` is a valid integer; `branchLength` is at least 4; `i` is `startIndex + 2`; `i + 1` is `startIndex + 3`; and the output is formatted as '{0} {1}'.

If `branchLength` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and in that case, `startIndex` remains undefined in terms of output, and no output is printed.

If `startIndex + branchLength - 1` exceeds the maximum index of `n`, the loop will not execute, and hence no output will be generated.

Thus, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1; `startIndex` is a valid integer; `branchLength` is greater than 1; if `branchLength` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If `startIndex + branchLength - 1` exceeds n, the loop does not execute and no output is generated. Otherwise, the output will be formatted as '{0} {1}' with i being in the range from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`.**
