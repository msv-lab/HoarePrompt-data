The `print` function outputs a formatted string that includes the values `1` and `startIndex`. The variable `n` has a range between 3 and 200,000, and `k` has a range between 2 and `n - 1`, but these variables do not directly affect the `print` statement. The variable `startIndex` needs to have a specific value assigned to it, but since it is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its value.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `1` is printed along with the value of `startIndex`, which remains unspecified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and the function prints '1' and the value of `startIndex`**.
