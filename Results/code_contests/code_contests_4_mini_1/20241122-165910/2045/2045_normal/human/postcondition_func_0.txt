The function reads multiple test cases consisting of an integer `n` and a string of length `n` containing the characters `.` and `*`. For each test case, it calculates the positions of all `*` characters, determines the median position, and computes the sum of the absolute differences from the median. If there are no `*` characters, it appends 0 to the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads from standard input. There is no handling for invalid input or cases where the input format may not match expectations.
