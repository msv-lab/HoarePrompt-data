The variable `l` is assigned the value of the integer that has been popped from `le`. Since `le` had at least one integer greater than or equal to 2, the state of `le` will now have one less integer, and `l` will hold the value of the integer that was just removed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current states of `t`, `level`, `le`, `zorg`, and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less integer; `zorg` is the new integer popped from `le`; `n` is the integer that was previously popped from `le`; `l` is the integer that has now been popped from `le`.**
