The variable `l` is assigned the value of the integer popped from the list `le`. The value of `le` has one less integer than before. Therefore, `l` now holds the last integer from the previous state of `le`, and `le` is now one element shorter. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer than before, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 1), and `l` is the integer that was popped from `le`.**
