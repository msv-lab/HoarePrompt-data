Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer that was popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer, and `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 2). If `l` (the list of differences between consecutive indices where `level[k] == '*'`) is non-empty, `med` is the middle element of `l` and `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences from `med`. If `l` is empty, `af` is updated to contain 0.***
