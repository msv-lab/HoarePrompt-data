Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer than before, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 1), `l` is a non-empty list of differences computed as [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]***
