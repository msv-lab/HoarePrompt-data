Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer than before, and `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 1). If `l` is a non-empty list of differences, `af` is updated to include the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the middle element `med`. If `l` is empty, `af` contains a single element, 0. In both cases, the state of `af` reflects the computed values based on the contents of `l`.***
