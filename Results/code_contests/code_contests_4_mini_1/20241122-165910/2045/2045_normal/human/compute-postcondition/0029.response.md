The code appends the integer `0` to the list `af`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we can note that `af` is now updated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less integer; `zorg` is the new integer popped from `le`; `n` is the integer that was previously popped from `le`; `l` is now a list of differences between the indices; `af` now includes an additional `0`.
