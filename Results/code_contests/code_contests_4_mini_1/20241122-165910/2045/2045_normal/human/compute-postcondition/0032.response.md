Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (which indicates the number of test cases); for each test case, `n` is the integer popped from `le` indicating the length of the level string; `level` is the string of length `n` consisting of '.' and '*'; `le` has been reduced by the number of elements popped; if the character '*' exists in the level string, `l` contains the differences of the indices where '*' appears, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences from `med`; if there are no '*' characters in the level string, `l` is empty and `af` contains a single element 0. If `zorg` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `le`, `n`, `level`, and `af` remain unchanged.**
