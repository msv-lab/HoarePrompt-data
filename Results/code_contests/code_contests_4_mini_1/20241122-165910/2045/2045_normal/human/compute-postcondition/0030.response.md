Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less integer; `zorg` is the new integer popped from `le`; `n` is the integer that was previously popped from `le`; `l` is now a list of differences between the indices. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle element of the list `l`, and `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each `k` in `l` and `med` appended to it. If `l` is empty, `af` includes an additional `0`.***
