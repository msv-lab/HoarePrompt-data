The code `af.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `af`. There are no changes to the other variables (`t`, `n`, `level`, `le`, `l`, and `zorg`). Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of `0` to the list `af`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer that was popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer, `l` is the last integer popped from `le`, `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 2), `l` is updated to be the list of differences between consecutive indices where `level[k] == '*'`, and `af` now contains one more element: 0**
