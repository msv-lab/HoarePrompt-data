The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It is designed to handle multiple test cases based on the constraints provided. For each test case, it will process an integer `n`, which is within the range of 1 to 10^6, and a string representing the level, consisting of the characters '.' and '*'. The function returns a result based on the analysis of the input string for each test case. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string of length `n`, and return results based on the characters in the string while adhering to the input constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a string of characters '.' and '*', and processes these inputs to return results based on the level described by the string.**
