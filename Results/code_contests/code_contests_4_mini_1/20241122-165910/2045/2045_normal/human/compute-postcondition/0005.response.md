The variable `l` is assigned a new list that is created using a list comprehension. This list comprehension iterates over a range from `0` to `n-1` and includes values of `k` only if `l[k]` is equal to `'*'`. However, since `l` is defined as the integer that was popped from `le`, it is not iterable and cannot be accessed with indexing like `l[k]`. Therefore, this operation is invalid and would cause an error, but since we're asked for the output state, we will state the variables as they were before execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer than before, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 1), and `l` is the integer that was popped from `le`**
