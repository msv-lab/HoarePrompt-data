To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we need to identify how the variables interact and how their values are affected.

- The list `l` contains the differences between consecutive indices where `level[k] == '*'`. 
- `med` is defined as the middle element of the list `l`.
- The line of code `af.append(sum(abs(k - med) for k in l))` computes the absolute difference of each element in `l` from the middle element `med`, sums those differences, and appends the result to the list `af`.

Thus, after executing the given code, the state of the variables is updated as follows:

- The list `af` now contains one additional element, which is the sum of absolute differences calculated.

Since the specific values of `l` and `med` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact result of the sum operation. However, we can state that `af` is updated with a new value based on these calculations.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer that was popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer, `l` is the list of differences between consecutive indices where `level[k] == '*'`, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences from `med`.**
