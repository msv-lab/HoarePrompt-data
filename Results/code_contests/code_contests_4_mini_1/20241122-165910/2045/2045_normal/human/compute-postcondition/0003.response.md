The value of `n` is assigned the integer popped from the list `le`. Since `le` contains at least one integer, the operation `le.pop()` will remove and return the last integer from `le`, and this value will be assigned to `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `n` and the fact that `le` will now have one less integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer than before, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 1)**
