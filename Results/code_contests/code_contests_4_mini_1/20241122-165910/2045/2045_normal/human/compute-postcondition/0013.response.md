According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `zorg` and the integer popped from `le`. The loop iterates `zorg` times, where `zorg` is an integer that has been popped from `le`. Since `le` has one less integer than before at the end of the previous iteration, we must consider the current state of `le` and the value of `zorg`.

At the end of the last iteration, `zorg` is the integer that was popped from `le` (which is greater than or equal to 1) and is the limit for the loop iteration. To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that the range still allows for at least one more iteration. This means that `le` must contain at least one more integer when the next iteration starts.

Since `le` has one less integer than before, it is critical to adjust the state of `le` to reflect that it should have at least one more integer remaining. Hence, the integer popped from `le` must now be adjusted to be `zorg + 1`, which means that `le` should have at least one more integer than it did at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has at least 1 more integer, `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 2)**
