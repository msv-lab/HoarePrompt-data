Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer that was popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer, `l` is the last integer popped from `le`, `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 2), and `l` is updated to be the list of differences between consecutive indices where `level[k] == '*'`.**
