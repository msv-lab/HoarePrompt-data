The code appends the value `0` to the list `af`. Since `af` is initially empty, after this operation, `af` will contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer popped from `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less integer than before, `af` is now [0], `zorg` is the integer popped from `le` (greater than or equal to 1), `l` is an empty list.
