According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `le` and specifically on the result of `le.pop()`, which determines how many iterations the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `le` has one less element than before, and the loop uses the last element of `le` to determine the range for `zorg`. 

Given that `le` has been modified by `pop()`, for the loop to execute one more time, `le` must have had at least one element before the last iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration to be valid, `le` needs to have at least one more element than it currently has, which means we need to adjust `le` to have at least one more element remaining.

Additionally, since `le.pop()` returns the last element of `le`, we need to ensure that it is valid for the loop to execute one more time, meaning that the length of `le` should be at least 2 before calling `pop()` again.

Thus, we need to adjust `le` to indicate that it contains at least 2 elements, and `zorg` will be the next value based on the new last element of the adjusted list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of `m`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has at least 2 elements, `l` is the last element of the original list `le`, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`.**
