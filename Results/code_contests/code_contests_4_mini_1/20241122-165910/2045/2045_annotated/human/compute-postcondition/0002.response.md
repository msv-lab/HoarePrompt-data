According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value popped from the list `le`. The `pop()` method will remove the last element from the list, which should be an integer that determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `le` must contain at least one element, and the value obtained from `le.pop()` must be a valid integer that is greater than or equal to 1.

Before the loop starts, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (this information does not affect the loop execution).
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 (this also does not directly affect the loop execution).
- `level` is a string of length `n` (not relevant for loop execution).
- `le` holds the reversed list of lines read from standard input. For the loop to execute, `le` must not be empty, and the last element of `le` (the one that will be popped) must be a positive integer.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `le` must contain at least one element (ensuring it is not empty).
- The value popped from `le` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Assuming the last value in `le` is `m`, we will denote it as `m` (where `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` is a list containing at least one element, `le.pop()` is `m` where `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `af` is an empty list**
