The operation `l = le.pop()` removes the last element from the list `le` and assigns it to the variable `l`. The variable `n`, which is the last element of `le` before popping, is no longer relevant to the state of `l` after popping. The list `le` will now have one less element, affecting its previous state. The value of `med`, which is the middle element of `l`, may also change depending on whether `l` had an even or odd number of elements before popping. However, since the specifics of `med` and the sum of absolute differences in `af` are not evaluated in this operation, they remain unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the last element of `le` before popping; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `l` is the last element popped from `le`; `med` is unchanged; `af` remains the same.**
