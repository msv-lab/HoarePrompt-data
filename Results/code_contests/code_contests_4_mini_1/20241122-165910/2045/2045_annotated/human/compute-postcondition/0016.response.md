To analyze the provided code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code:

1. **Initial State:** 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is assigned the value of the last element of `le`.
   - `level` is a string of length `n`.
   - `le` has one less element (the last element has been removed).
   - `l` is the last element of the original list `le`.
   - `med` is the middle element of `l`.
   - `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`.
   - After popping, `l` is now the last element of `le`.

2. **Code Impact:** 
   - The line of code `l = [k for k in range(n) if l[k] == '*']` creates a new list `l` that includes the indices `k` in the range of `n` for which the corresponding elements in the original list `l` are equal to '*'.
   - This means that `l` will now hold the indices of the '*' characters in the original `l`. If there are no '*' characters, `l` will be an empty list.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `l` is changed based on whether there are any '*' characters in the original `l`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `level`, `af`, `med`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of the last element of `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less element, `l` is now the list of indices where `l[k] == '*'`, `med` is the middle element of the original `l`, and `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in the original `l` and `med`.**
