The variable `l` is assigned the value of the last element from the list `le` by using the `pop()` method, which also removes that element from the list. The list `le` has at least one element remaining, so after this operation, `le` will have one less element. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `level`, and `af`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of `m`; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `af` is an empty list; `l` is the last element of the original list `le`.**
