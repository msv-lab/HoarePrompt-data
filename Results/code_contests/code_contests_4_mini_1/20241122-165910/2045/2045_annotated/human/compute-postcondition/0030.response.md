Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the last element of `le` before popping; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `l` is a list of differences between indices; if `l` is not empty, `med` is set to the middle element of `l`, and `af` includes an additional value which is the sum of absolute differences between elements of `l` and `med`; if `l` is empty, `med` remains unchanged, and `af` has an additional `0` appended.***
