Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a string of length `n`. It calculates and prints the sum of absolute differences from the median index of all '*' characters for each test case. If there are no '*' characters, it appends 0 to the results. If there are fewer than 3 elements in the input, the function does not process any test cases and simply outputs nothing. **
