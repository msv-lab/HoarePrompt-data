The variable `af` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 for each test case, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` holds the reversed list of lines read from standard input, and `af` is an empty list.
