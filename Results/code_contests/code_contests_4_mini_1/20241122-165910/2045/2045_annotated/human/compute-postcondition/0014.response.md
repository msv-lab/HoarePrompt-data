The value of `n` is assigned the value of `m`, which is obtained by popping the last element from the list `le`. This modifies the list `le` by removing its last element. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know `n` will be an integer derived from the last element of `le`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `le` has at least 2 elements before popping, `n` will be assigned a valid integer value. The output state must reflect the modification to `le` and the assignment of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of the last element of `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less element, `l` is the last element of the original list `le`, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`.**
