The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on the constraints that `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and `n` is an integer for each test case in the range of 1 to 10^6. Additionally, the function processes a `level` string consisting of characters '.' and '*' with a length of `n`. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. 

The function will produce an output based on the input conditions specified. However, since no specific output cases are described in your prompt, we will summarize the behavior based on the input properties provided.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `level` of length `n`, executing operations based on the specified constraints.**
