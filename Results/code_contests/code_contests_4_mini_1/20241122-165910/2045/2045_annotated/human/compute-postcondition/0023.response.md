The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(le.pop())`, where `le.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `le`. The value of `n` is set to this last element, and `le` will now have one fewer element. Other variables are not affected by this operation, so after execution, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` and the reduced length of `le`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the last element of `le` before popping, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less element, `l` is the same, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` contains the previous elements plus the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`.**
