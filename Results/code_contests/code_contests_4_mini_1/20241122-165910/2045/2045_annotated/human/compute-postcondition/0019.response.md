The code appends the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` to the list `af`. The state of `l` and `med` is previously defined, and `af` is already initialized. The output state will reflect the updated state of `af` after the execution of the code.

The sum is calculated as follows:
1. For each element `k` in `l`, the absolute difference between `k` and `med` is computed.
2. All these absolute differences are summed up.
3. The resulting sum is appended to the list `af`.

Since specific values for `l` and `med` are not provided, the exact numerical result of the sum cannot be determined, but the structure of `af` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of the last element of `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less element, `l` is transformed into the list of differences of indices, `med` is the middle element of `l`, `af` now contains the previous elements plus the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`.**
