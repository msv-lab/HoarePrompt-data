The list `l` is modified to contain the differences between the indices of the elements in the original list `l`. Specifically, for each pair of indices `a` and `b` in `l`, the new list will hold the value of `b - a` for each corresponding pair of elements. The value of `med` and `af` are unchanged, and `t` and `n` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the last element of `le` before popping; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `l` is now a list of differences between indices; `med` is unchanged; `af` remains the same.**
