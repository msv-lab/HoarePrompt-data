According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value returned by `le.pop()`. At the end of the last iteration, `le` has one less element, and `zorg` will range from 0 up to the value that was popped from `le`. 

Since `le` has one less element, for the loop to execute one more time, the popped value must be increased by 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `le` has one more element than it currently does, and we also need to ensure that the value `n` (the last element of `le` before popping) is maintained at its original value.

Since the popped value is used for the loop's range, we also need to ensure that `n` is now one more than the previous value of `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than the last element of the original `le` before popping; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one more element; `l` is a list of differences between indices; if `l` is not empty, `med` is set to the middle element of `l`, and `af` includes an additional value which is the sum of absolute differences between elements of `l` and `med`; if `l` is empty, `med` remains unchanged, and `af` has an additional `0` appended.**
