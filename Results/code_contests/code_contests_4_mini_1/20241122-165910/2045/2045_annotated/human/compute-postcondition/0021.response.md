Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the last element of `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, and `le` has one less element. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` contains the previous elements plus the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`. If `l` is empty, `af` includes an additional element 0.***
