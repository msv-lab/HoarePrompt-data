Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of `m`; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `af` is an empty list; `l` is the last element of the original list `le`, and `l` is not None or empty (indicating that the comprehension failed to execute but `l` exists).***
