The code appends `0` to the list `af`. Since `af` remains unchanged otherwise, the output state will reflect the new state of `af` after the operation. The previous values of the other variables do not change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the last element of `le` before popping; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `l` is now a list of differences between indices; `med` is unchanged; `af` is now `af` with an additional `0` appended.**
