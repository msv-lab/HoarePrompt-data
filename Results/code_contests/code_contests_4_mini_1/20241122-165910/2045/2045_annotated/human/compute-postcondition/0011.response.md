The code `af.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `af`. Since `af` is initially an empty list, after executing this line, `af` will contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `level`, `le`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of `m`; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `af` is now [0]; `l` is not the last element of the original list `le`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of `m`; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `af` is now [0]; `l` is not the last element of the original list `le`.**
