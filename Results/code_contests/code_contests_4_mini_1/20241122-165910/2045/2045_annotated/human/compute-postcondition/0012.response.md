Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of `m`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less element, and `l` is the last element of the original list `le`. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`. If `l` is empty, `af` is updated to [0].***
