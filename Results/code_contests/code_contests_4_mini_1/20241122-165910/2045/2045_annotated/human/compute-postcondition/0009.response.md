The code appends the result of the expression `sum(abs(k - med) for k in l)` to the list `af`. The expression computes the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (not directly affected)
- `n` is assigned the value of `m` (not directly affected)
- `level` is a string of length `n` (not directly affected)
- `le` has one less element (not directly affected)
- `af` is an empty list (initially)
- `l` is the last element of the original list `le` (not None or empty)
- `med` is the middle element of `l`

The output state reflects that `af` now contains one value, which is the sum of absolute differences calculated from `l` and `med`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of `m`; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `af` contains the sum of absolute differences, `l` is not None or empty; `med` is the middle element of `l`.**
