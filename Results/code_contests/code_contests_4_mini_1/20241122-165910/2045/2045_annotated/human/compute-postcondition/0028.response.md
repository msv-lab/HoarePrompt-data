The code appends to the list `af` the result of the expression `sum(abs(k - med) for k in l)`. This expression calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`. 

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `l` which contains the differences between indices, and its values influence the calculation.
- `med`, which is the middle element of `l`, also affects the calculation.
- `af`, which will have the new value appended to it.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, `level`, `le`, and `af`, along with the newly appended value to `af`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the last element of `le` before popping; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `l` is now a list of differences between indices; `med` is the middle element of `l` after the assignment; `af` now includes an additional value which is the sum of absolute differences between elements of `l` and `med`.**
