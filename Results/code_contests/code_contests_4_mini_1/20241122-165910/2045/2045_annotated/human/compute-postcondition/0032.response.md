Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned a value from `le`, which is the length of the corresponding `level` string; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` is reduced by the number of elements popped (3 for each loop iteration); `l` is a list containing the indices of '*' characters in `level`, and if it is not empty, `med` is the middle element of `l`; `af` contains the cumulative sums of absolute differences for each iteration, with an additional value added for each non-empty `l` or 0 if `l` is empty. If the initial state of `le` has fewer than 3 elements, the loop does not execute, leaving `af` unchanged, and `t`, `n`, `level`, and `le` remain as they were before the loop.**
