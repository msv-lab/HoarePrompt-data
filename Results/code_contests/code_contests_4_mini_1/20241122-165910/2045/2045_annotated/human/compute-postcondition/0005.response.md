The code snippet initializes a list `l` with elements that satisfy the condition `l[k] == '*'`. However, `l` is already defined as the last element of the original list `le`, which means `l` is a single character or value, not a list. The loop attempts to iterate over `l`, which is incorrect because it is not iterable in the context of the list comprehension.

Since `l` cannot be treated as a list, the comprehension will fail, and no new assignments will take place. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of `m`; `level` is a string of length `n`; `le` has one less element; `af` is an empty list; `l` is the last element of the original list `le`, and the comprehension fails to execute.
