The code appends `0` to the list `af`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, but the state of `af` is impacted. Since `af` is a list that already exists, it will now contain its previous elements plus the newly appended `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `level`, `le`, `l`, and `med` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `0` has been added to `af`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of the last element of `le`, `level` is a string of length `n`, `le` has one less element, `l` is transformed into the list of differences of indices, `med` is the middle element of the original `l`, `af` now includes an additional element 0.**
