The function reads an integer `n` and then `n` sets of three integers `(a, b, c)`. It processes these values to determine which challenger has the minimum of the maximum values, then prints '1' with the index of the challenger with the minimum value or '2' with the indices of two challengers if applicable. It does not return any value and does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is 0.
