Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `third` is in `two`, and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, then no changes occur to `ans` or `two[third]`. If `third` is in `one` but not in `two`, `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not in `one`, the states of `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. The values of `ai`, `bi`, and `ci` remain unspecified throughout this process.***
