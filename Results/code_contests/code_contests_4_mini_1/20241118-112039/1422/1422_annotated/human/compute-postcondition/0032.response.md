Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unspecified, and `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is greater than or equal to `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` remains unchanged and `two[second]` does not get modified. If `second` is in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b` and `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is not in `one`, then the states of `two` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
