Postcondition: ***`challengers`, `one`, and `two` remain unchanged, and `ans` is a non-empty iterable. If `label` is equal to 1 after the loop execution, the output '1' is printed along with the value of `first + 1`, where `cnt` is the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` encountered during the iterations, and `first` is the index at which this minimum was found. If `label` is not equal to 1, the output is '2', followed by `first + 1` and `second + 1`, indicating that `cnt` did not update to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and both `first` and `second` remain unchanged. In all cases, if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged, resulting in the output being determined solely by the current values of `label`, `first`, and `second`.***
