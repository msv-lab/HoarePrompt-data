Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `first` is the maximum of `(a, b)` and the minimum of `(a, b)`, `second` is the maximum of `(a, c)` and the minimum of `(a, c)`, `third` is the maximum of `(b, c)` and the minimum of `(b, c)`, `one` remains unchanged, `challengers` contains one additional tuple `(a, b, c)`, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`**
