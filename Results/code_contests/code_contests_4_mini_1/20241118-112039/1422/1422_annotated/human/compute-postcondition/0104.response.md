Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first` is determined as `max(a, b)`, `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, and `challengers` includes the new tuple `(a, b, c)`, if `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a new tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not in `one`, then there are no changes to `two` or `ans`. This ensures that if `second` is a valid key in `one`, the corresponding values in `two` and `ans` are updated accordingly, while no actions are taken if `second` is absent in `one`.***
