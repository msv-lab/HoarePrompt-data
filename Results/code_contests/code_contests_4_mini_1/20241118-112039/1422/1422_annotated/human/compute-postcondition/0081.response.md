Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `first`, `second`, and `third` are calculated as the maximum and minimum of the pairs `(a, b)`, `(a, c)`, and `(b, c)` respectively. The variable `one` is updated to store `(c, i)` at the index `first` if `first` is not present in `one` or if the value at `one[first][0]` is less than `c`. The variables `second` and `third` maintain their roles in updating the `two` dictionary and `ans` list based on the conditions related to `one`, ensuring that all comparisons and updates respect the current values of `two`, `one`, `first`, `second`, and `third`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
