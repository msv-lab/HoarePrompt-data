Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first` is determined as `max(a, b)`, `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, and `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, if `first` is not present in `one` or if the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to the tuple `(c, i)`. If neither condition is met, `one[first]` remains unchanged. No changes are made to `two` or `ans` in this scenario. All updates to `one` depend on the presence and the value of `c` in relation to `one[first]`.***
