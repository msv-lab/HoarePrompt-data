Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unspecified, `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`, `second` is not in `two`, and if `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to the sum of `one[second][0]` and `b`, and a tuple containing `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not in `one`, the state of `two` and `ans` remains unchanged.***
