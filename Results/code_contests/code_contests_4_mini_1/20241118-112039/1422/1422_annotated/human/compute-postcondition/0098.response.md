Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first` is determined as `max(a, b)`, `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, and `challengers` includes the new tuple `(a, b, c)`, if `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` and `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `two` but `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` remains unchanged. If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and a new tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `first` is in neither `one` nor `two`, there are no changes to `two` or `ans`.***
