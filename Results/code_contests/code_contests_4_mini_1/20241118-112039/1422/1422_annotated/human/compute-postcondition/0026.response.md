Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unspecified, `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, then `ans` includes the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is greater than or equal to `one[second][0] + c`, then `ans` remains unchanged and `two[second]` is not modified.***
