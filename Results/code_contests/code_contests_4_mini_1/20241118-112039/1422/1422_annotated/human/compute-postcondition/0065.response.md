Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `first` is the maximum of `(a, b)` and the minimum of `(a, b)`, `second` is the maximum of `(a, c)` and the minimum of `(a, c)`, `third` is the maximum of `(b, c)` and the minimum of `(b, c)`, `one` remains unchanged, `challengers` contains one additional tuple `(a, b, c)`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` exists in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, and `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c`. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` remains unchanged and `ans` is updated only if `first` is in `one`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
