Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is increased by 1, `first` is the tuple containing the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` is the tuple containing the maximum and minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is the tuple containing the maximum and minimum of `b` and `c`, `one` is unchanged, `two[first]` is updated to the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, `ans` contains an additional tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, and `challengers` contains one additional tuple `(a, b, c)`. The program ensures that if `first` exists in `one`, the respective updates to `two` and `ans` occur, while all other variables remain unchanged.***
