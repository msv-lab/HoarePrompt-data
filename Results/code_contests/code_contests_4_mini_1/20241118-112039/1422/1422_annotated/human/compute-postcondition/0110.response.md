The code appends a tuple to the list `ans`. The first element of the tuple is calculated as `one[third][0] + a`, while the other elements are `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i`. Since the exact values of `one`, `third`, `a`, and `i` are not provided, we cannot determine their specific values. However, we know that `ans` will have one additional tuple appended to it.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated with a new tuple containing the values `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated with a new tuple containing the values `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`**
