Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unspecified, and `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `first` is present in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` and `two[first]` remains unchanged. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, `ans` remains unchanged and `two[first]` does not get updated. If `first` is in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c` and `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not in `one`, the state of `two` and `ans` remains unchanged. Throughout the execution, the integrity of the values in `one`, `two`, and `ans` is maintained.***
