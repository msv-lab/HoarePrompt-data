Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first` is determined as `max(a, b)`, `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, and `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, if `second` is not present in `one` or if the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to the tuple `(b, i)`. If `second` is present in `one` and the first element of `one[second]` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `one[second]` remains unchanged. No changes are made to `two` or `ans` in this scenario.***
