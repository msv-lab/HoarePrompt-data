Postcondition: ***`challengers`, `one`, and `two` remain unchanged; `ans` is a non-empty iterable; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the first values from `challengers[2]`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to this minimum value, and `first` is set to 2. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes are made to `label`, `cnt`, or `first`.***
