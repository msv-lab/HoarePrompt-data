Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first` is determined as `max(a, b)`, `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, and `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, if `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is not less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `two[third]` remains unchanged, and no updates occur to `ans`, ensuring all specified conditions concerning the presence of `second` in `two` and `one` are handled appropriately. Thus, the state of `two` and `ans` will reflect these updates based on the comparisons involving `two[third]` and `one[third][0] + c`.***
