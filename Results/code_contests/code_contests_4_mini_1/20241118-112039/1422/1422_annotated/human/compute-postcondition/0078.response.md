Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1` and `i` is incremented by 1. The variables `first`, `second`, and `third` are calculated as the maximum and minimum of the pairs `(a, b)`, `(a, c)`, and `(b, c)`, respectively; `one` remains unchanged, and `challengers` contains one additional tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is updated with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then it is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and `ans` is updated; otherwise, `two[second]` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated only if `second` is in `one`. Additionally, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, otherwise it remains unchanged, with `ans` updated only if `first` is in `one`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
