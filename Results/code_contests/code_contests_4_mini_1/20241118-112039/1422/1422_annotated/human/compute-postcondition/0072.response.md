Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1` and `i` is incremented by 1. The variables `first`, `second`, and `third` are calculated as the maximum and minimum of the pairs `(a, b)`, `(a, c)`, and `(b, c)`, respectively. The variable `one` remains unchanged, and `challengers` contains one additional tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` and `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`, `two[second]` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated only if `second` is in `one`. Additionally, if `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and if `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, it remains unchanged and `ans` is updated only if `first` is in `one`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
