Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `first`, `second`, and `third` are calculated as the maximum and minimum of the pairs `(a, b)`, `(a, c)`, and `(b, c)`. If `second` is not present in `one` or `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to `(b, i)`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions of `two`, `one`, `first`, `second`, and `third` are respected throughout the process.***
