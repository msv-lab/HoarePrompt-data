Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unspecified, `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`, `third` is not in `two`, and the states of `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not in `one`, the states of `two` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
