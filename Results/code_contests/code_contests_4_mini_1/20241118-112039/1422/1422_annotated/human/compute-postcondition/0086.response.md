According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which implies that `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i + 1` for the next iteration.

Given that `i` has just been incremented, it is now equal to `previous i + 1`. Thus, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `previous i + 2` (which is now `i + 1` in the next iteration). 

No other states need to be adjusted since `first`, `second`, `third`, and `one` conditions remain unchanged due to the criteria provided.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first`, `second`, and `third` are calculated as the maximum and minimum of the pairs (a, b), (a, c), and (b, c), and all other variables remain unchanged**
