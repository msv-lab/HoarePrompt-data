Postcondition: ***`challengers`, `one`, and `two` are unchanged; `ans` is a non-empty iterable; if the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which is greater than 0, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, then `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
