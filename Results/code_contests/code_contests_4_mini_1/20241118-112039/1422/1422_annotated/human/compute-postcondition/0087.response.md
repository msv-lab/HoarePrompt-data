The code assigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())`. This means that `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated based on the values read from the input. The initial state indicates that `first`, `second`, and `third` are computed based on pairs of these variables, but since we don't have the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, we can only state that they will be assigned new values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first`, `second`, and `third` are calculated as the maximum and minimum of the pairs (a, b), (a, c), and (b, c), and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned new values from input.**
