Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented by 1; `first`, `second`, and `third` are calculated as the maximum and minimum of the pairs `(a, b)`, `(a, c)`, and `(b, c)` respectively; `one` remains unchanged; `challengers` contains one additional tuple `(a, b, c)`; the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`.**
