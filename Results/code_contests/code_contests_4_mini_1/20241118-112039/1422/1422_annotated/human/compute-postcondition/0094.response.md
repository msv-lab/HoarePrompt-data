Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first` is determined as `max(a, b)`, `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, and `challengers` includes the new tuple `(a, b, c)`, if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` and `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c`. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` remains unchanged.***
