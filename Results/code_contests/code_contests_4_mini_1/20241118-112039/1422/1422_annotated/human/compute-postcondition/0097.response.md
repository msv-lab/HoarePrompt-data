Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first` is `max(a, b)`, `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, and `challengers` includes the new tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and a new tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
