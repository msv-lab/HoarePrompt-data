Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unspecified, `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`, and `second` is present in `two`. The state of `two` is unchanged, and `ans` may include the tuple `(one[second][0] + c, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` if `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`.***
