Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `previous i + 1`, `first` is determined as `max(a, b)`, `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, and `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, if `third` is found in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` will include the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` will be updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is not less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `two[third]` remains unchanged and no updates occur to `ans`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not present in either `two` or `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. The overall state of `two` reflects these updates based on the presence of `third` in `two` and `one`, while `ans` is modified accordingly based on the conditions outlined.***
