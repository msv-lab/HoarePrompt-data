Postcondition: ***`challengers`, `one`, and `two` remain unchanged; `ans` is a non-empty iterable; `n` is at least 1 and the loop has executed up to `n` times; `i` has taken values from 0 to `n-1`; `label` is equal to 1; `cnt` is the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` that was encountered during the iterations, and `first` is the index `i` at which this minimum was found. If `n` is 0, the loop did not execute, and `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
