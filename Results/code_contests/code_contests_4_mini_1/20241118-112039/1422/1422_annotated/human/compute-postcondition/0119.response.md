According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, the loop can execute again if `i` is updated to `previous i + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `previous i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, and we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than the new value of `i + 2`.

Assuming `i` was previously `previous i`, after the increment it will be `previous i + 1`. Therefore, we need `n` to be greater than `previous i + 1 + 2`, which simplifies to `n` being greater than `previous i + 3`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state accordingly to reflect the increment of `i` and ensure that `n` is still greater than `previous i + 3`.

State: **`n` is greater than `previous i + 3`, `i` is `previous i + 1`**
