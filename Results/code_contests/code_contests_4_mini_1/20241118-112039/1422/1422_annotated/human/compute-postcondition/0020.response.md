Postcondition: ***If `first` is present in dictionary `one`, then `two` contains `first` with its value updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` contains one tuple consisting of the values `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not present in `one`, the state of `two` and `ans` remains unchanged, while `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unspecified, and `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`, with the values of `first`, `second`, and `third` defined as per their assignments.***
