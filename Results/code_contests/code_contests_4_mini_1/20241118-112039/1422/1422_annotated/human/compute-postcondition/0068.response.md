Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1; `first` is the maximum of `(a, b)` and the minimum of `(a, b)`; `second` is the maximum of `(a, c)` and the minimum of `(a, c)`; `third` is the maximum of `(b, c)` and the minimum of `(b, c)`; `one` remains unchanged; `challengers` contains one additional tuple `(a, b, c)`; `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`; if `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` and `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b`; if `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `two[second]` remains unchanged and `ans` is updated only if `second` is in `one`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
