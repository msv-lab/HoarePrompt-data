Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, if `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not in `one`, there are no changes to `two` or `ans`, ensuring that the integrity of the data structures is maintained regardless of the presence of `third` in `one`.***
