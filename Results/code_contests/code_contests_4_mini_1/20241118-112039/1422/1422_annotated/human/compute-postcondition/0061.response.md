Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `first` is the maximum of `(a, b)` and the minimum of `(a, b)`, `second` is the maximum of `(a, c)` and the minimum of `(a, c)`, `third` is the maximum of `(b, c)` and the minimum of `(b, c)`, `one` is unchanged, `two` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` if the condition is met, and `challengers` contains one additional tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` remains unchanged and `ans` is not updated.***
