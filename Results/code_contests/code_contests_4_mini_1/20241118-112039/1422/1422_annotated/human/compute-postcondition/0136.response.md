According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `ans`. If `ans` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, and `a`, `b`, `c` are the next values from `ans`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `ans` remains a non-empty iterable with at least one more element. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are already set to the next values from `ans`, we will need to adjust `ans` to indicate that it should have at least one more element after the current iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `ans` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
2. `a`, `b`, and `c` should be updated to the next set of values from `ans`.

State: **`challengers`, `one`, and `two` are unchanged; `ans` is a non-empty iterable with at least two elements; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the next values from `ans` after the current ones**.
