The function `func` reads an integer `n` which represents the number of challengers. For each challenger, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and builds two dictionaries to track the maximum values associated with pairs of these integers. It checks different combinations of these values to determine which challenger has the minimum of the maximum values across the three integers. 

After processing all challengers, it identifies the challenger with the smallest minimum value of `a`, `b`, or `c` and sets a label accordingly. If the label indicates that the first challenger has the minimum value, it outputs '1' along with the index of that challenger. If another challenger has the minimum value, it outputs '2' along with the indices of both challengers.

The function does not handle the case where `n` is zero explicitly, nor does it return any value directly. Instead, it writes output to standard output based on the comparisons made during the execution.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and then `n` sets of three integers `(a, b, c)`. It processes these values to determine which challenger has the minimum of the maximum values, then prints '1' with the index of the challenger with the minimum value or '2' with the indices of two challengers if applicable. It does not return any value and does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is 0. **
