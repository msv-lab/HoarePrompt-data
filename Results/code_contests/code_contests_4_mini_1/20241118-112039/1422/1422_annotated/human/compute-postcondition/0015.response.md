Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unspecified, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` contains the key `first` with the value `one[first][0] + c`, `ans` is a list that contains a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` remains unchanged, and `two[first]` does not get updated. The program maintains the integrity of the values in `one`, `two`, and `ans` throughout its execution.***
