Output State: **`challengers`, `one`, and `two` remain unchanged; `ans` is a non-empty iterable; `n` is at least 1; `i` has taken values from 0 to `n-1`; `label` is equal to 1; `cnt` is the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` that was encountered during the iterations; `first` is the index `i` at which this minimum was found; the output '1' is printed, followed by the value of `first + 1`.**
