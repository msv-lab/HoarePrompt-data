Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `first`, `second`, and `third` are calculated as the maximum and minimum of the pairs `(a, b)`, `(a, c)`, and `(b, c)`. If `third` is not present in `one` or if `one[third][0]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is updated to `(a, i)`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions of `two`, `one`, `first`, `second`, and `third` are respected throughout the process. In addition, if `third` is already in `one` and `one[third][0]` is greater than or equal to `a`, the state of `one[third]` remains unchanged.***
