Postcondition: ***`challengers`, `one`, and `two` remain unchanged, `ans` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the first values from `challengers`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is assigned this minimum value, and `first` is set to 0. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes are made to `label`, `cnt`, or `first`.***
