The `ans` list is updated by appending a tuple that includes the result of the expression `(one[second][0] + b)`, the first element of `second`, the second element of `second`, the second element of `one[second]`, and the value of `i`. The previous value of `two[second]` is not relevant here, but the state of `one`, `second`, `b`, and `i` will determine the values in the tuple being appended to `ans`.

Assuming that the values of `one`, `second`, `b`, and `i` are known, we can summarize the output state. However, since the specific values of these variables are not provided, we can't specify exact values for the output state. Instead, we can indicate the format of the output.

Output State: **`ans` is updated with a tuple containing (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)**
