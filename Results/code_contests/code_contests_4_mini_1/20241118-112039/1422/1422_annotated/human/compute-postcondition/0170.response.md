The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without parameters. However, it operates based on the constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and for each stone, `ai`, `bi`, and `ci` are integers such that 1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 10^9. 

The output of the function is not explicitly stated in the prompt. Therefore, without additional information regarding what the function returns, we cannot specify the exact output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates on constraints for `n`, `ai`, `bi`, and `ci`, which are integers within specified ranges. The return value is not specified in the provided information.**
