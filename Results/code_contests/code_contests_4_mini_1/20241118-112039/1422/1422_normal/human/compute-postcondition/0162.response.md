Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 2, `one` is empty, `two` is empty, `ans` is a list with at least one tuple containing five elements, and `challengers` is empty, if the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. If the minimum condition is not satisfied, no changes occur to `label`, `cnt`, or `first`.***
