The line of code appends a tuple to the list `ans`. The tuple consists of five elements: the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and the current value of `i`.

The specific values of `first` depend on the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, and thus we can denote them as `first = (max(a, b), min(a, b))`. Similarly, `one[first]` is accessed at index `first`, which still depends on the previous context of `one`.

However, since the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the structure of `one` are not provided, we cannot define the exact numerical values for `one[first][0]` and `one[first][1]`. Therefore, we just summarize the state of the variables involved.

The output state indicates that `ans` has received a new tuple consisting of the calculated values based on the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)), and `ans` has appended the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)**.
