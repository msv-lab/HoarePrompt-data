The code assigns values to `a`, `b`, and `c` using the `map` function to convert the input values read from `stdin` into integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` depend on the input from the user via `stdin`. Since the input is not specified, the output state reflects the assignment without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned from user input as integers.**
