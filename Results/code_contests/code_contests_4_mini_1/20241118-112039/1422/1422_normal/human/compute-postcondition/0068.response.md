Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`, then no changes are made to `two[second]` or `ans`. Additionally, if `first` is in `two` and its value is less than `one[first][0] + c`, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` and a corresponding tuple is appended to `ans`. If `first` is in `two` but its value is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then no changes are made. If `first` is in `one` but not in `two`, `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c` and the same tuple is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not in either `one` or `two`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. All cases regarding the presence of `first` in `one` or `two` and the value comparisons are covered.***
