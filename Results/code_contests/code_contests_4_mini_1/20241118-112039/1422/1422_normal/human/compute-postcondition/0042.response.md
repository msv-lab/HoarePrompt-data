Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If `third` is found in `one`, then `two` is updated such that `two[third]` is equal to `one[third][0] + a`, and the list `ans` now contains the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], 0)`. If `third` is not in `one`, then `two` remains unchanged and `ans` does not include the new tuple. The variables `ai`, `bi`, `ci`, and the lists `two`, `ans`, and `challengers` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
