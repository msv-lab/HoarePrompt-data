The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the list `challengers`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are taken from user input as integers, and `n` is greater than 0 and does not affect the appending operation. The state of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `challengers` now includes the tuple `(a, b, c)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `challengers` includes the tuple `(a, b, c)`**.
