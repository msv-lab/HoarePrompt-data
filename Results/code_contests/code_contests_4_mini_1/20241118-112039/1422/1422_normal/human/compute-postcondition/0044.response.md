Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `third` is either not in `two` or in `one`, and if `third` is in `one`, `one[third][0]` is less than `c`. The lists `two`, `one`, and the tuple `ans` remain unchanged. The variables `ai`, `bi`, `ci`, and the list `challengers` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
