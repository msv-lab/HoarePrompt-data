According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 1. The state of `n` does not need to be changed since it is already greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
