Postcondition: ***`n` retains its initial value, `one` is empty, `two` is empty, `ans` is a list containing at least one tuple with five elements, `challengers` is empty. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is set to `ind1`, while `second` is set to `ind2`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes are made to `label`, `cnt`, `first`, or `second`.***
