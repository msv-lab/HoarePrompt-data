Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and an entry `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, no changes are made to `two[first]` or `ans`.***
