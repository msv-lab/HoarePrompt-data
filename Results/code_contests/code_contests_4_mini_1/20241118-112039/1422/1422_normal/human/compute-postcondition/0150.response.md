Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `one` is empty, `two` is empty, `ans` is a list containing at least one tuple with five elements, `challengers` is empty, and an IndexError occurs when accessing `challengers[i]`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is assigned the value of `i` (which may not be valid due to the IndexError when accessing `challengers[i]`). If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes are made to `label`, `cnt`, or `first`.***
