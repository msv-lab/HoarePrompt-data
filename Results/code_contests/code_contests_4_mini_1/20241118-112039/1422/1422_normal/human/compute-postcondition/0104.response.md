Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, if `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then no changes are made to `two[first]` or `ans`. If `first` is not in `two` but is present in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` and the same tuple is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not in either `two` or `one`, no changes occur in `ans` or `two[first]`. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and `ans` is updated to include a new tuple consisting of `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two[second]` or `ans`.***
