The code assigns values to `second` using the `max` and `min` functions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `first` are already defined as `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`, but `a`, `b`, and `c` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we can only derive the new values for `second` based on the existing variables.

`second` is assigned `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`. 

The values of `first` and `second` are dependent on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, we do not know the specific values of `a`, `b`, or `c` from the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `first` and `second` are defined based on the maximum and minimum comparisons without specifying numerical values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c))**
