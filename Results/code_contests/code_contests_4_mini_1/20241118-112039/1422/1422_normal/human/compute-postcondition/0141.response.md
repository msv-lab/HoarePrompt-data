Postcondition: ***`n` retains its initial value, `one` is empty, `two` is empty, `ans` is a list containing at least one tuple with five elements, `challengers` is empty. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged, and `label`, `first`, and `second` retain their previous values.***
