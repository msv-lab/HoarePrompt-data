The code assigns values to `third` as a tuple containing `max(b, c)` and `min(b, c)`. The variables `first` and `second` remain unchanged, and the values of `b` and `c` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific values of `third`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values and the new variable `third` based on the relationships of `b` and `c`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c))**
