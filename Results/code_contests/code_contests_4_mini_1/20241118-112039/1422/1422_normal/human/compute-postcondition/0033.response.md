Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unchanged, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` may have been updated; if `third` is in `two`, then the state of `two` includes `third`, and the values associated with `third` in `two` are unchanged. The list `challengers` remains unchanged as the list containing the tuple `(a, b, c)`***
