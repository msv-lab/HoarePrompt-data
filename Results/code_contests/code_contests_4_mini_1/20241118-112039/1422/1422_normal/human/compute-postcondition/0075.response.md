Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b` and the same tuple is appended to `ans`. If `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `first` is in `two` but does not satisfy the condition, no changes are made to `two[first]` or `ans`. If `first` is in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c` and the same tuple is appended to `ans`. If neither `first` nor `second` are in `one` or `two`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. Additionally, if `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`, and a corresponding tuple is appended to `ans`.
