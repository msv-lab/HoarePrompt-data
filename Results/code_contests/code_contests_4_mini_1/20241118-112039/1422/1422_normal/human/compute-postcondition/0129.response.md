Postcondition: ***`n` retains its initial value, `one` is empty, `two` is empty, `ans` is a list containing at least one tuple with five elements, `challengers` is empty, if the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to this minimum value, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, the values of `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
