Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unchanged, `one` is an empty dictionary, and `two` may have been updated. If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a`. The state of `two` reflects this update, while the values associated with `third` in `two` remain unchanged, and the list `challengers` remains unchanged as the list containing the tuple `(a, b, c)`. In the case where `two[third]` is not less than `one[third][0] + c`, no changes to `ans` or `two` occur.***
