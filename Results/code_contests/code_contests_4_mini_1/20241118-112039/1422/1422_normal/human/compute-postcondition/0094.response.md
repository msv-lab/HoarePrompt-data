Postcondition: ***If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and a tuple containing `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. There is no change to `two[first]` or `ans` if `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`.***
