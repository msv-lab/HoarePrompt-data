Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai` is unchanged, `bi` is unchanged, `ci` is unchanged, `one` is an empty dictionary containing `first`, `two` is updated to include `first` as a key with the value of `one[first][0] + c`, `ans` now contains one tuple: `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, and `challengers` remains unchanged as the list containing the tuple (a, b, c). If `first` is not in `one`, this branch is not executed and the state of `two`, `ans`, and `one` remains as previously defined.***
