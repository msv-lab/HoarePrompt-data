Postcondition: ***If `label` is 1, the output will be '1' followed by the value of `first + 1`. If `label` is not 1 (which may occur if `n` is 0, `ans` is empty, `challengers` has fewer than `n` elements, or if `min(a, b, c)` cannot be computed), the output will be '2' followed by `first + 1` and `second + 1`, and the values of `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
