Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `two[third]` is not less than `one[third][0] + c`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`. If `third` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` includes the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not in `one`, both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `first` is not in `one` or `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is assigned the value `(c, 0)`. The variables `ai`, `bi`, `ci`, and the lists `challengers` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
