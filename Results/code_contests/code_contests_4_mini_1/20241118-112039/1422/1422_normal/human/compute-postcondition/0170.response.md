The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates with a set of constraints where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of stones, and for each stone indexed by `i` (from 1 to `n`), it uses three positive integers `ai`, `bi`, and `ci` which represent the dimensions of the rectangular parallelepiped. 

The function returns a specific output based on the dimensions of the stones. However, the exact output is not provided in detail. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a number of stones, each defined by their dimensions, and output a result based on those dimensions.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes information about `n` stones, each defined by three dimensions `ai`, `bi`, and `ci`, and returns a result based on these dimensions.**
