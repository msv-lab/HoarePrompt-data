The code reads an integer value from the standard input, which represents the number of stones `n`. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), the new assignment will update `n` with the integer provided via standard input. Other variables representing the dimensions of the rectangular parallelepiped (ai, bi, ci) are not affected at this point as they are not involved in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and the dimensions ai, bi, ci remain unchanged**
