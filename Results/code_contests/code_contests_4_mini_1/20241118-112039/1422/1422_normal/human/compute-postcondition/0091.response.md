The code assigns `third` to a tuple consisting of the maximum and minimum values between `b` and `c`. However, the values of `b` and `c` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the assignment of `third`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c))**
