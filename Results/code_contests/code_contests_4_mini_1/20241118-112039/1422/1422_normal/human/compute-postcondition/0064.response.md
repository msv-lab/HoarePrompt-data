Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` is present in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, and the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
