Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unchanged, `one` is an empty dictionary, and `two` may have been updated. If `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a new tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `one`, `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` contains one tuple: `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. The list `challengers` remains unchanged as the list containing the tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `first` is not in `one`, this branch is not executed, leaving `two` and `ans` unchanged.***
