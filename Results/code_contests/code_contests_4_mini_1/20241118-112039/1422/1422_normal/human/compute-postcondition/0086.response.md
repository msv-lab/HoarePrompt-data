According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure the loop condition is satisfied.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now 2, and `n` is greater than 1 to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
