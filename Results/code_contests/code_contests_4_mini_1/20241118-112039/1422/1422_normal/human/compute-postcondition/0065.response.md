Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `first` is in `two` but `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, no changes are made to `two[first]` or `ans`. If `first` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c` and the same tuple is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not in either `one` or `two`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. This covers all cases regarding the presence of `first` in `one` or `two` and the value comparisons involved.***
