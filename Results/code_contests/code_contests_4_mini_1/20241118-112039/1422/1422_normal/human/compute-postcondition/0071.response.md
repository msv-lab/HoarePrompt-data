Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple containing `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], 1)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. Additionally, if `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `first` is in `two` but `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, no changes are made. If `first` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c` and the same tuple is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not in either `one` or `two`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. This covers all cases regarding the presence of `first` and `second` in `one` and `two`, along with the relevant updates to `two` and `ans`.***
