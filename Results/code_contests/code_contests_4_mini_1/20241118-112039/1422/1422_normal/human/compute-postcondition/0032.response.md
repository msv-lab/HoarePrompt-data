Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unchanged, `one` is an empty dictionary, and `two` may have been updated. If `second` is in `two`, and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a new tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is in `two` but `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`, then both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `second` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` contains the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is not in `one`, then `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. The list `challengers` remains unchanged as the list containing the tuple `(a, b, c)`.***
