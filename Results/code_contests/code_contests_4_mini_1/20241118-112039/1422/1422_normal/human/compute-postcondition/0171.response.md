Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from input, which indicates the number of challengers. For each challenger, it reads three integers representing dimensions and processes them to track the maximum values of pairs of dimensions. It maintains two dictionaries to compare and update sums associated with these pairs. The function eventually determines which challenger has the smallest minimum dimension among the processed data and outputs either '1' followed by the index of this challenger or '2' followed by the indices of two challengers, depending on the computed results. If there are no challengers (n is 0), or if inputs are invalid, the function may not behave as intended, leading to potential errors. **
