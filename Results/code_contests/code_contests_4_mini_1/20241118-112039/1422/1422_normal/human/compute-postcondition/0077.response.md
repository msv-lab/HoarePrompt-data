The `ans` list is updated by appending a tuple. The tuple consists of five elements: the result of `one[third][0] + a`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i`. The values of `one`, `third`, and `a` are not specified, but they are used in the calculation and assignment. 

Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, the state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. The output state reflects the addition of the new tuple to the `ans` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `ans` is updated with the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], 1)**
