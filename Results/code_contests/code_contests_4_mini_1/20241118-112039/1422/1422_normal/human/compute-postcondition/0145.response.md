The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the tuple at index `i` of the `challengers` list. Since `challengers` is empty, attempting to access `challengers[i]` will result in an IndexError. However, the output state will indicate the current situation without altering the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `one` is empty, `two` is empty, `ans` is a list containing at least one tuple with five elements, `challengers` is empty, and an IndexError occurs when accessing challengers[i].**
