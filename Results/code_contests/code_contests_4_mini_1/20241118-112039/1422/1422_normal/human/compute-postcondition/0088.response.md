The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the list `challengers`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are taken from input processed as integers. The initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, but indicates that they are integers from input. The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `challengers` has been updated with the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `challengers` is updated with the tuple (a, b, c) from input**
