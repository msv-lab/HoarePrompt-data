Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unchanged, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` may have been updated; `third` is in `two` and the state of `two` includes `third`, with the values associated with `third` in `two` unchanged. The list `challengers` remains unchanged as the list containing the tuple `(a, b, c)`. Additionally, the value associated with `third` in `two` is less than the sum of the first element of `one[third]` and `c`.***
