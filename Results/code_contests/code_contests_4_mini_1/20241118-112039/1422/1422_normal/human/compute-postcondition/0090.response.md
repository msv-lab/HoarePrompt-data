The code assigns values to `second` using the `max` and `min` functions. The first part, `max(a, c)`, calculates the maximum value between `a` and `c`, while the second part, `min(a, c)`, calculates the minimum value between `a` and `c`. The values of `a` and `c` are not provided, but `first` is already defined as `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`. Therefore, `second` will be assigned as `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`.

The output state indicates that the variables `first` and `second` are defined based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as follows:
- `first` is `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`
- `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`

Since no specific values for `a`, `b`, or `c` are provided, the output reflects their relationships.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c))**
