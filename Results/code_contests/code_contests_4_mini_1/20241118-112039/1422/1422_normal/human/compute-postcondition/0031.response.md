Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ai`, `bi`, `ci` are unchanged, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` remains unchanged, and the list `challengers` contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `second` is a key in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to the sum of `one[second][0]` and `b`, and a new tuple is appended to `ans` consisting of the values `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is not in `one`, then `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. Additionally, `second` is not present in `two`.***
