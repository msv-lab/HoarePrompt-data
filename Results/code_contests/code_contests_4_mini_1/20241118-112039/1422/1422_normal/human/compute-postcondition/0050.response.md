Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The variable `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`. The variables `two`, `ans`, `ai`, `bi`, `ci`, and the list `challengers` remain unchanged. If `first` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is assigned the value `(c, 0)`.***
