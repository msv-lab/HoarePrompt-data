You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kostya is a genial sculptor, he has an idea: to carve a marble sculpture in the shape of a sphere. Kostya has a friend Zahar who works at a career. Zahar knows about Kostya's idea and wants to present him a rectangular parallelepiped of marble from which he can carve the sphere. 

Zahar has n stones which are rectangular parallelepipeds. The edges sizes of the i-th of them are ai, bi and ci. He can take no more than two stones and present them to Kostya. 

If Zahar takes two stones, he should glue them together on one of the faces in order to get a new piece of rectangular parallelepiped of marble. Thus, it is possible to glue a pair of stones together if and only if two faces on which they are glued together match as rectangles. In such gluing it is allowed to rotate and flip the stones in any way. 

Help Zahar choose such a present so that Kostya can carve a sphere of the maximum possible volume and present it to Zahar.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

n lines follow, in the i-th of which there are three integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 109) — the lengths of edges of the i-th stone. Note, that two stones may have exactly the same sizes, but they still will be considered two different stones.

Output

In the first line print k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2) the number of stones which Zahar has chosen. In the second line print k distinct integers from 1 to n — the numbers of stones which Zahar needs to choose. Consider that stones are numbered from 1 to n in the order as they are given in the input data.

You can print the stones in arbitrary order. If there are several answers print any of them.

Note

In the first example we can connect the pairs of stones:

  * 2 and 4, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 × 2 × 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1
  * 2 and 5, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 × 2 × 8 or 6 × 2 × 4 or 3 × 4 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1, or 1, or 1.5 respectively. 
  * 2 and 6, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 × 5 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1.5
  * 4 and 5, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 × 2 × 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1
  * 5 and 6, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 × 4 × 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1.5



Or take only one stone:

  * 1 the size of the parallelepiped: 5 × 5 × 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere 2.5
  * 2 the size of the parallelepiped: 3 × 2 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1
  * 3 the size of the parallelepiped: 1 × 4 × 1, the radius of the inscribed sphere 0.5
  * 4 the size of the parallelepiped: 2 × 1 × 3, the radius of the inscribed sphere 0.5
  * 5 the size of the parallelepiped: 3 × 2 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1
  * 6 the size of the parallelepiped: 3 × 3 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1.5



It is most profitable to take only the first stone. 
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

n = int(stdin.readline())
one = {}
two = {}
ans = []
challengers = []
for i in range(n):
    (a, b, c) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    challengers.append((a, b, c))
    first = (max(a, b), min(a, b))
    second = (max(a, c), min(a, c))
    third = (max(b, c), min(b, c))
    if first in two:
        if two[first] < one[first][0] + c:
            ans.append((one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i))
            two[first] = one[first][0] + c
    elif first in one:
        two[first] = one[first][0] + c
        ans.append((one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i))
    if second in two:
        if two[second] < one[second][0] + c:
            ans.append((one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i))
            two[second] = one[second][0] + b
    elif second in one:
        two[second] = one[second][0] + b
        ans.append((one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i))
    if third in two:
        if two[third] < one[third][0] + c:
            ans.append((one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i))
            two[third] = one[third][0] + a
    elif third in one:
        two[third] = one[third][0] + a
        ans.append((one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i))
    if first not in one or one[first][0] < c:
        one[first] = (c, i)
    if second not in one or one[second][0] < b:
        one[second] = (b, i)
    if third not in one or one[third][0] < a:
        one[third] = (a, i)
label = 0
cnt = 0
for (a, b, c, ind1, ind2) in ans:
    if min(min(a, b), c) > cnt:
        label = 2
        cnt = min(min(a, b), c)
        first = ind1
        second = ind2
for i in range(n):
    (a, b, c) = challengers[i]
    if min(min(a, b), c) > cnt:
        label = 1
        cnt = min(min(a, b), c)
        first = i
if label == 1:
    stdout.write('1' + '\n' + str(first + 1))
else:
    stdout.write('2' + '\n' + str(first + 1) + ' ' + str(second + 1))
```
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` from input, which indicates the number of challengers. For each challenger, it reads three integers representing dimensions and processes them to track the maximum values of pairs of dimensions. It maintains two dictionaries to compare and update sums associated with these pairs. The function eventually determines which challenger has the smallest minimum dimension among the processed data and outputs either '1' followed by the index of this challenger or '2' followed by the indices of two challengers, depending on the computed results. If there are no challengers (n is 0), or if inputs are invalid, the function may not behave as intended, leading to potential errors.

First I want you to try to see if the code does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code must exactly follow the problem description for all cases to be correct.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
