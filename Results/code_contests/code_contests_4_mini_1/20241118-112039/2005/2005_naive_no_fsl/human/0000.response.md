Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description. The logic of the program is unclear and does not implement the necessary steps to determine the number of shuffling operations required to move the marble from position `s` to position `t`. 

For instance, consider the input case:

```
4 2 1
2 3 4 1
```

According to the problem, the marble starts at position `2` and after 3 shuffling operations, it should end up at position `1`. The expected output is `3`, but the program does not compute this. Instead, it incorrectly tries to perform a mathematical operation involving the sums of the input values, which is irrelevant to the task at hand. 

Another example can be:

```
4 3 3
4 1 3 2
```

Here, the marble starts and ends at position `3`, hence the expected output is `0`, indicating no operations are needed. The program will not return `0` as it does not handle the logic for identifying when the starting position is the same as the target position.

Since the program fails to correctly implement the required logic for any input, it cannot be considered correct.
