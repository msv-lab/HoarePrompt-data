Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem involves tracking the movements of a marble under glasses during a series of shuffling operations and determining the minimum number of operations needed to get from starting position `s` to target position `t`.

The program uses the line:
```python
print - (sum(IN()) - sum(IN()))
```
This line attempts to perform a calculation involving the input, but it does not store or track the shuffling operations or the positions of the glasses. The logic to simulate the shuffling and count the number of operations is completely missing.

For example, if we take the input:
```
4 2 1
2 3 4 1
```
The correct output should be `3`, as it requires three shuffles to move the marble from position `2` to position `1`. However, the program would not be able to compute this and instead would simply try to compute a difference between two sums, which is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

Thus, the program fails to address the problem requirements, resulting in a correctness of **False**.
