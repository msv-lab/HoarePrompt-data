The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on the following constraints: `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `s` and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ s, t ≤ n. Additionally, the function processes a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `pi` satisfies 1 ≤ pi ≤ n. After executing the function body, it will return a result based on the relationships and constraints provided.

Since the output conditions are not specified in detail, I can only summarize the expected functionality based on the provided input constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer `n`, two integers `s` and `t`, and a list of `n` distinct integers, returning a result based on the relationships defined among these inputs.**
