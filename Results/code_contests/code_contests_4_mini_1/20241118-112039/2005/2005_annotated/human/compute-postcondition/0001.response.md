The code snippet contains two calls to the function `IN()`, which reads input values and converts them to integers, but the output of the first call is subtracted by the output of the second call. 

Since `n` is a positive integer within the defined constraints and `p` is a list of distinct integers between 1 and `n`, each `IN()` call represents the reading of a list of integers that will be summed. The output of `print - (sum(IN()) - sum(IN()))` will ultimately depend on the specific values returned by the two calls to `IN()`.

However, since the specific values of the input from `IN()` are not provided and the operation performed is a subtraction of two sums, we can only conclude that the result will be negative of the difference between the sums of the two lists read by the `IN()` calls.

Because we cannot determine the exact numbers involved in this operation, we can only express the output state in terms of a mathematical representation of the sums.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` and `t` are integers within range, and the output is the negative of the difference between the sums of two inputs.**
