You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are two popular keyboard layouts in Berland, they differ only in letters positions. All the other keys are the same. In Berland they use alphabet with 26 letters which coincides with English alphabet.

You are given two strings consisting of 26 distinct letters each: all keys of the first and the second layouts in the same order. 

You are also given some text consisting of small and capital English letters and digits. It is known that it was typed in the first layout, but the writer intended to type it in the second layout. Print the text if the same keys were pressed in the second layout.

Since all keys but letters are the same in both layouts, the capitalization of the letters should remain the same, as well as all other characters.

Input

The first line contains a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters. This is the first layout.

The second line contains a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters. This is the second layout.

The third line contains a non-empty string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits. This is the text typed in the first layout. The length of s does not exceed 1000.

Output

Print the text if the same keys were pressed in the second layout.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    layout1 = raw_input()
    layout2 = raw_input()
    s = raw_input()
    Mods = ''
    dic = {}
    for i in range(26):
        dic[layout1[i]] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dic` will contain the mapping of the first 26 characters of `layout1` to their respective indices (0 to 25), with `i` being the current index. If `layout1` has fewer than 26 characters, the loop will only execute for the number of characters present, and `dic` will only contain entries for those characters. If `layout1` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `dic` will remain an empty dictionary.
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i].isdigit():
            Mods += s[i]
        elif s[i].isupper():
            Mods += layout2[dic[s[i].lower()]].upper()
        else:
            Mods += layout2[dic[s[i]]]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dic` contains the mapping of the first 26 characters of `layout1` to their respective indices, `Mods` is a string that reflects the transformations applied to each character in `s` based on whether it is a digit, uppercase letter, or lowercase letter. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `dic` remains as is (mapping or empty) while `Mods` is also an empty string. If `s` has fewer characters than the length of `dic`, the loop executes only for the characters present in `s`, and `Mods` will only include transformations for those characters.
    print(Mods)

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
