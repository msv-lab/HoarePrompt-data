Postcondition: ***`dic` contains the mapping of the first 26 characters of `layout1` to their respective indices, `i` is 2, and `s` has at least 3 characters. If the character at index 2 of `s` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated with the corresponding character from `layout2` based on the lowercase version of `s[2]`. If the character at index 2 of `s` is lowercase, `Mods` is updated by adding the character from `layout2` corresponding to `s[2]`. In both cases, `Mods` reflects the appropriate character transformation based on the case of the character at index 2 of `s`.***
