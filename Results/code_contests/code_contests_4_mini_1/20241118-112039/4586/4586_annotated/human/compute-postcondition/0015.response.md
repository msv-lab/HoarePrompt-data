The statement `Mods += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the variable `Mods`. Since `s` has at least 1 character and the character at index `i` is a digit, `Mods` will now contain this digit as a string. The value of `Mods` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dic` contains the mapping of the first 26 characters of `layout1` to their respective indices, `i` is 0, `s` has at least 1 character, the character at index `i` of `s` is a digit, and `Mods` is updated to include the digit at `s[i]`.
