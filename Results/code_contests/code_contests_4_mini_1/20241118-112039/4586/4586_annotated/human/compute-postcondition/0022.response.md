Postcondition: ***`dic` contains the mapping of the first 26 characters of `layout1` to their respective indices, `i` is 0, and `s` has at least 1 character. If the character at index `i` of `s` is a digit, `Mods` is updated to include that digit. If the character at index `i` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase character from `layout2` corresponding to the index of the lowercase version of that letter. If the character at index `i` is a lowercase letter, `Mods` is updated by adding the character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to that lowercase character. Thus, `Mods` reflects the appropriate transformation based on whether the character at `s[i]` is a digit, uppercase letter, or lowercase letter.***
