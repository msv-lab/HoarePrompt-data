The code snippet `Mods += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the variable `Mods`. Given that `i` is 1, the character at index 1 of `s` will be added to `Mods`. The values of `dic` remain unaffected, and since `s` has at least one character, we assume `s[1]` is a valid character.

Therefore, the output state reflects the original character at index 1 of `s` being added to `Mods`. The precise character is not specified, so we refer to it as `s[1]`.

Output State: **`dic` contains the mapping of the first 26 characters of `layout1` to their respective indices, `i` is 1, `s` has at least 1 character, and `Mods` is updated by adding `s[1]`**.
