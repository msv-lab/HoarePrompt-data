Postcondition: ***`dic` contains the mapping of the first 26 characters of `layout1` to their respective indices, `i` is 0, and `s` has at least 1 character, where the character at index `i` of `s` is not a digit. If the character at index `i` of `s` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to the lowercase version of that character. If the character at index `i` is lowercase, `Mods` is updated by adding the character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to that lowercase character. In both cases, `Mods` reflects the transformation of the character at index `i` according to its case as defined by the conditions.***
