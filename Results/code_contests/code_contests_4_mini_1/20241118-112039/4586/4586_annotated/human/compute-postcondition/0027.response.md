Postcondition: ***`dic` contains the mapping of the first 26 characters of `layout1` to their respective indices, `i` is 1, and `s` has at least 1 character. If the character at `s[1]` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated with the uppercase character from `layout2` at the index specified by `dic[s[1].lower()]`. If the character at `s[1]` is lowercase, `Mods` is increased by the character from `layout2` at the index specified by `dic[s[1]]`.***
