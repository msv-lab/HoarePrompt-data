Functionality: ** The function accepts two string inputs `layout1` and `layout2`, each expected to be 26 characters long, and a string `s` that can contain digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. It constructs a new string `Mods` by translating characters in `s` based on their mappings from `layout1` to `layout2`. Digits are directly appended to `Mods`, uppercase letters are converted using their lowercase counterpart's mapping, and lowercase letters are directly replaced using `layout2`. If any characters in `s` are not found in `dic`, it may raise an error due to a missing key, which is not handled in the code. The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the resulting `Mods` string.**
