Output State: **`dic` contains key-value pairs for the first 26 characters of `layout1` mapped to their respective indices (0 to 25). If `layout1` has fewer than 26 characters, then `dic` will contain only as many key-value pairs as there are characters in `layout1`. If `layout1` is empty or does not have enough characters, the loop will not execute, and `dic` will remain empty.**
