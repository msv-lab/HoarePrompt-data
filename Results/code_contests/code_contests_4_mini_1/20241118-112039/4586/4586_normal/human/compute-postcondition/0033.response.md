Postcondition: ***`dic` contains key-value pairs for the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by appending `layout2[dic[s[2].lower()]].upper()`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is lowercase, `Mods` is updated by appending `layout2[dic[s[i]]]`. In all cases, `Mods` reflects the transformation of the character at index `i` based on its case, ensuring that the corresponding value from `layout2` is accurately incorporated into `Mods`.***
