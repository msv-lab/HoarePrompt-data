Postcondition: ***`dic` contains key-value pairs for the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is a digit, `Mods` is updated to include that digit. If the character is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by appending the value from `layout2[dic[s[i].lower()]].upper()`. If the character is lowercase, `Mods` is updated by appending `layout2[dic[s[i]]]`. In all cases, `Mods` reflects the corresponding mapped value from `layout2` based on the character at index `i` of `s`.***
