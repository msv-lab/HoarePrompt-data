Postcondition: ***`dic` contains key-value pairs for the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is a digit, `Mods` is increased by `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase value from `layout2` indexed by `dic[s[i].lower()]`. If `s[i]` is neither a digit nor an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the value from `layout2` indexed by `dic[s[i]]`. In all cases, the integrity of the mappings in `dic` and the lengths of `layout2` are assumed to be valid.***
