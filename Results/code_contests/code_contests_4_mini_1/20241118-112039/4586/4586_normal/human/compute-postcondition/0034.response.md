Postcondition: ***`dic` contains key-value pairs for the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is a digit, `Mods` is updated to include that digit. If the character is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase transformation of the corresponding value from `layout2` for the lowercase version of that character. If the character is lowercase, `Mods` is updated by appending the corresponding value from `layout2` without modification. In all cases, `Mods` reflects the transformation of the character at index `i` based on its type, ensuring accurate incorporation of the corresponding value from `layout2`.***
