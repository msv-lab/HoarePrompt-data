To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `t` test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a permutation `p` of length `2n`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function Logic**: The core logic is within `func_4(N)`, which processes the permutation `P`:

   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` with a placeholder value `[10^5]`.
   - It iterates over the elements of `P` in reverse order. For each element `c`, it checks its relationship with the last elements of `a` and `b`:
     - If `c` is larger than both last elements, it sets `fail` to `True` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it decides whether to append `c` to `a` or `b` based on their current sizes and last elements.

3. **Final Check**: After processing `P`, it checks if the length of `a` is `N + 1`. If not, it sets `fail` to `True`, indicating that it could not successfully create two valid arrays `a` and `b`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints "NO" if `fail` is `True`, or "YES" otherwise.

### Potential Cases to Consider for Correctness

- The core logic attempts to simulate the merging process but does not guarantee that `a` and `b` will contain the correct elements, especially in cases where the permutation `p` is structured in such a way that the merging conditions fail.

#### Example Case

Consider the permutation `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]` with `n = 2`. 

- Expected: There should exist arrays `a` and `b` such that `merge(a, b) = [2, 1, 4, 3]`.
- Potential splits could be:
  - `a = [2, 3]`, `b = [1, 4]` → merge(2, 1) → [1, 2, 4, 3] (fails)
  - `a = [1, 4]`, `b = [2, 3]` → merge(1, 2) → [1, 2, 3, 4] (fails)

The program would incorrectly classify that it can form the required arrays, but it cannot.

### Conclusion

Given that the logic in `func_4` does not correctly account for the merging requirements as specified in the problem description, and the example demonstrates a case where the program fails, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
