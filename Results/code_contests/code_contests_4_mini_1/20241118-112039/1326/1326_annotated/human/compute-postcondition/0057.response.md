Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers. If `b` is not empty and the length and last element of `b` are both less than those of `a`, then `c` is appended to `b`. If `b` is empty or `c` does not meet the conditions for appending, then `b` remains unchanged. In the case where the conditions for the if statement are not met, `a` is modified to include `c`, while `b` and `fail` remain unchanged. Overall, `b` may either contain `c` or remain the same, while `a` will include `c` only if the conditions for appending to `b` are not satisfied.***
