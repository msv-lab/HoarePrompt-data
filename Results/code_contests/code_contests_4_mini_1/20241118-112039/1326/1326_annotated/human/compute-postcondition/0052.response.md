The code appends `c` to the list `b`. The initial state provides no specific values for `b` or `c`, so we cannot determine the previous contents of `b` or the value of `c`. Since `b` now includes `c`, the output state reflects the addition of `c` to `b`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` has `c` appended to it; other variables remain unchanged**.
