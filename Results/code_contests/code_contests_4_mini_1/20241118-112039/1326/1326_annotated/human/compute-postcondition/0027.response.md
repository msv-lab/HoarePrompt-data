The list `a` is modified by appending the value of `c`, which is the next element of `P` in reverse order. Since `a` currently contains [100000] and `c` is being added to it, the updated state of `a` will now include `c` as its second element. The values of `N`, `P`, `b`, and `fail` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is a list containing [100000, c]; `b` remains unchanged; `fail` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is a list containing [100000, c]; `b` remains unchanged; `fail` remains unchanged.**
