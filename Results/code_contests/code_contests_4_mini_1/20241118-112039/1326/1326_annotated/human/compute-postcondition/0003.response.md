The variable `fail` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `fail` while retaining the previous values of `N`, `P`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is [100000]; `b` is [100000]; `fail` is False**
