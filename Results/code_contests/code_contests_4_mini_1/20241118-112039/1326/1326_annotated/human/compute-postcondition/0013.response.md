Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is a list that contains [100000] and possibly `c`, where `c` is the last element of `P` after the first iteration. The length of `a` is 1, and `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, which is 100000. If `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged and the value of `fail` is unaffected by the if condition.***
