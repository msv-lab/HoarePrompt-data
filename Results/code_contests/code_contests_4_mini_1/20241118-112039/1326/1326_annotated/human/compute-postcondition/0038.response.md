Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `b` is updated to include `c`, and the current loop iteration is skipped. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `b`, `b` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, then `fail` is set to True, indicating a failure condition.***
