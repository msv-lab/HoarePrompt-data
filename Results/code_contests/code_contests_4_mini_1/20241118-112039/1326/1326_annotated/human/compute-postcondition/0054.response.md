Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers, and `b` is a list that may or may not have been modified. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` is appended to `b` and the next iteration of the loop is initiated. If `b` was originally empty or if `c` does not satisfy the conditions for appending, then `b` remains unchanged, and the value of `fail` remains unchanged as well.***
