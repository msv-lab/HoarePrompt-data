Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; if `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `a`, and the next iteration of the loop is initiated. If the length of `a` is equal to 1, `c` is appended to `a` without changing `fail`, and if `c` does not satisfy the conditions for appending or setting `fail`, no changes are made to `fail` or `a`, ensuring that `fail` remains unchanged in these cases.***
