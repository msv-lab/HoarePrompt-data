The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`, which is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2000\). Additionally, the function expects a parameter `P`, which is a list of \(2N\) distinct integers representing a permutation where each integer satisfies \(1 \leq P[i] \leq 2N\). 

The function is designed to process the input based on the constraints provided. However, the specific outputs or return values based on the conditions of `N` and `P` have not been detailed in your prompt. Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot specify the output. 

Nevertheless, I can summarize the expected functionality based on the input parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2000) and a list P of 2N distinct integers (1 ≤ P[i] ≤ 2N), representing a permutation.**
