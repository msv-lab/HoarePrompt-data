The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` contains [100000, c], `b` remains unchanged, and `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
