Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; if `a` contains [100000, c], `b` remains unchanged, and if `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` contains more than one element, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `fail`.***
