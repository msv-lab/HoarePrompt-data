Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` contains [100000] and possibly several elements from `P`; `b` remains [100000]; `fail` is False, indicating that no element `c` from `P` was greater than the last elements of both `a` and `b` during the iterations.***
