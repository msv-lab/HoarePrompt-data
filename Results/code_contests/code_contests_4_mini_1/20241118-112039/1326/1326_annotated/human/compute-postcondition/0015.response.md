The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables directly, but it causes the loop to skip the remaining part of its body for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Thus, the states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is a list containing [100000, c]; `c` is greater than 100000; `fail` is unaffected.
