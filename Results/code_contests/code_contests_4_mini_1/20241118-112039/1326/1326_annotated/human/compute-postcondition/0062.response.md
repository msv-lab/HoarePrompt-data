Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers. After the loop executes, if the length of `a` does not equal `N + 1`, `fail` is set to True. If `P` is empty, `a` remains [100000], `b` remains [100000], and `fail` is False. If `P` contains only one element, the loop executes once appending that element to `a`, resulting in `b` remaining [100000] and `fail` being False. Overall, `a` will contain [100000] and possibly several elements from `P`, while `b` may contain elements from `P` based on the conditions met during execution. Additionally, `fail` may be True if any element `c` from `P` is greater than the last elements of both `a` and `b` at any point during the iterations.***
