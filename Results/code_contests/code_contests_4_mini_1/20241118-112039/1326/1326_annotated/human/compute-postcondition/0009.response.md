Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers, `a` is a list that contains [100000] and possibly `c`, where `c` is the last element of `P` after the first iteration. The last element of `a` is less than `c`, and `b` is a list of integers. The variable `fail` is False.***
