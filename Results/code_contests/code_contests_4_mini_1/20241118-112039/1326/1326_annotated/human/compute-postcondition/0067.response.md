Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; if `fail` is True, then `a` may contain [100000] and several elements from `P`, `b` may contain elements from `P`, and the output is 'NO'. If `fail` is False, then `a` contains [100000] and possibly several elements from `P`, `b` remains [100000], indicating that no element `c` from `P` was greater than the last elements of both `a` and `b` during the iterations, and the output is 'YES'. Additionally, if `P` is empty, `a` and `b` will both be [100000], and `fail` will be False. If `P` contains only one element, `a` will include that element, resulting in `b` remaining [100000] and `fail` being False.***
