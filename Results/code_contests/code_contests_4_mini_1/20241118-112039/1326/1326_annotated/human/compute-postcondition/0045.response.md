Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `c` is the next element from `P` in reverse order. If the length of list `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If the length of `a` is not 1, no changes are made to `a`.***
