The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `b` is updated to include `c`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
