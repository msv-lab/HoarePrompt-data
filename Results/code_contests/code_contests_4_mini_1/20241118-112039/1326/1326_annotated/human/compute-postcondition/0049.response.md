The variable `c` is appended to the list `a`. The conditions regarding `fail` and the length of `a` do not change because we are only appending `c` to `a`. The output state does not mention any changes to `fail` or other variables, so we only note the state of `a` after the append operation. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `c` is appended to `a`.**
