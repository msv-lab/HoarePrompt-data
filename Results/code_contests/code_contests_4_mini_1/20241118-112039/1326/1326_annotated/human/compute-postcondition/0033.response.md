Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` contains [100000, c], `b` remains unchanged, and `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `a` is updated to contain [100000, c]. No changes are made to `fail`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
