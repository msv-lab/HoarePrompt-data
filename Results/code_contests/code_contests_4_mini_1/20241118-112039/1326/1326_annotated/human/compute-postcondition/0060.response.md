Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers. The list `a` contains [100000] and additional elements from `P`, and the length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`. The list `b` may contain elements from `P` based on the conditions met during execution, and `fail` will be True if any element `c` from `P` is greater than the last elements of both `a` and `b` at any point during the iterations. If `P` is empty, `a` remains [100000], `b` remains [100000], and `fail` is False. If `P` contains only one element, `a` includes that element, while `b` remains [100000] and `fail` is False.***
