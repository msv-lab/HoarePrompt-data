Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `b` may or may not have been modified; if `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` is appended to `b`. If `b` was originally empty or if `c` does not satisfy the conditions for appending, then `b` remains unchanged.**
