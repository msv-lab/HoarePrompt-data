Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers. If `c` is greater than the last element of the list `a`, and `a` contains the elements [100000, c], then `c` is appended to `a` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a` contains more than one element, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `fail`. If `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, indicating a failure condition.***
