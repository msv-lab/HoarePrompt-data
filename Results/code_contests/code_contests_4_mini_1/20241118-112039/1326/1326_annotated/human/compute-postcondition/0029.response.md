Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; if `a` initially contains only one element (100000), then `c` is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` containing [100000, c]; `b` remains unchanged; `fail` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a` contains more than one element, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `fail`.***
