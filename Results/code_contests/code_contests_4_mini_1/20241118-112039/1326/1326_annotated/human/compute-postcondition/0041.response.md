Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers. If the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `b` is smaller than `c`, then `c` is appended to `b`. If the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` but `c` is not greater than the last element of `b`, then `b` remains unchanged and `c` is appended to `a`. If the length of `b` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `c` is directly appended to `a`. Additionally, if `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, the variable `fail` is set to True, indicating a failure condition.***
