The variable `b` is assigned the value `[10 ** 5]`, which evaluates to `[100000]`. The values of `N`, `P`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is [100000]; `b` is [100000].

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is [100000]; `b` is [100000]**
