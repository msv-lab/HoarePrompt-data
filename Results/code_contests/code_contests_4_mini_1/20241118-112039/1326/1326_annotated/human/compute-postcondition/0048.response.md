Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `c` is the next element from `P` in reverse order. If the length of `a` is greater than 1 and `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` is appended to `a`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped without changing `fail`. If `c` does not satisfy the conditions for setting `fail`, no changes are made to `fail` or `a`.***
