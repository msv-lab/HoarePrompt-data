Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is a list containing [100000] and possibly `c`, where `c` is the last element of `P` after the first iteration; `b` is a list of integers; the length of `b` is less than the length of `a`, and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`. The variable `fail` remains unchanged.***
