Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers, `a` is a list that initially contains [100000]. If the length of `a` is 1, the last element `c` of `P` after the first iteration is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` being [100000, `c`]. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged. The list `b` is a list of integers, and `fail` is False.***
