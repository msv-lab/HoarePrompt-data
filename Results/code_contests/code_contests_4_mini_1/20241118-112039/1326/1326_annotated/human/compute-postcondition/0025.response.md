Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is a list containing [100000] and possibly `c`, where `c` is the last element of `P` after the first iteration; if the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`, then `b` is updated to include `c`; otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`. In both cases, `fail` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, `fail` is set to True, leading to a break in the most internal loop or if statement.***
