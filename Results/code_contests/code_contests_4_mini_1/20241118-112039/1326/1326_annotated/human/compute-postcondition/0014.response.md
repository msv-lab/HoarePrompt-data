Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is a list that contains [100000] and possibly `c`, where `c` is the last element of `P` after the first iteration; the length of `a` is 1; `c` is greater than 100000; `fail` is unaffected, and `a` becomes [100000, c].**
