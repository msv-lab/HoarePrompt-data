Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2`N` distinct integers; `a` is a list containing [100000] and possibly `c`, where `c` is the last element of `P` after the first iteration. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` is appended to `b`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `b`, `b` remains unchanged. In both cases, `fail` is unaffected by the condition. If `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
