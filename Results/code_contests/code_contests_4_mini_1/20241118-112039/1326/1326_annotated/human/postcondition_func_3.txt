The function accepts a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 2000) and a list `P` of 2N distinct integers. It attempts to distribute elements from `P` into two lists `a` and `b`, starting with `a` initialized to contain [100000]. If any element in `P` is greater than the last elements of both `a` and `b` during the distribution, a failure condition is triggered. If the final length of `a` does not equal `N + 1`, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. If `P` is empty, `a` remains [100000] and `b` remains [100000], resulting in a 'YES' output. The function does not handle the input list `P` directly, and its behavior may not align with the annotations which suggest it checks for elements greater than the last elements of `a` and `b`.
