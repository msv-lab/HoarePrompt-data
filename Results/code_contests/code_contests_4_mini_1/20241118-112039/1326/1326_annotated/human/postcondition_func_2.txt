The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers obtained by converting the input string, which is expected to be provided via the `inp()` function. The input string is split by whitespace, and the resulting elements are converted to integers. The annotations mention distinct integers from 1 to 2n, but since there are no parameters in the function, it does not enforce or validate any such constraints on the input.
