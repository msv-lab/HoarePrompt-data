To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code functions and the output hints step by step.

### Problem Description Summary:
The problem requires determining if a given permutation `p` of length `2n` can be split into two arrays `a` and `b`, each of length `n`, such that the merging of these two arrays follows the specified recursive merge procedure.

### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function simply writes the input to the standard error stream. 
   - **Output Hint Validity**: This is accurate; the function does what its description states.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads user input and returns it as an integer. If the input is not convertible to an integer, it raises a ValueError.
   - **Output Hint Validity**: This is accurate; the function performs as described.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts them into integers to form a list. It does not validate if the input is a proper permutation of integers from `1` to `2n`.
   - **Output Hint Validity**: This hint is partially valid. The function processes the input correctly, but it does not check if the input adheres to the expected criteria (distinct integers from `1` to `2n`).

4. **Function `func_4(N)`**:
   - This function processes the list `P` derived from `func_3()` and attempts to separate it into two lists `a` and `b` based on the merge rules.
   - The function begins by initializing `a` and `b` with a placeholder value `[100000]`. It then iterates through `P` in reverse.
   - It checks conditions to append elements to `a` or `b`, and sets a failure flag if an element is greater than the last elements of both lists.
   - It finally checks if the length of `a` is equal to `N + 1` to determine if it can form the required arrays.

### Edge Cases and Logic Gaps:
- The initialization of `a` and `b` with a placeholder value of `100000` is an arbitrary choice. This could cause issues if `P` contains values larger than `100000` or if all values are smaller, as it may improperly allow a violation of the merge criteria.
- If `P` is empty (though the problem guarantees it won't be), the handling would be unclear, but this is not a concern given the problem constraints.
- The function does not explicitly validate if `P` actually meets the criteria of being a permutation from `1` to `2n`, which could lead to undefined behavior if given a non-permutation.

### Output Hints Assessment:
The output hints for function 4 suggest that if any element of `P` is greater than the last elements of both lists, it will trigger a failure. This is compatible with the merging rules, but the failure condition's logic can fail to account for valid permutations in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly validate the input permutation `P`, which is crucial to determining the validity of the arrays `a` and `b`. As such, there are potential cases where the program could yield incorrect results due to the lack of validation for the permutation input, and the arbitrary choice of the initial values in `a` and `b`.

Correctness: **False**
