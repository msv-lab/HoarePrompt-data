t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) representing the length of arrays a and b. The second line of each test case contains 2n integers p_1,…,p_{2n} (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 2n), which is a permutation of length 2n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2000.
