Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` is appended to `b`. The variable `fail` may be set to True if `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`. The list `a` remains unchanged unless its length is 1 and `c` is greater than its last element, in which case `c` is appended to `a`. If the length of `a` is not 1, `a` remains unchanged. If `c` is not greater than `b[-1]`, no changes occur to `b`, `fail` remains unchanged, and `a` also remains unchanged.***
