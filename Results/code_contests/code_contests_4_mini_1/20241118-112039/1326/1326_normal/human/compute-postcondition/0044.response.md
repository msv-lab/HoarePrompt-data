The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `a` has `c` appended to it, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
