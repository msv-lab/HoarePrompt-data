Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, `b` remains a list containing the element 100000, and `fail` is False. If `len(a) == 1` and `c` is greater than the last element of `a` (which is 100000), then `c` is appended to `a`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `len(a)` is not equal to 1, the variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `fail` may be set to True in a previous iteration, which could lead to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
