Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, `b` is a list containing the element 100000, and `fail` is False. The value of `c` is greater than the last element of `b` (which is 100000).***
