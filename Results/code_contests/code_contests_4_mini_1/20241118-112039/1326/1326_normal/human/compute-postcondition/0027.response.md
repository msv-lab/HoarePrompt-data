The list `a` is modified by appending the value of `c` to it. The initial value of `a` is `[100000]`, and after the operation, it becomes `[100000, c]` where `c` is the value being appended. The values of the other variables `N`, `P`, `b`, and `fail` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the elements [100000, c], `b` is a list containing the element 100000, `fail` remains False**
