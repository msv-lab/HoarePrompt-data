The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are affected by this statement, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and `c`, `b` remains a list containing the element 100000, `fail` is False, and `c` is greater than 100000, and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop.**
