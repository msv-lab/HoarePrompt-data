Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, `b` is a list containing the element 100000, `c` is greater than `b[-1]` which is 100000, and the length of `b` is less than the length of `a`, and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`. The variable `fail` remains False unless it was set to True in a previous iteration.***
