Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, and `b` is a list containing the element 100000. If the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `b` (c) is greater than the last element of `a` (100000) then `c` is appended to `b`, making the length of `b` greater than that of `a`. Otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`, keeping `b` unchanged as [100000]. Additionally, `fail` remains False unless it was set to True in a previous iteration due to `c` being greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`. If `len(a)` is not equal to 1 or if `c` is not greater than `b[-1]`, the variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration.***
