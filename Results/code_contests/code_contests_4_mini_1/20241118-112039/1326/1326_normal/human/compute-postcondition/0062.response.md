Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `a` is a list starting with [100000] that may have values appended during loop execution, and `b` is a list starting with [100000] that may also have values appended based on conditions. If the length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, the boolean flag `fail` is set to True. If `P` is empty, `a` remains as [100000], `b` remains as [100000], and `fail` remains False. If the length of `P` is such that all elements are less than or equal to 100000, `fail` remains False, and `a` and `b` may not change. If the length of `a` equals 1, the first `c` value is appended to `a`, and `b` remains unchanged until further iterations, which could potentially lead to `fail` being set if subsequent `c` values exceed the last elements of both lists.***
