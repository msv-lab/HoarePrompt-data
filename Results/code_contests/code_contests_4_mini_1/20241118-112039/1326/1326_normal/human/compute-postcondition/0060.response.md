Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `a` is a list containing elements that are appended during the loop execution based on the conditions, starting with [100000]; `b` is a list containing elements that are also appended based on the conditions, starting with [100000]; `fail` is a boolean flag that may be set to True if any `c` encountered during the iterations is greater than both `a[-1]` and `b[-1]`. The length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, indicating that either there are more or fewer than `N + 1` elements in `a` based on the conditions during the loop execution.***
