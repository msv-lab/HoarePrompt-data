Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list that now has `c` appended to it. The variable `fail` may be True based on the conditions described, and `a` remains unchanged unless its length was 1 and `c` was greater than its last element.**
