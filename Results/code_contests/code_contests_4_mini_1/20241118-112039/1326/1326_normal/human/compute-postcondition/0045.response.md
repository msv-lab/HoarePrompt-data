Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`. If the length of `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If the length of `a` is not 1, no changes are made to `a`.***
