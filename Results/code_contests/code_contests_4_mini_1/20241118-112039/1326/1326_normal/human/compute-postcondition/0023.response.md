Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, `b` is a list containing the element 100000, and either `len(b)` is greater than or equal to `len(a)` or `b[-1]` is greater than or equal to `a[-1]`. The variable `fail` remains False unless it was set to True in a previous iteration due to `c` being greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b. The variable `c` remains unchanged. If `len(a)` is not equal to 1, the variables remain unchanged.***
