The code appends the value of `c` to the list `a`. The value of `c` is known, as it is the second last element of the list `P`. The state of the variable `a` is modified by adding the element `c`, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the list `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `a` has `c` appended to it.**
