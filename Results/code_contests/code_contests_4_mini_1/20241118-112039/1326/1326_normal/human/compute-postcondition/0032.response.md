Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, and `a` is a list that contains the elements [100000, c] if it was originally of length 1, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. `b` remains a list containing the element 100000. If `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, indicating a failure condition, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not greater than both last elements, the state of `fail`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.***
