Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000 and `c` (the last element of `P` on the first iteration) if `len(a) == 1`, `b` remains a list containing the element 100000, and `fail` is False. If `len(a)` is 1 and `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `len(a)` is not equal to 1, the variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration.***
