The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 2000. The function also accepts a parameter `P`, which is a list of 2N distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 2N. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided details, so we cannot describe specific return cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a positive integer `N` and a list `P` of 2N distinct integers within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N and a list P of 2N distinct integers, where each integer is in the range 1 to 2N.**
