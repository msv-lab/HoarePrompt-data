Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` and attempts to process a list `P` of `2N` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `2N`. It creates two lists, `a` and `b`, initially containing a single value `[100000]`. The function iterates over the elements of `P` in reverse order, attempting to append each element to either list `a` or `b` based on certain conditions. If at any point an element of `P` is greater than the last elements of both `a` and `b`, a failure condition is triggered. After processing, if the length of `a` does not equal `N + 1`, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not handle the case where `P` could be empty explicitly in the output, resulting in a potential logical gap in its behavior.**
