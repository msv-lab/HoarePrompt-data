Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, `b` is a list containing the element 100000. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, which is 100000, then `c` is appended to `b` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `c` is not greater than `b[-1]`, the variables remain unchanged and the program continues to the next iteration. Additionally, if `len(a)` is not equal to 1, the variables remain unchanged. The variable `fail` remains False unless it was set to True in a previous iteration due to `c` being greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b.***
