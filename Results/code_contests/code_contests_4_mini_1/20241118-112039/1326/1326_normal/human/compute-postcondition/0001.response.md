The variable `a` is assigned a list containing a single element, which is `10 ** 5`, resulting in `a` being `[100000]`. The other variables, `N` and `P`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, which is a list of 2`N` distinct integers in the range 1 to 2`N`; `a` is [100000].

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, which is a list of 2`N` distinct integers in the range 1 to 2`N`; `a` is [100000]**
