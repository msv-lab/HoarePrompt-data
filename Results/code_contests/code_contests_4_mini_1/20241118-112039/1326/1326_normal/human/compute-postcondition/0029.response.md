Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the elements [100000, c] if the length of `a` was originally 1, `b` remains a list containing the element 100000, and `fail` remains False; if the length of `a` was greater than 1, the state of `a`, `b`, and `fail` remains unchanged.***
