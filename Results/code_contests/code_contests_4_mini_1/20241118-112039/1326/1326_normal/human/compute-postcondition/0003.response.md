The variable `fail` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `N`, `P`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged since this line only affects `fail`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, which is a list of 2`N` distinct integers in the range 1 to 2`N`; `a` is [100000]; `b` is [100000]; `fail` is False.
