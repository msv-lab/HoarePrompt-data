Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; if `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `b` is updated to include `c`. If `a` was originally of length 1, `b` becomes [100000, c]. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `b`, the states of `fail`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, then `fail` is set to True, indicating a failure condition.***
