Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `a` is a list that may have a length equal to or not equal to `N + 1`, starting with [100000]; `b` is a list starting with [100000]; `fail` is set to True, indicating that the length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, or other conditions leading to `fail` being True have been met.***
