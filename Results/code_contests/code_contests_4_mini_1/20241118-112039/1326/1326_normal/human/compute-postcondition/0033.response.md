Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the elements [100000, c] if it was originally of length 1, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is a list containing the element 100000, and `a` is updated to include `c`.**
