Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`. If the length of `b` is less than that of `a` and `b[-1]` is less than `c`, then `c` is appended to `b`. Otherwise, if the length of `a` is 1 and `c` is greater than its last element, then `c` is appended to `a`. If the length of `a` is not 1, or if `c` is not greater than `a[-1]`, then `a` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, the variable `fail` may be set to True, but this does not affect the state of `a` or `b`.***
