Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `a` is a list starting with [100000] that may have values appended during loop execution, and `b` is a list starting with [100000] that may also have values appended based on conditions. The length of `a` is equal to `N + 1`, meaning `fail` is set to False. If `P` is not empty, `a` and `b` may have changed based on loop execution or conditions, but `fail` remains False. If the length of `P` contains elements greater than 100000, `a` and `b` may have been updated accordingly, and the first `c` value was appended to `a` if its length was 1, while `b` remains unchanged until further iterations. The state of the variables reflects that `fail` is not True and that the conditions for `a` and `b` are consistent with the constraints set by the preceding logic.***
