After executing the code snippet `a.append(c)`, the value of `c` is appended to the list `a`. The previous state of `a` contains the element 100000, and `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, which means `c` is greater than 100000. 

The list `a` will now contain two elements: 100000 and the value of `c`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and `c`, `b` remains a list containing the element 100000, `fail` is False, and `c` is greater than 100000.**
