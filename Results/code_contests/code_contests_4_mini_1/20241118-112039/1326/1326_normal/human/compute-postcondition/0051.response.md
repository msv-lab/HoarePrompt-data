Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `a`, then `c` is appended to `a` and the program continues without breaking any loop or if statement. If the length of `a` is not 1, `a` remains unchanged. The variable `fail` is not set to True unless `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`. Thus, after execution, `fail` may be True based on the conditions, and `a` will only change if its length was 1 and `c` was greater than its last element.***
