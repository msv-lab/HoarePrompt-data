Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and `c` (the last element of `P` on the first iteration) if `len(a) == 1`, `b` remains a list containing the element 100000, `fail` is False, and the program continues to the next iteration without changing any other variable states. If `len(a)` is not equal to 1, the program does not execute this block and the variables remain unchanged.***
