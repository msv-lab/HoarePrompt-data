Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing two elements, which are 100000 and `c`, `b` is a list containing one element, which is 100000, `fail` is False, `c` is the last element of `P` on the first iteration, and we continue to the next iteration without changing any variable states.**
