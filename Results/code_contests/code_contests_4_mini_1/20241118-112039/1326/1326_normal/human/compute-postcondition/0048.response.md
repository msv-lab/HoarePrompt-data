Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`. If `c` is greater than both the last element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, then `fail` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` would have been appended to `a`, but no changes occur to `a` if its length is not 1. Therefore, after the execution, `fail` may be True if the condition is satisfied, and `a` remains unchanged unless its length was 1.***
