According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `P` in reverse order. The loop variable `c` takes values from `P` starting from the last element and moving to the first. 

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the second last element of `P`. Since the loop iterates over all elements of `P`, to execute one more time, `c` needs to take the value of the last element of `P`. 

Given that `P` has `2N` distinct integers, and since `c` is currently the second last element, the last element of `P` must be used for the next iteration. Therefore, `c` needs to be adjusted to be the last element of `P`, while all other states remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the last element of `P`**
