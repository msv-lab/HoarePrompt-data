Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `b` is updated to include `c`, resulting in `b` being [100000, c] if `a` was originally of length 1; if `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, the state of `fail`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, indicating a failure condition.**
