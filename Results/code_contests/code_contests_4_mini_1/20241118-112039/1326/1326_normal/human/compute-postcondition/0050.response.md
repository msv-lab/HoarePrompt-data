Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `fail` is not set to True; `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains unchanged; the program continues without breaking out of any loop or if statement.**
