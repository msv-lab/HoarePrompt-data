The operation appends the value of `c` to the list `b`. The previous value of `b` is a list containing the element 100000. Since `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, the new value of `b` will now contain two elements: 100000 and the value of `c`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, `b` is a list containing the elements 100000 and `c`, and `fail` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, `b` is a list containing the elements 100000 and `c`, and `fail` is False**.
