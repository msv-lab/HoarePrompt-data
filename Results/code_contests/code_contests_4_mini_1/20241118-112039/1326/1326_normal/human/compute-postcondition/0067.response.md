Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `a` is a list that starts with [100000] and may have values appended during loop execution, and `b` is a list that also starts with [100000] and may change based on conditions. If `fail` is True, indicating a failure condition (such as the length of `a` not being equal to `N + 1`), 'NO' is printed. If `fail` is False, meaning the conditions for failure are not met (including `P` not being empty and the length of `a` being equal to `N + 1`), then 'YES' is printed. Additionally, if `P` is empty, `a` remains as [100000], `b` remains as [100000], and `fail` remains False. If the length of `P` results in all elements being less than or equal to 100000, `fail` remains False and `a` and `b` may not change. Overall, the output reflects the state of `fail` and the conditions of `a` and `b`.***
