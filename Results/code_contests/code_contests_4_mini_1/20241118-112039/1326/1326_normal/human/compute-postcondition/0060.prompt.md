You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is lower than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `a` is a list containing elements that are appended during the loop execution based on the conditions, starting with [100000]; `b` is a list containing elements that are also appended based on the conditions, starting with [100000]; `fail` is a boolean flag that may be set to True if any `c` encountered during the iterations is greater than both `a[-1]` and `b[-1]`. If `P` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, leaving `a` as [100000], `b` as [100000], and `fail` as False. If the length of `P` is such that all elements are less than or equal to 100000, `fail` remains False and `a` and `b` may not change. If `len(a)` is equal to 1, `a` will have the first `c` appended to it, and `b` will remain unchanged until further iterations, which could lead to `fail` being set if subsequent `c` values are greater than both last elements.
if condition:
```
if (len(a) != N + 1):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
