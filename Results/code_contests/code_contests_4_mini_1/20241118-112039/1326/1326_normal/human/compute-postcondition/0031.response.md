The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`, `a` is a list containing the elements [100000, c] if the length of `a` was originally 1, `b` remains a list containing the element 100000, `fail` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
