Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers in the range 1 to `2N`; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `a` is unchanged unless its length is 1 and `c` is greater than its last element, in which case `c` is appended to `a`. As the code appends `c` to `a`, the state of `a` changes to include `c`.**
