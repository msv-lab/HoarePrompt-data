The variable `b` is assigned the value `[10 ** 5]`, which calculates to `[100000]`. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, which is a list of 2`N` distinct integers in the range 1 to 2`N`; `a` is [100000]; `b` is [100000].
