The function accepts input from the user, processes it, and returns a list of integers parsed from that input. The input is expected to consist of distinct integers forming a permutation of integers from 1 to 2n, but the function does not validate that the input adheres to this expectation. If the input does not meet these criteria, the function may yield unexpected results or errors.
