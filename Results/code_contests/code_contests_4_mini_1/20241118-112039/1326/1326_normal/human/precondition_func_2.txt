t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) such that the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2000. The array p contains 2n distinct integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 2n), forming a permutation of integers from 1 to 2n.
