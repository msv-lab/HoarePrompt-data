To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to determine if it correctly calculates the depth of snow cover based on the heights of two adjacent towers.

The formula derived from the problem description for the depth of the snow cover \( x \) can be analyzed as follows:

1. The heights of the towers are given as:
   - West tower height \( H_a = \frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} - a \)
   - East tower height \( H_b = \frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} - b \)
   where \( n \) is the index of the respective tower.

2. The depth of the snow cover \( x \) can be computed as:
   \[
   x = H_a - H_b + (b - a)
   \]

Now let's analyze the provided program:
```python
(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

### Potential Issues:
- The program calculates the difference \( (b - a) \) and then attempts to multiply it with \( (b - a - 1) / 2 \), which resembles a triangular number calculation. However, it then subtracts \( a \) from this result, which does not align with the derived formula for snow cover \( x \).
- Specifically, the subtraction of \( a \) does not account for the relationship between the heights of the two towers properly.
- The output of the program may yield incorrect values for \( x \) since it does not follow the logical steps derived from the problem statement.

### Test Case:
Let's evaluate the provided example:
- Input: `8 13`
- Expected Output: `2`
- When we input `8 13`, the program calculates:
  \[
  (13 - 8) * (13 - 8 - 1) / 2 - 8 = 5 * 4 / 2 - 8 = 10 - 8 = 2
  \]
  This seems to give the correct output.

However, testing another input:
- Input: `54 65`
- Expected Output: `1`
- The program calculates:
  \[
  (65 - 54) * (65 - 54 - 1) / 2 - 54 = 11 * 10 / 2 - 54 = 55 - 54 = 1
  \]
  This also gives the correct output.

Despite these two examples appearing correct, the logic does not systematically apply to every potential case, particularly because it does not properly derive the height values of each tower based on their indices.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic derived from the problem statement, particularly in how it computes the snow cover depth. Thus, there are cases where the program would fail to produce the right answer.

Correctness: **False**.
