To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic it implements.

The problem requires calculating the depth of the snow cover given the heights of two adjacent towers that are partially exposed above the snow. The heights of these towers are defined by the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. The two exposed heights are given as `a` (for the west tower) and `b` (for the east tower).

### Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:
```python
(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

1. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program computes the difference between `b` and `a`, denoted as `diff = b - a`.
   - It then calculates `(diff) * (diff - 1) / 2`, which represents the sum of integers from `1` to `diff - 1`.
   - Finally, it subtracts `a` from this result to get the depth of the snow cover.

### Logical Review
To understand if the program correctly calculates the snow cover, we can derive the expected formula based on the problem statement:
- The height of the west tower can be expressed as `H_w = a + x` where `x` is the depth of the snow cover.
- The height of the east tower can be expressed as `H_e = b + x`.
- Given that the heights of the towers are defined as `H_w = 1 + ... + (w_index)` and `H_e = 1 + ... + (e_index)`, we can deduce that:
  - `b = H_e - x` and `a = H_w - x`.
  
To find `x`, we can rearrange these equations:
- `x = H_e - b`
- `x = H_w - a`

Since the heights of the towers are sums of integers, the heights can be calculated from their respective indices.

### Example Cases
Let's test the program with a known example:
- For input `8 13`:
  - Expected output is `2` because:
    - The heights of towers for `a = 8` and `b = 13` should yield a snow cover of `2`.
- For input `54 65`:
  - Expected output is `1`.

### Flaw Identification
The flaw in the provided program is that the computation of snow depth does not properly align with the geometric properties defined in the problem description. The program does not correctly derive the snow depth based on the heights of the two towers as per the mathematical formulation.

For example, letâ€™s take a case:
- Input: `1 3`
  - The expected snow depth `x` should be calculated from the heights of the towers:
    - West tower height could be `3` (1+2) - 1 = 2 (assuming the next adjacent tower).
    - East tower height could be `6` (1+2+3) - 3 = 3.
  - The expected output for snow cover should be `1`, but the program may not yield the correct output.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly account for the relationship between the heights of the towers and the snow depth. There are cases where the calculations will not yield the expected results based on the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
