The program takes two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the lengths of the uncovered parts of two adjacent towers. The goal is to calculate the depth of the snow cover based on these values. According to the problem description, the depth of snow cover should be calculated using the heights of the towers, which are based on triangular numbers.

In the provided program, the calculation is done using the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`. However, this does not correspond correctly to the mathematical relationship described in the problem. The depth of the snow cover should be the difference between the heights of the two towers minus the lengths of their uncovered parts (i.e., `depth = height_east - a = height_west - b`). 

The program does not seem to implement the correct logic for calculating the snow depth based on the problem statement. 

Furthermore, the program uses `raw_input()`, which is not compatible with newer versions of Python (it should be `input()` instead). This indicates potential input-related issues.

The output hints state that the function calculates a mathematical operation involving `b` and `a` without mentioning the proper relationship tied to the heights of the towers, which is a significant oversight.

Considering all these points:
- The program does not implement the required logic to compute the snow depth based on the given heights.
- The calculation formula used does not align with the problem description.
- The program does not validate input nor handle potential errors.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
