Given the initial state where `a` and `b` are assigned new integer values from input such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500, we analyze the provided code:

```
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

1. The expression `(b - a)` calculates the difference between `b` and `a`.
2. The expression `(b - a - 1)` calculates one less than that difference.
3. The product of these two results is then divided by 2.
4. Finally, `a` is subtracted from the result of the previous calculation.

Since `a` and `b` are specific integers within the defined range, we denote the difference as `d = b - a`. Thus, the calculation simplifies to:

```
result = (d * (d - 1)) / 2 - a
```

The value of `d` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (since `1 <= a < b` implies `b - a >= 1`).

The output state reflects the computed result but doesn't specify the exact values of `a` and `b` since they are inputs. Therefore, we conclude that the result depends on the inputs.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned integer values such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500; the result is calculated as (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a**.
