The values of `a` and `b` are now assigned new integer values obtained from `raw_input()`, which takes user input and splits it into two parts that are then converted to integers. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, but they must satisfy the condition `1 <= a < b < 499500`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` and `b` now hold these new integer values.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned new integer values from input such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500**
