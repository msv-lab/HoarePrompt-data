Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` obtained from user input, where it is assumed that `1 <= a < b < 499500`. It calculates the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`, which represents a mathematical operation involving the difference between `b` and `a`. However, the function does not return this value or handle any potential input errors, such as validating the constraints on `a` and `b` or handling cases where the input is not integers.**
