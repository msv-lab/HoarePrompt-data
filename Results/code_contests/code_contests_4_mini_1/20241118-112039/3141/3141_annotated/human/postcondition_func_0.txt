The function accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, which are read from user input. It calculates the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` and prints the result. The function does not handle cases where the input does not satisfy the condition `1 â‰¤ a < b < 499500`, and there is no validation for the input values. Additionally, the function assumes valid integer input and does not handle any potential input errors.
