To evaluate the given code snippet, we start by looking at the formula provided:

```
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

1. The expression `b - a` calculates the difference between `b` and `a`.
2. The term `(b - a - 1)` is computed next.
3. The product of `print(b - a)` and `(b - a - 1)` is taken.
4. The result of this product is then divided by `2`.
5. Finally, we subtract `a` from the result of the division.

The initial state gives us the constraints that `a` and `b` are integers, with `1 ≤ a < b < 499500`. However, since the specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only express the output in general terms.

Hence, the output state can be expressed as follows, reflecting the calculations made without specific values for `a` and `b`:

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, where 1 ≤ `a` < `b` < 499500; the result of the expression is (`b - a`) * (`b - a - 1`) / 2 - `a`.**
