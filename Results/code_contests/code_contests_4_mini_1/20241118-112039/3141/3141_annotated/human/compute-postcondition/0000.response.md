The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input, where `raw_input()` accepts two integers separated by space. Since `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a < b < 499500, the specific values of `a` and `b` will depend on the input provided. The code does not change any other variables, so the output state reflects the input values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, where 1 ≤ a < b < 499500**
