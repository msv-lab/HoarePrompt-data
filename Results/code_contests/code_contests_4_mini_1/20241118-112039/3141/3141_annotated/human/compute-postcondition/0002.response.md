The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a < b < 499500. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`, although the specific return value is not detailed in the provided output. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integers `a` and `b` that meet the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, which are integers such that 1 ≤ a < b < 499500.**
