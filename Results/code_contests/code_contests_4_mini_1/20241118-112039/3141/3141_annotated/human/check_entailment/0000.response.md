To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

The problem states that we have two adjacent towers with heights that are not covered by snow. We need to find out the depth of the snow cover based on the heights 'a' and 'b'.

The heights of the towers are given as:
- The height of the west tower = height of the west tower (not covered by snow) + depth of snow
- The height of the east tower = height of the east tower (not covered by snow) + depth of snow

From the problem description, we can derive that:
- The height of the west tower is represented by `h1 = a + x`
- The height of the east tower is represented by `h2 = b + x`
  
Since the east tower is taller than the west tower, we have:
- `h2 - h1 = b - a`

The heights of the towers are given by the formula:
- height of the west tower = 1 (for first tower) + 2 (for second tower) + ... + (n) = n(n + 1) / 2, where n corresponds to the tower number.
  
In this situation, the heights of the two adjacent towers can be represented as:
- `h1 = (n * (n + 1)) / 2` (west tower)
- `h2 = ((n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 2` (east tower)

To find the amount of snow cover (x), we need to express `x` in terms of `a` and `b`.

Let's closely analyze the function `func()`:

```python
def func():
    a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

1. The program reads two integers 'a' and 'b' from input.
2. It calculates `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` and prints the result.

The calculation seems incorrect based on the logic derived above. Specifically, the formula used to compute `x` in the code does not correctly represent the relationship between 'a', 'b', and the depth of the snow cover. 

Let's consider a simple example:
- If `a = 8` and `b = 13`, the expected output is `2`, but the formula in the code does not guarantee that we will always obtain the correct depth of snow cover in all cases because it does not properly account for the respective heights of the towers based on the triangular number sequence.

To illustrate a case where the program fails:
- For `a = 8` and `b = 13`, the expected output is `2`.
- But if we substitute these values into the formula `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`, we would not arrive at the correct snow depth.

This indicates a flaw in the logic of the code.

Thus, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
