To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the components of the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find all integer values of \( z \) (where \( z > 0 \)) for which the given equation is unsolvable in positive integers \( x \) and \( y \). The output should be the \( n \)-th such integer \( z_n \) modulo \( 1000000007 \).

### Code Breakdown:
```python
def func():
    a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203,
    2281, 3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497, 
    86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787, 1398269, 
    2976221, 3021377, 6972593, 13466917, 20996011, 24036583]
    n = input()
    print(pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Array `a`**: This array appears to contain pre-calculated values of \( z \) for \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 40 \). Each index corresponds to the \( n \)-th value of \( z \). The problem description guarantees the existence of such values for \( n \) in the specified range.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) from input, which should be in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \).

3. **Computation**: The code uses the expression:
   ```python
   pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1
   ```
   - `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7))` computes \( 2^{a[n]} \mod (2 \cdot 10^9 + 7) \).
   - The division by 2 and subtraction by 1 is intended to adjust the output value.
   - Finally, `% (10 ** 9 + 7)` computes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Integer Division**: The division `/` in Python results in a float. When you perform integer calculations, especially with modular arithmetic, you should use integer division `//` instead. This can lead to incorrect results when \( a[n] \) is not even since the result may not be an integer.

2. **Indexing**: The input value \( n \) should be converted to an integer, but the program does not ensure that the input is valid. If a user inputs a number outside the range \( [1, 40] \), it will cause an index error.

3. **Valid Input Handling**: There's no check to ensure that the input \( n \) is within the expected range. This could lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, especially regarding the potential for incorrect output caused by the use of float division and lack of input validation, the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example Case Where It Fails:
If the input is `1`, the expected output is `1`. However, due to the float division, the calculation can lead to a non-integer result before the modulo operation, which would not yield the correct integer output. If input is `41`, it will cause an index error.
