Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input an integer `n`. It then calculates and prints the value of \( \frac{2^{a[n]}}{2} - 1 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), where `a` is a predefined list of integers. However, if the input `n` is outside the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 40), the function will raise an IndexError since the list `a` only contains 40 elements indexed from 0 to 39. Therefore, it lacks proper input validation for `n`. **
