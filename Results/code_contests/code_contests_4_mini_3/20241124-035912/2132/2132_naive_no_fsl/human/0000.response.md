To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and check for potential issues.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the nth integer \( z_n \) such that the equation is unsolvable in positive integers. The output should be \( z_n \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Code Analysis:
```python
a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281, 3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497, 86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787, 1398269, 2976221, 3021377, 6972593, 13466917, 20996011, 24036583]
n = input()
print(pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Indexing**: The input `n` is read as a string, but it needs to be converted to an integer. If `n` is not cast to an integer, the program will throw an error when trying to access `a[n]` since `n` would be treated as a string index.
   
2. **Integer Division**: The expression `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1` performs a division by `2`, which results in a float in Python 3. The use of a float could lead to incorrect results when the `mod` operation is applied afterward. Instead, integer division should be used with `//` to ensure the result remains an integer.
   
3. **Potential Off-by-One Error**: The problem states that \( n \) can range from 1 to 40, but the list `a` has 41 entries (from index 0 to 40). Depending on how the input is handled, accessing `a[n]` when `n` is 1-based should actually access index `n-1` in the list.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, particularly the potential for a runtime error with improper input handling and the incorrect float division, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Therefore, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure:
If the input is `2`, the program would access `a[2]`, which is valid. However, if the input were `1`, it would access `a[1]` and there is no error, but the division issue arises. If floating-point arithmetic leads to inaccuracies, especially after the modulo operation, this can yield unexpected results. Thus, there are potential cases where the output could be incorrect.
