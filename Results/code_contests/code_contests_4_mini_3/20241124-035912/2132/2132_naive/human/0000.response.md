To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

**Problem Description**: The goal is to find the n-th integer \( z_n \) for which the given equation is unsolvable in positive integers. The outputs should be in increasing order, and we need to return \( z_n \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

**Provided Program**:
```python
a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281, 3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497, 86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787, 1398269, 2976221, 3021377, 6972593, 13466917, 20996011, 24036583]
n = input()
print(pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **List `a`**: 
   - The list contains pre-defined integer values, which presumably correspond to the unsolvable values of \( z \) for various indices.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - It reads an integer \( n \) from input. The problem guarantees \( n \) is within the range 1 to 40.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7))` computes \( 2^{a[n]} \) modulo \( 2 \times (10^9 + 7) \).
   - The expression `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1` computes half of this value minus 1.
   - The final result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Potential Issues:

1. **Indexing**: 
   - The code uses `a[n]`, but since list `a` has a zero-based index and the input \( n \) is guaranteed to be at least 1, this will access `a[n]` correctly only if \( n \) is between 1 and the length of `a`.
   - However, if \( n = 40 \) is the input, it would access `a[40]`, which does not exist in the given list (as it has indices 0 to 39). This will throw an `IndexError`.

2. **Division of Pow Output**: 
   - The expression `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1` performs a division by 2. This is not guaranteed to yield an integer result, which might also lead to incorrect results depending on the Python version (in Python 3, this results in a float).

### Conclusion:
Given these points, there is a clear case where the program does not function correctly: If \( n \) is 40, it will raise an `IndexError`, and the division may lead to floating point results instead of integers.

Correctness: **False**.
