The function reads a line of input containing four integers, splits them into a list, converts them to integers, and sorts the list. It then checks if the sum of the smallest and largest integers equals the sum of the two middle integers, or if the sum of the three smallest integers equals the largest integer. It prints 'YES' if either condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value.
