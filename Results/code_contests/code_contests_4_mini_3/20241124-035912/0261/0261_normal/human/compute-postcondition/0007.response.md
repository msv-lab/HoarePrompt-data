The code prints 'NO', and the values of the variables `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4`, and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the function prints 'NO' without altering the variables.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of integers, and the function prints 'NO'.**
