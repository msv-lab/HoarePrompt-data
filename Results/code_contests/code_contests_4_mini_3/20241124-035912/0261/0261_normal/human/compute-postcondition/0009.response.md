The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the assumption that the variables `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without specific output conditions or return values, we are unable to describe the functionality in detail.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the integers a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4, which are assumed to be within the range of 1 to 100. The return value is unspecified.**
