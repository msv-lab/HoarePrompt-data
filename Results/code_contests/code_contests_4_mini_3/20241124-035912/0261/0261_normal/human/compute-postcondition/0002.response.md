The variable `data` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that converts each string in the existing `data` list to an integer. The initial state indicates that `data` is a list of strings, and after this operation, `data` will contain integers corresponding to the original string values. Since `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100, and assuming that the values in `data` are derived from some representation of these integers, the output state will reflect that `data` now holds integer values instead of strings.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the original strings.**
