Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of integers, and it is not the case that either the sum of the first and fourth elements of `data` equals the sum of the second and third elements, or the sum of the first three elements equals the fourth element.***
