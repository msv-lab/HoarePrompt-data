Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of integers. If the sum of the smallest and largest elements in `data` equals the sum of the two middle elements, or if the sum of the three smallest elements equals the largest element, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
