You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dawid has four bags of candies. The i-th of them contains a_i candies. Also, Dawid has two friends. He wants to give each bag to one of his two friends. Is it possible to distribute the bags in such a way that each friend receives the same amount of candies in total?

Note, that you can't keep bags for yourself or throw them away, each bag should be given to one of the friends.

Input

The only line contains four integers a_1, a_2, a_3 and a_4 (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the numbers of candies in each bag.

Output

Output YES if it's possible to give the bags to Dawid's friends so that both friends receive the same amount of candies, or NO otherwise. Each character can be printed in any case (either uppercase or lowercase).

Examples

Input


1 7 11 5


Output


YES


Input


7 3 2 5


Output


NO

Note

In the first sample test, Dawid can give the first and the third bag to the first friend, and the second and the fourth bag to the second friend. This way, each friend will receive 12 candies.

In the second sample test, it's impossible to distribute the bags.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    alphabet = raw_input()
    data = alphabet.split()
    data = [int(i) for i in data]
    data.sort()
    if (data[0] + data[3] == data[1] + data[2] or data[0] + data[1] + data[2] ==
    data[3]) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is sorted. If the sum of the first and fourth elements of `data` equals the sum of the second and third elements, or if the sum of the first three elements equals the fourth element, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
