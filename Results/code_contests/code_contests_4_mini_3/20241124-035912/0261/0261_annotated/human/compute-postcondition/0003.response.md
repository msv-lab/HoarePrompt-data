The `data.sort()` method sorts the list `data` in ascending order. The variables `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this sorting operation. Since the specific contents of `data` are not provided, the output state will reflect that `data` has been sorted, while the values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain within their defined range.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is sorted**
