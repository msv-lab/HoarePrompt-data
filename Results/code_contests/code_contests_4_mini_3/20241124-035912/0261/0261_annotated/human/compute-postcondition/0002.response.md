The code snippet takes each element of the list `data`, converts it to an integer, and assigns the resulting list back to `data`. The initial state specifies that `data` is created from splitting a string called `alphabet`, but does not provide the contents of `alphabet`. Therefore, the exact values of the integers in `data` are unknown.

However, we know that the elements of `data` will now be integers. Since the initial state of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` does not directly affect the output of the code, we can state the changes based on the conversion. 

Thus, the output state will indicate that `data` now contains integers, but we cannot specify what those integers are without knowing the contents of `alphabet`. 

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is a list of integers converted from the split `alphabet` string**
