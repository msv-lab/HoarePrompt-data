Functionality: ** The function prompts the user for a space-separated string of integers, converts them into a list of integers, and sorts that list. It checks if either the sum of the smallest and largest integers equals the sum of the two middle integers, or if the sum of the three smallest integers equals the largest integer. It prints 'YES' if either condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any values. **
