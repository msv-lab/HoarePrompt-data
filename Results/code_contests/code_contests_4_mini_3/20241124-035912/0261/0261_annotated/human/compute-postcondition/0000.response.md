The variable `alphabet` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string from the user. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, a_3, and a_4 are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `alphabet` is now an input string, while the values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `alphabet` is an input string**
