The variable `data` is assigned the value of `alphabet.split()`, which splits the string `alphabet` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The previous integer values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged integer values and the new list created from the string.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is a list created from splitting `alphabet` string**
