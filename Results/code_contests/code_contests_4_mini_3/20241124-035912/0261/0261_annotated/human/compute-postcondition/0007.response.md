The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The initial state does not affect the output of this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation performed by the print function without altering the values of the integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4`, or the `data` array.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is sorted, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
