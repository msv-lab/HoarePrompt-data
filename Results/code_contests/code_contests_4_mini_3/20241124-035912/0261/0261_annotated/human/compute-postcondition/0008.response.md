Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is sorted. If the sum of the first and fourth elements of `data` equals the sum of the second and third elements, or if the sum of the first three elements equals the fourth element, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
