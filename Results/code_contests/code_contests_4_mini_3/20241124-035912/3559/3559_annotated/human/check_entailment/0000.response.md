To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to create a rectangular table of size `n Ã— m` consisting of positive integers.
- The sum of the squares of the numbers in each row and each column must also be a square.
- The values in the table must not exceed \(10^8\).

### Given Code:
```python
def func_1(x):
    if (x == 1) :
        return [1]
    else :
        if (x == 2) :
            return [3, 4]
        else :
            if (x % 2 == 1) :
                return [x / 2 + 1, 2] + [1] * (x - 2)
            else :
                return [x / 2 - 1] + [1] * (x - 1)
```

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Base Cases**:
    - If `x == 1`, it returns `[1]`. This is valid since the sum of squares (1) is a perfect square.
    - If `x == 2`, it returns `[3, 4]`. The sum of squares is \(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25\), which is also a perfect square.

2. **General Cases**:
    - For odd `x > 2`, it returns `[x / 2 + 1, 2] + [1] * (x - 2)`. 
        - For example, if `x = 3`, it would return `[3/2 + 1, 2, 1]` which evaluates to `[2.5, 2, 1]`, resulting in non-integer values which are invalid.
    - For even `x > 2`, it returns `[x / 2 - 1] + [1] * (x - 1)`.
        - For example, if `x = 4`, this would return `[4/2 - 1, 1, 1, 1]` which evaluates to `[1, 1, 1, 1]` and results in valid values.

### Edge Cases and Issues:
- The program yields invalid output for odd integers greater than 2 since it produces non-integer values.
- For example:
    - If `x = 3`, it should ideally produce a valid list of integers, but the expression results in a non-integer leading value of `2.5`.

### Conclusion:
Since there is at least one case (specifically, for any odd integer greater than 2) where the program produces invalid output (non-integer values), the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all cases.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
