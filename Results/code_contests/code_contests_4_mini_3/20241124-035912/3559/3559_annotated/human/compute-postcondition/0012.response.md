Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100, and `x` is a positive integer. If `x` is 1, the function returns the list [1]. If `x` is 2, it returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, it returns a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by 2, and then `(x - 2)` occurrences of 1. If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, it returns a list starting with `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` occurrences of 1. In all cases, the returned lists contain valid integer values, and their lengths depend on the value of `x`, ensuring they do not exceed the boundaries of the specified input conditions.***
