Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100, and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is equal to 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function returns a list that starts with `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by `2`, and then `(x - 2)` occurrences of `1`. If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, the function returns a list that starts with `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` occurrences of `1`. In all cases, the returned lists contain valid integer values, and their lengths depend on the value of `x`, ensuring they do not exceed the boundaries of the specified input conditions.***
