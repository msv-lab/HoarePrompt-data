To determine the output state, we first analyze the values of `x` based on the initial state. The variable `x` can either be 1 or 2. 

1. If `x` is 1:
   - The expression `x / 2 - 1` evaluates to `1 / 2 - 1`, which equals `0.5 - 1`, resulting in `-0.5`.
   - The expression `[1] * (x - 1)` evaluates to `[1] * (1 - 1)`, which is `[1] * 0`, resulting in an empty list `[]`.
   - Therefore, the return value when `x` is 1 will be `[-0.5] + []`, which simplifies to `[-0.5]`.

2. If `x` is 2:
   - The expression `x / 2 - 1` evaluates to `2 / 2 - 1`, which equals `1 - 1`, resulting in `0`.
   - The expression `[1] * (x - 1)` evaluates to `[1] * (2 - 1)`, which is `[1] * 1`, resulting in a list with one element, `[1]`.
   - Therefore, the return value when `x` is 2 will be `[0] + [1]`, which simplifies to `[0, 1]`.

The output state will reflect both possible outcomes based on the value of `x`.

Output State: **The program returns either [-0.5] or [0, 1]**
