Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `x`. It returns the following based on the value of `x`: [1] if `x` is 1, [3, 4] if `x` is 2, a list starting with (x / 2 + 1) followed by 2 and (x - 2) occurrences of 1 if `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, and a list starting with (x / 2 - 1) followed by (x - 1) occurrences of 1 if `x` is an even integer greater than 2. Note that the function does not handle cases when `x` is less than 1, and it does not ensure that the values returned are integers, potentially returning floats for certain cases.**
