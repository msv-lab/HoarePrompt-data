To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's break it down step by step.

### Problem Description Analysis
The task requires generating an n × m table of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of the numbers in each row and each column is also a perfect square. The constraints specify that each number in the table must not exceed \(10^8\).

### Program Analysis
The program defines a function `func_1(x)` that constructs lists based on the value of `x`:
- If `x` is 1, it returns `[1]`.
- If `x` is 2, it returns `[3, 4]`.
- If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, it returns a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by `2`, and then `1`s to fill the rest of the list.
- If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, it returns a list starting with `(x / 2 - 1)` and followed by `1`s.

The program then constructs an n × m table by multiplying the outputs of `func_1(n)` and `func_1(m)`.

### Edge Case Consideration
1. **Output Values**: The program does not ensure that the generated values do not exceed \(10^8\). For larger values of `n` and `m`, particularly when both are 100, the maximum value generated could be significant.
2. **Perfect Square Condition**: While the function generates the table, it does not check if the sum of squares of each row and column results in a perfect square. The problem does not guarantee that the output of `func_1(n)` and `func_1(m)` will meet this condition for every possible combination of `n` and `m`.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints describe the behavior of `func_1(x)` accurately. However, they also mention that the function does not handle cases where `x` is less than 1 or non-integer inputs. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the inputs were ever incorrectly formatted, though the constraints assure valid inputs.

### Conclusion
The program does not guarantee that the generated values meet the perfect square condition for the sums of rows and columns. Additionally, it doesn't enforce the upper limit constraint of \(10^8\). Therefore, it cannot be considered correct because there are scenarios (especially with larger dimensions) where the output will fail to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not ensure that the sums of the squares in each row and column are perfect squares, nor does it guarantee that all values will be within the specified limit of \(10^8\).
