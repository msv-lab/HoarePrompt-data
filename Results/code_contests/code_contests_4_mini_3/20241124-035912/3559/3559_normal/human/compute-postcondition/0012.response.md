Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. If `x` equals 1, the function returns the list [1]. If `x` equals 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd positive integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by the number 2, and then `(x - 2)` number of 1's. If `x` is an even positive integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` number of 1's. All cases ensure that the output list structure corresponds correctly to the value and parity of `x`, covering the possible range of values for `x` effectively.***
