Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and `x` is not equal to 1 or 2. If `x` is odd, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by the number 2, and then `(x - 2)` number of 1's. If `x` is even, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` number of 1's. The values in the returned list depend on whether `x` is odd or even, and all cases ensure that the list's structure is maintained according to the parity of `x`.***
