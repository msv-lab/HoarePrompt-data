Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list based on the value of `x`: it returns [1] if `x` is 1, [3, 4] if `x` is 2, a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)` followed by 2 and then `(x - 2)` number of 1's if `x` is an odd positive integer greater than 2, and a list starting with `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` number of 1's if `x` is an even positive integer greater than 2. The function does not handle cases where `x` is less than 1 or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.**
