To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the function `func_1` and the way the table is constructed.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to create a rectangular table of size `n Ã— m` filled with positive integers such that:
1. The sum of the squares of numbers in each row is a square.
2. The sum of the squares of numbers in each column is also a square.
3. Each number in the table must not exceed `10^8`.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1` is designed to create a list of integers based on the input size `x` (which represents either `n` or `m`).

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `x == 1`, it returns `[1]`.
   - If `x == 2`, it returns `[3, 4]`.

2. **Odd Dimensions** (`x % 2 == 1`):
   - It attempts to create a list where the first element is `x / 2 + 1`, the second is `2`, and the remaining elements are `1`. 

3. **Even Dimensions** (`x % 2 == 0`):
   - It returns a list starting with `x / 2 - 1` followed by `1` for the remaining elements.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Output Table**:
   - The program prints the product of the results from `func_1(n)` and `func_1(m)`, which does not guarantee that the resulting table will have the desired properties. For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 3`, it results in elements that may not fulfill the square conditions.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Sum of Squares**:
   - The row and column sums of squares are not explicitly calculated or verified. The approach used in `func_1` does not ensure that the sum of squares for both rows and columns will be squares themselves.

3. **Test Case Failure**:
   - Consider the case where `n = 3` and `m = 3`. The output will involve products that could lead to sums of squares that are not perfect squares. For example, the output could be:
     ```
     1*1 1*2 1*3
     1*1 2*2 2*3
     1*1 3*2 3*3
     ```
     which can produce rows and columns whose sums of squares are not perfect squares.

### Conclusion:
Due to the reasons outlined above, particularly the fact that the program does not guarantee that the sum of squares condition will be met, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
