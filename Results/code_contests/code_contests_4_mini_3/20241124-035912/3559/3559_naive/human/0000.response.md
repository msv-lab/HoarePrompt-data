To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the program's logic and compare it against the requirements.

### Problem Description:
- We need to create a rectangular table of size `n Ã— m` consisting of positive integers.
- The sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column must also be a square.
- Each number in the table must not exceed \( 10^8 \).

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(x)` that generates a list of integers based on the value of `x`. It handles several cases:
1. When `x` is 1, it returns `[1]`.
2. When `x` is 2, it returns `[3, 4]`.
3. When `x` is odd, it returns a list that includes one number calculated as `x / 2 + 1`, followed by `1` repeated `(x - 2)` times.
4. When `x` is even, it returns a list that includes one number calculated as `x / 2 - 1`, followed by `1` repeated `(x - 1)` times.

The main part of the program reads `n` and `m` and generates a table by multiplying the results of `func_1(n)` and `func_1(m)`.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The program needs to ensure that the resulting integers in the table meet the requirements.
- The multiplication of values from `func_1(n)` and `func_1(m)` must result in integers that satisfy the condition regarding the sums of squares.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `n = 1` and `m = 1`:** 
   - The output will be `1`, which is valid.
   
2. **Case when `n = 1` and `m = 2`:**
   - The output will be `3 4`, which is valid.

3. **Case when `n = 2` and `m = 1`:**
   - The output would be `3 3` (as `func_1(n)` returns `[3]` and `func_1(m)` returns `[1]`), which also satisfies the condition.

4. **Case when `n = 2` and `m = 2`:**
   - The result would be a 2x2 matrix formed from `[3, 4]` and `[3, 4]`, yielding:
   ```
   9 12
   12 16
   ```
   The sum of squares for both rows and columns should be checked. 
   - Row sums: 
     - First row: \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) (not a square)
     - Second row: \( 12 + 16 = 28 \) (not a square)
   - Column sums:
     - First column: \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) (not a square)
     - Second column: \( 12 + 16 = 28 \) (not a square)
   
Since the sums of squares from the generated numbers do not yield a perfect square for all rows and columns, it shows that the program does not meet the requirement of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the requirement for generating a table where the sum of squares of rows and columns is a square.

Correctness: **False**.
