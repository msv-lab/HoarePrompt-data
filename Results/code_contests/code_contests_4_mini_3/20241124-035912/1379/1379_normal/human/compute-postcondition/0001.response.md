The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `v` and `u`. The parameter `v` is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, which indicates the number of circles. The parameters `u` consist of tuples representing the circles, where each tuple contains three integers: `x`, `y`, and `r`. The integers `x` and `y` are in the range -10 to 10, and `r` is in the range 1 to 10, representing the center coordinates and radius of the circles respectively. 

Based on the output conditions, the function checks for specific cases:
- Case_1: If `n` is equal to 1, it processes the first circle and returns a specific result related to it.
- Case_2: If `n` is equal to 2, it processes the first and second circles and returns a result that may involve both.
- Case_3: If `n` is equal to 3, it processes three circles and returns a result based on all three.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `n` representing the number of circles and a tuple `u` containing the circle parameters `(x, y, r)`, and return results based on the number of circles specified by `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a tuple of circle parameters `(x, y, r)` for each circle, returning results based on the number of circles specified.**
