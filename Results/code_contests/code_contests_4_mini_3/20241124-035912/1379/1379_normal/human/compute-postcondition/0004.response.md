The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `v`. `v` is an integer that is part of a list or array `par`. The behavior of the function depends on the value of `par[v]` and whether it is equal to `v` or not. After executing the function, it returns the value of `par[v]`, which may have been updated based on the initial comparison of `par[v]` and `v`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept an integer `v` and return the value of `par[v]` potentially after an update based on its comparison with `v`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter v and returns the value of par[v], which may be updated based on whether par[v] was equal to v or not.**
