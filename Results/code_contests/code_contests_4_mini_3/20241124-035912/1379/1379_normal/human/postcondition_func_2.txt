The function accepts two parameters `v` and `u`, calls a function `func_2` with each of these parameters, and assigns the result of `func_2(u)` to a dictionary index determined by the result of `func_2(v)`. The function does not return any value, and the behavior depends on the implementation of `func_2`, which is not provided. There are no checks for the validity of `v` and `u`, nor any handling for potential exceptions that may arise from the operations performed, such as if `func_2(v)` results in an invalid index for the dictionary.
