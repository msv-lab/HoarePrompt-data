The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `v`. `v` is an integer that corresponds to an index in a list `par`. The function returns the value of `par[v]`, which may have been updated based on the condition that `par[v]` is not equal to `v`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `v` and return the value at the index `v` in the list `par`, potentially reflecting any updates made to that value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter v and returns the value of par[v], which may have been updated based on whether par[v] is not equal to v.**
