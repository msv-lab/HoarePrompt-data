The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `v` and `u`. The parameter `v` is an integer that represents the number of circles, constrained such that 1 ≤ v ≤ 3. The parameters `u` consists of three tuples, where each tuple contains three integers: `x`, `y`, and `r`. The integers `x` and `y` are constrained in the range -10 to 10, and the integer `r` is constrained such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 10. Based on the values of these parameters, the function returns a specific output, although the exact nature of that output is not defined in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `v` representing the number of circles (1 to 3) and a tuple `u` containing details of circles (x, y, r) with specific integer constraints; it returns a result based on these inputs.**
