The function accepts an integer parameter `v` and recursively updates `par[v]` to its parent value until it finds a value that is equal to its own index. It then returns the final value of `par[v]`, which represents the root parent in a union-find structure. The function does not handle cases where `par` is not defined for the input `v`, which could lead to an error if `v` is out of bounds.
