Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 0, `vis` is a dictionary that now contains the key `i` with a value of 0, where `i` is the first element of `arr`. If `freq[i]` is not 0, then `vis` remains unchanged.***
