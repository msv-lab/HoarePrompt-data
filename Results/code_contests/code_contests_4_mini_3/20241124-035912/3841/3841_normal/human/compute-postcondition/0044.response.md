The value of `ans` is incremented by `rem`. Since `rem` remains unchanged based on the initial state conditions, the value of `ans` increases by the current value of `rem`. The other variables (`vis[i]`, `freq[i]`, and `rem`) remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged condition of `vis[i]`, `freq[i]`, and the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`vis[i]` is false for the next element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is decreased by 1, `rem` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
