The value of `vis[i]` is updated to `1`, indicating that the integer `i` is now marked as visited. The values of the other variables (`freq`, `rem`, `ans`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `freq` is updated for the integer `i`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` initialized to 0, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is `ans + rem`, and `vis[i]` is now 1.

Output State: **`freq` is updated for the integer `i`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` initialized to 0, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is `ans + rem`, and `vis[i]` is now 1**
