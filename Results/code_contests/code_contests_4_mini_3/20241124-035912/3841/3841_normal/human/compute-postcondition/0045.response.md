The value of `vis[i]` is assigned `1`, changing its previous state from `false` to `1`. The other variables `freq[i]`, `rem`, and `ans` are unaffected based on the given initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `vis[i]`.

Output State: **`vis[i]` is 1, `freq[i]` is decreased by 1, `rem` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `rem`**.
