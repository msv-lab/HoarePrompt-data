The line of code `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` assigns a value to `freq[i]`. The `get` method of the dictionary `freq` checks if the key `i` exists in the dictionary. If it does, it retrieves its value; if it does not, it returns `0`. Since `freq` is initially an empty dictionary, `freq.get(i, 0)` will return `0`. Thus, `freq[i]` will be assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` is {i: 0}, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
