The code `freq[i] += 1` increments the count of `i` in the `freq` dictionary by 1. The variable `i` corresponds to the first element of the `arr` list. Prior to this operation, `freq[i]` was 0 as stated in the initial state. Therefore, after executing the code, `freq[i]` will be 1. The state of `vis` remains unchanged since the condition regarding `freq[i]` being not equal to 0 does not affect its current values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` now contains the key `i` with a value of 1, `vis` remains unchanged with the key `i` and value 0**.
