The value of `rem` is decremented by 1, while the other variables (`vis[i]`, `ans`, and `freq[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `rem`. 

Output State: **`vis[i]` is false for the next element in `arr`, `ans` remains unchanged, `freq[i]` is decreased by 1, `rem` is decremented by 1**
