The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. The specific value of `freq[i]` is not provided, but it is implied that it is a count of occurrences for the integer `i` in the array `arr`. The other variables `vis`, `rem`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `freq` is updated for the integer `i`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` initialized to 0, `rem` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, and `i` is the first integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`freq` is updated for the integer `i`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` initialized to 0, `rem` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, and `i` is the first integer in `arr`**
