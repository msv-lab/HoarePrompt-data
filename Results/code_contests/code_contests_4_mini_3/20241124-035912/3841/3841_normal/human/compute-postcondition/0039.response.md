Postcondition: ***If `vis[i]` is false, `ans` is increased by `rem`, `vis[i]` is set to 1, and `freq[i]` is decremented by 1, leading to a decrease in `rem` if `freq[i]` was originally greater than 0; if `freq[i]` was 0, `rem` remains unchanged. If `vis[i]` was already true, `ans`, `vis`, and `rem` remain unchanged.***
