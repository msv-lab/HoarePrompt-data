The code `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` uses the `get` method to retrieve the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `freq`. If `i` is not found in `freq`, it returns `0`. 

In the initial state, `freq[i]` is stated to be `2`, which means that `i` is already a key in `freq` with a value of `2`. Thus, `freq.get(i, 0)` will return `2`, and `freq[i]` will remain `2`. 

Other variables including `n`, `arr`, `vis[i]`, and the value of `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 2, `vis[i]` is 0, and `i` is the next element in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 2, `vis[i]` is 0, and `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
