The code assigns the value 0 to the key `i` in the dictionary `vis`. The previous value of `i` is the first element of `arr`, and since `freq[i]` is 0, it confirms that `i` has not been counted yet. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 0, `vis` now contains `i` with a value of 0, and `i` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 0, `vis` now contains `i` with a value of 0, and `i` is the first element of `arr**
