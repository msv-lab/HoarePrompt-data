According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more element in `arr` that has not been processed yet. 

At the end of the last iteration, `vis[i]` remains unchanged at 0, implying that `i` refers to the last element in the list that was processed. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to refer to the next element in the list, and `arr` must still contain elements to iterate over.

Since `freq[i]` is given as 3, this indicates that the current element `i` has been processed 3 times or has a frequency of 3. However, the key point is that the loop should continue until all elements in `arr` have been processed.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that the loop can continue with the next element, which means `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr` and we need to ensure that `arr` has not been fully iterated.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 3, `vis[i]` remains unchanged at 0, and `i` is the next integer in `arr`**
