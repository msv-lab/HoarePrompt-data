The code initializes `freq` as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the values of `n` or `arr`, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `arr` is a list of integers based on input values; `freq` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `arr` is a list of integers based on input values; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**
