According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` contains at least one integer, the loop will execute for each integer in `arr`. Since `rem` is initialized to the length of the set of `arr`, it should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to the first integer in `arr`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must contain at least 1 integer, `rem` should be greater than 0, and `i` should be the first integer in `arr`.

State: **`freq` contains the counts of each integer in `arr`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` initialized to 0, `rem` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first integer in `arr`**
