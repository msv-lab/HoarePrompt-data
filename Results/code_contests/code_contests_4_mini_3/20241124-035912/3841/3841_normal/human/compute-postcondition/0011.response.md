The code assigns the value of `freq[i]` to `freq.get(i, 0)`. The `get` method checks if the key `i` exists in the `freq` dictionary; if it does, it retrieves its current value, which is 1. If the key does not exist, it would return 0 instead. Since `freq` already contains the key `i` with a value of 1, `freq[i]` will be assigned this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` now contains the key `i` with a value of 1, `vis` remains unchanged with the key `i` and value 0, and `i` is the next integer in the list `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` now contains the key `i` with a value of 1, `vis` remains unchanged with the key `i` and value 0, `i` is the next integer in the list `arr`.**
