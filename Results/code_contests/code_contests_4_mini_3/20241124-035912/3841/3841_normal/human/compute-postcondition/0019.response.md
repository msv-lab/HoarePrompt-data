The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 2, so after execution, `freq[i]` becomes 3. Other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `vis[i]`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis[i]` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis[i]` remains unchanged at 0**
