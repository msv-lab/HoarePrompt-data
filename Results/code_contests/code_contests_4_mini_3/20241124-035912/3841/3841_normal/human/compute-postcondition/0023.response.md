The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables `freq`, `vis`, and `rem` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the initialization of `ans`.

Output State: **`freq` contains the counts of each integer in `arr`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` initialized to 0, `rem` is the length of the set of `arr`, which is 0 if `arr` is empty; `ans` is 0**
