The code initializes `vis` as an empty dictionary. The previous values of `n`, `arr`, and `freq` are unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables while indicating the new initialization of `vis`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `arr` is a list of integers based on input values; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `vis` is an empty dictionary.**
