The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `freq` contains the key `i` with a value of 1, after the execution, `freq[i]` will be 2. The value of `vis[i]` remains unchanged at 0 because the condition regarding its presence was not triggered. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is 0**
