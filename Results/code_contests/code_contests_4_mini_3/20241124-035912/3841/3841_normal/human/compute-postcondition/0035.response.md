The code `rem -= 1` decrements the value of `rem` by 1. The initial state indicates that `freq[i]` has been decremented by 1, affecting the count of the integer `i` in `freq`, while `vis`, `rem`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `rem`. The values of `vis`, `freq`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `rem` is updated to its previous value minus 1, `vis` is unchanged, and `ans` is unchanged.**
