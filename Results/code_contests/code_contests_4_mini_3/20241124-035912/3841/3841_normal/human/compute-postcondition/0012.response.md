The statement `vis[i] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the key `i` in the dictionary `vis`. Since `vis` already contains the key `i` with a value of 0, this assignment does not change the state of `vis`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `freq` remain unchanged as well. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` contains the key `i` with a value of 1, `vis` has the key `i` with value 0, and the value of `vis[i]` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` contains the key `i` with a value of 1, `vis` has the key `i` with value 0**
