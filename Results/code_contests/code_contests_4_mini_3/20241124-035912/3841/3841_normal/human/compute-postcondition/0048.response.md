Output State: **`freq` is updated for each integer in `arr`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr`, initialized to 0, `rem` is the number of unique integers in `arr` that have not been fully processed, and `ans` is the sum of the remaining unique integers encountered. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `freq` unchanged, `vis` unchanged, `rem` as 0, and `ans` as 0. If `arr` contains only unique elements, `rem` will decrease as their frequencies reach zero, and `ans` will increase accordingly for each new unique integer encountered.`**
