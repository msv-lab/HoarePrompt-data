The code assigns the value `0` to `vis[i]`. The value of `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `vis[i]` was previously `0`, so it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 2, `vis[i]` is 0 (remains unchanged), and we assign `vis[i]` as 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq[i]` is 2, `vis[i]` is 0 (remains unchanged)**
