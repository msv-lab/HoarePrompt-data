The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 100,000 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). `arr` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies the condition that they are between 1 and 100,000 (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5). The function does not return any specific output in the provided information, so we cannot determine a return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of integers arr, where n indicates the number of elements in arr.**
