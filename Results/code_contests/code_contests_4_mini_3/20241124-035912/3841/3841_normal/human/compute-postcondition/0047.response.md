To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and the provided information.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over `arr`, which means `i` will take on each value in `arr` sequentially.
  
2. **State Analysis**: 
   - The end of the previous iteration mentions `vis[i]` is false for the next element in `arr`. This means that the loop is currently at an index where `vis[i]` is still false, indicating that the current element has not been visited yet.
   - `ans` is increased by `rem` if `vis[i]` is set to 1 after execution, suggesting that during the last iteration, `vis[i]` could have been set to true (1) for the current `i`.
   - `freq[i]` is decreased by 1, and the impact on `rem` is dependent on whether `freq[i]` was zero before the last execution.

3. **Next Iteration Preparation**: 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it will need to go to the next element in `arr`. The next `i` will be the next index in the `arr`.
   - The state of `vis[i]` would need to be false for this next element as well, indicating it hasn't been visited yet.
   - The `ans` will remain unchanged unless `rem` is modified, which depends on the frequency of the previous element in `arr`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The index `i` needs to be incremented to point to the next element in `arr`.
   - The state of `vis[i]` should still be false for the next element.
   - Since `freq[i]` was decreased by 1, it needs to reflect accurately according to the next index.
   - The value of `rem` will depend on the state of `freq` for the new `i`.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`vis[i]` is false for the next element in `arr`, `ans` remains unchanged, `freq[i]` is the adjusted frequency for the new `i`, `rem` is decremented if the previous `freq` was zero, else it remains unchanged.**
