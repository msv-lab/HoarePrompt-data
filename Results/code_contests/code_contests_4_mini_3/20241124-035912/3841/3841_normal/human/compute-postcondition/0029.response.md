Postcondition: ***`freq` is updated for the integer `i`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` initialized to 0, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is 0, and `vis[i]` is false, indicating that the integer `i` is not yet visited. If `freq[i]` was equal to 0, then `rem` has been decreased by 1, indicating that a new unique integer has been encountered. If `freq[i]` was not equal to 0, then `rem` remains unchanged.***
