The variable `arr` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `raw_input()`, which is split into separate string elements. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, and `arr` will be populated based on the input provided. Since the specific input values are not given, we can only describe the expected output state in general terms.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `arr` is a list of integers based on input values, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5**
