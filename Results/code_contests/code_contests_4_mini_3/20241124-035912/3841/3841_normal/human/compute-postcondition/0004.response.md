According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the `arr` list. For the loop to execute, the `arr` list must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is a positive integer, we can assume that `arr` has been populated based on the input values, and we must ensure that it is non-empty. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will hold the last value from `arr`, but since we are looking at the state before the loop starts, `i` should be prepared to take on the first value of `arr`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty, and we can set `i` to the first element of `arr` in anticipation of the loop executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
