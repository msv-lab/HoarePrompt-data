Postcondition: ***`freq` is updated for the integer `i`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` initialized to 0, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is updated. If `vis[i]` was initially 0, then `ans` is increased by `rem`, and `vis[i]` is set to 1, indicating that a new unique integer has been encountered. If `vis[i]` was already 1, no changes are made to `ans` or `vis`.***
