The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. It counts the frequency of each integer in `arr` and calculates a value `ans`, which represents the cumulative count of unique integers remaining as each unique integer is processed. The result is printed as the output. If `arr` is empty, the output will be 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
