The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `freq[i]` is not specified, but it indicates that `freq` contains updated counts for unique integers. The other variables `vis`, `rem`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `i` points to the next index in `arr`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `freq` and the unchanged states of the other variables. 

Output State: **`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` indicates that the integer at index `i` was previously visited, `rem` is unchanged, `arr` has one more unique integer to iterate over, and `freq[i]` is decremented by 1.**
