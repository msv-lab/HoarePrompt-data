According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `arr` list. Since `n` is a positive integer, it implies that `arr` must contain at least `n` elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). However, the size of `arr` is not explicitly mentioned; it could contain fewer than `n` elements. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states as follows:
1. The `arr` must be non-empty for the loop to execute.
2. `i` should be the first element of `arr` during the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to be executed properly, we require that `arr` is a list with at least 1 integer, and `i` is set to the first element of `arr`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
