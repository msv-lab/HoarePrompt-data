The statement `vis[i] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `i` in the dictionary `vis`. Initially, `vis` is an empty dictionary, so after execution, `vis` will contain the key `i` with the value `0`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `freq`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 0, `vis` is {i: 0}, and the frequency of `i` is not greater than 0.**
