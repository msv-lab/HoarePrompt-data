According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop will execute for each element in `arr`. Given that `rem` is 0 if `arr` is empty, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must contain at least 1 element. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to the first element in `arr`. 

State: **`freq` contains the frequency counts of all unique integers in `arr`, `vis` contains keys for all unique integers in `arr` with a value of 0, `rem` is 0 if `arr` is empty, `ans` is initialized to 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`, and `arr` has at least 1 element**
