The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `freq[i]` is 2, after execution, `freq[i]` becomes 3. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `i`, and `vis[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis[i]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis[i]` is 0**
