Postcondition: ***`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` indicates that the integer at index `i` was previously visited, and `rem` remains unchanged if `freq[i]` is greater than 0; if `freq[i]` is equal to 0, then `rem` is decremented by 1. If `vis[i]` was previously 0 (i.e., not visited), `ans` is increased by the value of `rem` and `vis[i]` is set to 1, indicating that the integer at index `i` has now been marked as visited. If `vis[i]` was already 1, no changes are made to `ans` or `vis[i]`.***
