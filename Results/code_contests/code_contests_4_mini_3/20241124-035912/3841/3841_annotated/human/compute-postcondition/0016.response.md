The code assigns `freq[i]` the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`. The `get` method checks if the key `i` exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it returns the value associated with that key; if it does not exist, it returns 0. In this case, since `freq[i]` is already 2, the result of `freq.get(i, 0)` will be 2. Therefore, `freq[i]` will remain 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is 0**
