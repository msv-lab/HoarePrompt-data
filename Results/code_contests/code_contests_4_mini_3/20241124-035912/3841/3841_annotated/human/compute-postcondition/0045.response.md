The variable `vis[i]` is updated to 1, indicating that the integer at index `i` has now been visited. The previous state of `freq`, `rem`, and `ans` remains unchanged since the code only modifies `vis[i]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the update made to `vis`.

Output State: **`freq` has been updated with `freq[i]` decreased by 1, `vis[i]` is now 1 for the newly visited integer, `rem` is decremented by 1 if `freq[i]` was previously greater than 0; otherwise, `rem` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `rem`, and `vis[i]` is updated to 1.**
