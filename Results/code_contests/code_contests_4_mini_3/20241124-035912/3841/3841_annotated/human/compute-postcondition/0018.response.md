Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is 0. If `freq[i]` is 0, then `vis[i]` remains 0. Since `freq[i]` is 2, the condition evaluates as false, thus leaving `vis[i]` unchanged at 0. Therefore, after execution, `vis[i]` remains 0.***
