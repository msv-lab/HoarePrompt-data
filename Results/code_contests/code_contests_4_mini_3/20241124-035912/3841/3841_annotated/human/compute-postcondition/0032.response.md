Postcondition: ***`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` indicates whether the integer at index `i` has been visited, `rem` is decremented by 1 if `freq[i]` was zero, reflecting the count of unique integers no longer present. If `vis[i]` was false before the execution, `ans` is updated to `ans + rem`, and `vis[i]` is set to true. If `vis[i]` was already true, the values of `ans`, `vis`, `freq`, and `rem` remain unchanged.***
