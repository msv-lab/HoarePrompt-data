The code calculates the number of unique integers in `arr` by using `len(set(arr))`. If `arr` is empty, `set(arr)` will also be an empty set, resulting in a length of 0. Thus, `rem` will be assigned the value 0. The state of `freq` and `vis` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`freq` contains the frequency counts of all unique integers in `arr`, `vis` contains keys for all unique integers in `arr` with a value of 0, and `rem` is 0 if `arr` is empty.**
