The line `vis[i] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `i` in the dictionary `vis`. Since `vis` already includes the key `i` with a value of `0`, this assignment does not change its value. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `vis[i]` remains `0`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis[i]` remains 0**.
