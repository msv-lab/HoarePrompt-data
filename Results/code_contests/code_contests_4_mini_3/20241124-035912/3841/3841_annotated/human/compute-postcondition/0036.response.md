Postcondition: ***`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` indicates that the integer at index `i` was previously visited, and `rem` remains unchanged if `freq[i]` is greater than 0. If `freq[i]` is equal to 0, then `rem` is decremented by 1, indicating that there is one less unique integer to iterate over.***
