Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 0. If the frequency of `i` is not greater than 0, then `vis` will include the key `i` with a value of 0, while `freq[i]` remains 0.***
