The code assigns the value `0` to `vis[i]`. In the initial state, `vis[i]` was already `0`, so there is no change in the value of `vis[i]`. The values of other variables `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `freq[i]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `vis[i]` and the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is 0**
