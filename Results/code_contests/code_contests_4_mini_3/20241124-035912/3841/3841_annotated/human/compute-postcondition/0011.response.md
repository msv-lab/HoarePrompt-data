The variable `freq[i]` is assigned the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`. The method `get` checks the dictionary `freq` for the key `i`. If `i` is present, it returns its value; if not, it returns `0`. Given that `freq[i]` is initially `1`, it remains `1` after the execution of this line. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis` includes the key `i` with a value of 0.
