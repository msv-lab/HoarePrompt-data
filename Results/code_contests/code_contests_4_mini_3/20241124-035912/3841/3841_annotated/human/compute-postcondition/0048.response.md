Output State: **If `arr` is not empty, `freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` indicates whether each integer in `arr` has been visited, `rem` reflects the count of unique integers that have been visited and are no longer present (decremented when `freq[i]` reaches zero), and `ans` accumulates the count of unique integers no longer present when a new unique integer is visited. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, `freq` remains unchanged, `vis` remains unchanged, `rem` is 0, and `ans` is still 0.**
