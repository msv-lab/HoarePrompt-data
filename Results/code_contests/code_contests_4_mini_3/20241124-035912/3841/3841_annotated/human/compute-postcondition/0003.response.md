The code initializes a variable `vis` as an empty dictionary. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `freq` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `arr` is a list of integers; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `vis` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `arr` is a list of integers; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `vis` is an empty dictionary**
