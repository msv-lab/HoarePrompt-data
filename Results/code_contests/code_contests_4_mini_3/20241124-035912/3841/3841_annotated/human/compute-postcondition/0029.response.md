Postcondition: ***`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` contains keys for unique integers in `arr` with a value of 0, `rem` is decremented by 1 if `freq[i]` is zero, indicating that the count for the integer at index `i` has reached zero. If `freq[i]` was already zero, `rem` is reduced from its previous value, which could be positive or zero. `ans` remains 0, `i` is still the first element in `arr`, and `vis[i]` is false (indicating that the integer represented by `i` has not been visited).***
