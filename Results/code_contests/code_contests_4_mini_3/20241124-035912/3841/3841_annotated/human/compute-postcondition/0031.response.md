The value of `vis[i]` is updated to 1, changing its previous value from false to true. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers; `vis[i]` is true; `rem` is decremented by 1 if `freq[i]` is zero; `ans` is updated to `ans + rem`; `i` is still the first element in `arr`.**
