Postcondition: ***`freq` has been updated with `freq[i]` decreased by 1, `vis[i]` is now 1 for the newly visited integer, and `rem` is decremented by 1 if `freq[i]` was previously greater than 0; otherwise, `rem` remains unchanged. The variable `ans` is updated by adding `rem`, and `vis[i]` is set to 1. If `vis[i]` was already 1, no modifications to `ans`, `vis`, or `rem` occur.***
