Postcondition: ***`freq` has been updated with `freq[i]` decreased by 1, `vis` is updated such that `vis[i]` is now 1 for the newly visited integer, `rem` is decremented by 1 if `freq[i]` was previously greater than 0; otherwise, `rem` remains unchanged. The variable `ans` is updated accordingly based on these changes.***
