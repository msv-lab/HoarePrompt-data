The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, and `arr` is a list of integers where each integer in the list satisfies the condition of being between 1 and 100,000. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the given conditions. However, the specific output and cases based on the input parameters have not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`, conforming to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a list of integers arr (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100,000).**
