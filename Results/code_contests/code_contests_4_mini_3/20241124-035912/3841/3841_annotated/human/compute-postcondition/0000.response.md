The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string, and `int` converts that string to an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the values of `n` and the fact that `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100,000**
