The code snippet `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` assigns a value to `freq[i]`. The `get` method attempts to retrieve the value associated with the key `i` in the `freq` dictionary. If `i` is not found, it returns `0`. Since `freq` is initially an empty dictionary, the `get` method will return `0`. Therefore, `freq[i]` is assigned the value `0`.

The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `i`, `vis`) remain unaffected by this operation. The output state reflects the new state of the `freq` dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is {i: 0}, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
