The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `freq[i]` initially has a value of 0, after execution, `freq[i]` will be 1. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `i`, and `vis`) remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis` still includes the key `i` with a value of 0.
