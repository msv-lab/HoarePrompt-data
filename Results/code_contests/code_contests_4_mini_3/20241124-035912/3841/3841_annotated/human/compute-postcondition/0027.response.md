The value of `rem` is decremented by 1. Since `rem` is initially 0 (if `arr` is empty), decrementing it results in `rem` becoming -1. The other variables (`freq`, `vis`, `ans`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` contains keys for unique integers in `arr` with a value of 0, `rem` is -1, `ans` is 0, and `i` is the first element in `arr`.

Output State: **`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` contains keys for unique integers in `arr` with a value of 0, `rem` is -1, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
