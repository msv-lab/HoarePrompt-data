The line `freq[i] -= 1` decreases the count of the integer at index `i` in the `freq` list by 1. This operation does not affect `vis`, `rem`, or `ans` directly, but it implies that the frequency of the specific integer represented by `i` has been updated.

Given that `freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, the specific effect on `freq[i]` depends on its prior value. However, since we do not know the specific value prior to the operation, we can only state that the frequency count for the integer at index `i` has been decremented.

The output state reflects that `freq` has been updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`freq` has been updated with freq[i] decreased by 1, `vis` is updated such that `vis[i]` is now 1 for the newly visited integer, `rem` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated accordingly**.
