The code sets `vis[i]` to 1, indicating that the integer at index `i` has been marked as visited. The initial state does not change any of the other variables (`freq`, `rem`, `ans`), so their values remain as they were. Therefore, the output state reflects that the integer at index `i` is now marked as visited.

Output State: **`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` indicates that the integer at index `i` was previously visited, `rem` is decremented by 1 if `freq[i]` is equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by the value of `rem`; `vis[i]` is set to 1.**
