The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `freq[i]` is not specified, but it must be greater than 0 since `i` is a key in `freq` corresponding to an element in `arr`, which has at least one occurrence. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` contains keys for unique integers in `arr` with a value of 0, `rem` is 0 if `arr` is empty, `ans` is initialized to 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`freq` contains updated counts for unique integers, `vis` contains keys for unique integers in `arr` with a value of 0, `rem` is 0 if `arr` is empty, `ans` is initialized to 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is decremented by 1**
