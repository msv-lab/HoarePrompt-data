The code initializes an empty dictionary `freq`, which will be used to store frequencies of the integers in the list `arr`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the state of `n` and `arr` remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `arr` is a list of integers, and `freq` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `arr` is a list of integers; `freq` is an empty dictionary**
