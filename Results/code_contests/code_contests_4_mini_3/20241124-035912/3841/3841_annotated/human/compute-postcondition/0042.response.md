The variable `rem` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `rem` is unknown. The other variables (`freq`, `vis`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `rem`.

Output State: **`freq` has been updated with freq[i] decreased by 1, `vis` is updated such that `vis[i]` is now 1 for the newly visited integer, `rem` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is updated accordingly**.
