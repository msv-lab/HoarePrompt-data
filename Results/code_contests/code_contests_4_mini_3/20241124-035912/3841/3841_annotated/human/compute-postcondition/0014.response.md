The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `freq[i]` was initially 1, after this operation, `freq[i]` will be 2. The variable `vis[i]` retains its previous value of 0 because `freq[i]` is not 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is 0**
