The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. It calculates the number of unique integers in `arr` that were no longer present (counted as `rem`) when each unique integer was first visited, and outputs this count as `ans`. If `arr` is empty, the function will output 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
