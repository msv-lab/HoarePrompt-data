Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `y1` is `A * cos(-t1)`; `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`; `y2` is `b * cos(-t2)`; the output is the result of the expression `((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5` which represents the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).**
