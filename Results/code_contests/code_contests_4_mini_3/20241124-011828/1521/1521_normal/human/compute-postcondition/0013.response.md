The function `func` accepts parameters `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M`. `A` and `B` are integers between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, and `M` is an integer between 0 and 59. The function does not return any specific output in the description provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M` with specified constraints, but the return value is not detailed.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters A and B (integers between 1 and 1000), H (integer between 0 and 11), and M (integer between 0 and 59), but does not specify a return value.**
