The variable `x2` is assigned the value of `-b * sin(-t2)`. The values of `b` and `t2` are not specified in the initial state, so their impact on `x2` cannot be determined. However, the initial state mentions that `A` is between 1 and 1000 and that `y1` is `A * cos(-t1)`, but these variables do not affect `x2`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x2` is calculated based on `b` and `t2`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `y1` is `A * cos(-t1)`; `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`**
