To determine the output state, we first analyze the given code snippet and the initial state of the variables. 

- The initial state specifies that `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M` are integers within specified ranges, and `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values from input split into integers. The specific values of `h` and `m` are important as they will be used in the computation for `t1`.

- The code calculates `t1` using the expression `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`. The term `h % 12` ensures that `h` is expressed in terms of a 12-hour clock. The multiplication by `30` converts the hour into degrees (since each hour represents 30 degrees on a clock face). The `m * 0.5` term accounts for the additional degrees contributed by the minutes (each minute contributes 0.5 degrees).

Since we do not have the specific values of `h` and `m`, we will express `t1` in terms of these values.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the ranges of `A`, `B`, `H`, `M`, and the calculated value of `t1` based on the values of `h` and `m`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59; `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)**
