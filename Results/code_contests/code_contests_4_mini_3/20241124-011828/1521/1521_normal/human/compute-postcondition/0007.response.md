The variable `t2` is assigned the value `radians(m % 60 * 6)`. Here, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, so `m % 60` will simply be `m`. Therefore, `t2` will calculate to `radians(m * 6)`. The value of `t2` depends on the specific value of `m`, which is not specified in the initial state. However, the other variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: `A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59, and `t2` is `radians(m * 6)`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59, and `t2` is `radians(m * 6)`**
