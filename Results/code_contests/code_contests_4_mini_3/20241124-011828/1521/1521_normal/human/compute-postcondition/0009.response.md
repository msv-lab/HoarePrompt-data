The variable `y1` is assigned the value of `A * cos(-t1)`. The initial state provides that `A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but the exact value is not specified. The variable `t1` can be derived from the initial conditions but is not explicitly given. Thus, `cos(-t1)` will depend on the value of `t1`, which is unknown.

Since we do not have the specific values for `A` or `t1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `y1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship established by the code.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `y1` is `A * cos(-t1)`**
