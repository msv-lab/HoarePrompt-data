The variable `y2` is assigned the value of `b * cos(-t2)`. The previous values of the affected variables `b`, `t2`, and `y2` are not provided, but `y2` will now hold the result of the calculation based on the value of `b` and `t2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `y1` is `A * cos(-t1)`; `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`; `y2` is `b * cos(-t2)`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `y1` is `A * cos(-t1)`; `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`; `y2` is `b * cos(-t2)`**.
