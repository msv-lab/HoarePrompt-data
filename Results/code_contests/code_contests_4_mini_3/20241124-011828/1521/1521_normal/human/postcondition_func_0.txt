The function reads four integer inputs: `a` (1 to 1000), `b` (1 to 1000), `h` (0 to 11), and `m` (0 to 59). It calculates the distance between two points on a plane, where one point is determined by the input parameters `a`, `h`, and `m` (representing the position of the hour hand on a clock) and the other point is determined by `b` and `m` (representing the position of the minute hand). The calculated distance is printed, but there is no return value from the function.
