The variable `t1` is assigned the value `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`. The value of `h` is in the range from 0 to 11 and the value of `m` is in the range from 0 to 59. The expression calculates the angle in degrees for the hour hand based on the current hour and minute, converts it to radians, and assigns it to `t1`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59; `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned the integer values from the input; `t1` is the angle in radians calculated from `h` and `m`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59; `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned the integer values from the input; `t1` is the angle in radians calculated from `h` and `m`.**
