The variable `y2` is assigned the value of `b * cos(-t2)`. The values of `b` and `t2` are not specified in the initial state, but we know `b` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and `t2` is calculated in radians. Therefore, `y2` will be calculated based on the known range of `b` and the trigonometric cosine of `-t2`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `y2` is now calculated based on these variables, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59, `a` is an input integer, `t1` is calculated in radians, `x1` is calculated as -a * sin(-t1), `y1` is calculated as a * cos(-t1), `x2` is calculated as -b * sin(-t2), and `y2` is calculated as b * cos(-t2).**
