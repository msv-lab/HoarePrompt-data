The value of `t2` is assigned the value `radians(m % 60 * 6)`. The variable `m` is given as an integer between 0 and 59, so `m % 60` will result in the same value of `m`. Therefore, `t2` will be calculated as `radians(m * 6)`. The other variables (`A`, `B`, `H`, `a`, `b`, `h`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59; `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned the integer values from the input; `t1` is the angle in radians calculated from `h` and `m`; `t2` is calculated as radians(m * 6)**
