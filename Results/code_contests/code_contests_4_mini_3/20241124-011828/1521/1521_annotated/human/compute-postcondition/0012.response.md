To evaluate the output state, let's first summarize the provided variables and their calculations:

Initial State:
- `A` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `H` is an integer between 0 and 11.
- `M` is an integer between 0 and 59.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `t1` is calculated in radians.
- `x1` is calculated as `-a * sin(-t1)`.
- `y1` is calculated as `a * cos(-t1)`.
- `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`.
- `y2` is calculated as `b * cos(-t2)`.

The code snippet provided:
```
print(((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5)
```

This code calculates the distance between the two points defined by `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using the Euclidean distance formula.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` are not specified, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables. The output will show the formula being executed but without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59, `a` is an input integer, `x1` is calculated as `-a * sin(-t1)`, `y1` is calculated as `a * cos(-t1)`, `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`, `y2` is calculated as `b * cos(-t2)`, and the output is the distance calculated as `((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5`.**
