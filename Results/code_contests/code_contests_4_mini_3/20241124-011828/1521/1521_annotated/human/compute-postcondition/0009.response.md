The variable `y1` is assigned the value of `a * cos(-t1)`. The value of `a` is an input integer, and `t1` is calculated in radians. The other variables (`A`, `B`, `H`, `M`, `x1`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation involving `a` and `t1`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `B` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, `M` is an integer between 0 and 59; `a` is an input integer; `t1` is calculated in radians; `x1` is calculated as -a * sin(-t1); `y1` is calculated as a * cos(-t1).**
