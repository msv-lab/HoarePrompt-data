The function `func` accepts the parameters `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M`. `A` and `B` are integers between 1 and 1000, `H` is an integer between 0 and 11, and `M` is an integer between 0 and 59. However, the output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the return value based on the given constraints and relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters A and B as integers between 1 and 1000, H as an integer between 0 and 11, and M as an integer between 0 and 59; the return value is unspecified.**
