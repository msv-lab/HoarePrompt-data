Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer inputs: `a` and `b` (both between 1 and 1000), `h` (between 0 and 11), and `m` (between 0 and 59). It calculates the positions of the hour and minute hands of a clock based on these inputs and returns the Euclidean distance between the two hands as a float. The return value is printed directly to the output. However, there is no formal return statement in the function, which means it implicitly returns None. **
