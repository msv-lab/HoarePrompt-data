Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippet is incomplete and does not follow the problem description. The function `func_1()` only reads a line from standard input and returns it, which does not implement the logic described in the pseudocode for processing the string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.

Specifically, there is no logic that iterates through the characters of the string, updates the `cur` variable based on the characters, or counts the number of iterations (i.e., the `res` variable). 

For example, for the input string `s = "---"`, the expected output should be `9` according to the problem description, but the provided code does not compute this and simply returns an input string instead. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for any input, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
