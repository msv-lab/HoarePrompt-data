Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. 

### Explanation of the flaw:

The pseudocode describes a process where we iterate over all possible initial values (`init`) starting from `0` to infinity. The goal is to find the first `init` such that the process does not result in a negative `cur` throughout the entire string `s`. The variable `res` counts how many iterations (including the ones that result in `cur` going negative) are performed before we find a suitable `init`.

However, the provided program does not actually implement this logic correctly. 

1. The program calculates a prefix sum but does not account for all initial values of `init` as per the pseudocode. It only checks for negative prefix sums in the string and accumulates a count based on those negative values, which does not align with the logic of trying all possible `init` values.
  
2. The approach taken does not properly simulate the `for init = 0 to inf` loop. It only handles cases based on the prefix sums, which might lead to incorrect results, especially for longer strings with varying distributions of `+` and `-`.

### Test Case Example:

For the input string `--++`, the expected result should be calculated by considering initial values of `init` from `0` upwards. It would take several iterations to find a valid `init` that keeps `cur` non-negative throughout the entire string. However, the provided implementation would not correctly calculate the number of iterations or the necessary adjustments to `init`. 

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem statement in all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
