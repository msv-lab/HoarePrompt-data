Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is an integer less than the new value from `int(le.pop())`; `l` is updated based on the filtering condition. If `l` is non-empty, `af` is updated to include the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and its median value. If `l` is empty, `af` is updated to include an additional 0.***
