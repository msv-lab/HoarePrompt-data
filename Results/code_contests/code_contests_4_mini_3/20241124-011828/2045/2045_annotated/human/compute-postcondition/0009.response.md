The code `af.append(sum(abs(k - med) for k in l))` calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`. This value is then appended to the list `af`. 

- The variable `af` is affected as it will have a new value added to it.
- The previous values of `l` and `med` are used to perform the calculations, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.
- Therefore, the output state reflects that `af` is modified, but we can't determine the exact sum without specific values for `l` and `med`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer converted from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is the integer obtained from the previous `le.pop()`; `l` is a non-empty list of differences based on indices from the original list; `med` is the middle element of `l`; a new value is appended to `af` based on the sum of absolute differences**.
