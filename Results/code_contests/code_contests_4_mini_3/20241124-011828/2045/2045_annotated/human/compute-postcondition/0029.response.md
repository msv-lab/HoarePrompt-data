The line of code `af.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list `af`. The previous state of `af` is unchanged except for the addition of the new element. The other variables `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `l` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is an integer such that it should be less than the new value from `int(le.pop())`; `l` is updated based on the filtering condition; `af` is updated to include an additional 0.
