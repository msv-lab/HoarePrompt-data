Functionality: ** The function accepts input from the standard input, which consists of multiple test cases defined by an integer `t`. Each test case contains a string of `n` characters consisting of '.' and '*'. For each test case, the function calculates the sum of the absolute differences from the median of the indices where the character is '*' and stores the results. If no '*' is present in a test case, it appends 0 to the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. The function does not handle cases where there are fewer than two lines in the input, potentially leading to undefined behavior. **
