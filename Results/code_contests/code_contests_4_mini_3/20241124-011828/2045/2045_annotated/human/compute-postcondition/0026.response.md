The code snippet updates `l` by creating a new list where each element is the difference between the index and the value at that index in the original list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `af` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is an integer such that it should be less than the new value from `int(le.pop())`; `l` is updated based on the filtering condition; `af` remains unchanged.**
