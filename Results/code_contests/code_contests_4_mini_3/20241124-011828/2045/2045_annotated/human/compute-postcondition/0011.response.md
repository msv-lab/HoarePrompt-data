The code appends `0` to the list `af`. The initial state does not indicate the previous values of `af`, but since `l` is an empty list and there is no mention of `af` in the initial state, we can assume `af` is also initially an empty list. Therefore, after appending `0`, `af` will contain one element, which is `0`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer converted from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is an integer obtained from the previous `le.pop()`; `l` is an empty list; `af` is [0]**
