Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is the integer obtained from the previous `le.pop() + 1`; `l` is a list containing the differences between the indices of the original values. If `l` is non-empty, `med` is the median value of the list `l`, and `af` has a new element which is the sum of absolute differences from `med`. If `l` is empty, `af` has a new element 0 appended to it.***
