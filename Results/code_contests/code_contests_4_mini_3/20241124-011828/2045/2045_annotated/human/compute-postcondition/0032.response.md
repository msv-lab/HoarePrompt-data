Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is an integer obtained from the second last string in `le`; `af` is a list that stores the sum of absolute differences from the median of the list of indices where `l` equals '*'. If `l` is empty for any iteration, 0 is appended to `af`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `le` has less than 2 elements), `af` remains an empty list, and `n` and `zorg` are undefined.**
