The variable `l` is assigned the value of the last element removed from the list `le` using the `pop()` method. This operation decreases the length of `le` by one. The variables `t`, `n`, and `zorg` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is the integer obtained from the previous `le.pop() + 1`; `l` is now the last element of the original `le`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is the integer obtained from the previous `le.pop() + 1`; `l` is now the last element of the original `le`.**
