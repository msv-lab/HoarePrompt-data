The code appends to the list `af` the result of the expression `sum(abs(k - med) for k in l)`. Here, `med` is the middle element of the updated list `l`, which is not changed by this operation. The values of `t`, `n`, and `zorg` are not directly affected by this operation. The state of `af` will change as it gets a new value appended to it, calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`.

Since `l` is updated and `med` is defined based on this updated list, we can conclude that the output will depend on the specific elements of `l` and `med`. However, without specific values for `l` and `med`, we can state the impact on `af`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is an integer less than the new value from `int(le.pop())`; `l` is updated based on the filtering condition; `af` is updated to include the sum of absolute differences; `med` is the middle element of the updated list `l**.
