The code initializes an empty list `af`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged since the list is being created anew. The state of `t`, `n`, and `le` is unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `le` is a list of strings obtained from the reversed input lines, and `af` is an empty list**.
