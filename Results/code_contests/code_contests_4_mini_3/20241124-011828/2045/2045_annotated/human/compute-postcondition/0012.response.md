Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer converted from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is the integer obtained from the previous `le.pop()`. If `l` is a non-empty list of differences, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and a new value is appended to `af` based on the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`. If `l` is empty, the value 0 is appended to `af`.***
