The variable `n` is assigned the value from `int(le.pop())`, which removes and returns the last element of the list `le`, converting it to an integer. The other variables, including `t`, `zorg`, `l`, `med`, and `af`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is an integer such that it should be less than the new value from `int(le.pop())`; `l` is a list containing the differences between the indices of the original values; if `l` is non-empty, `med` is the median value of the list `l`, and `af` has a new element which is the sum of absolute differences from `med`; if `l` is empty, `af` has a new element 0 appended to it; `le` has at least one more element.**
