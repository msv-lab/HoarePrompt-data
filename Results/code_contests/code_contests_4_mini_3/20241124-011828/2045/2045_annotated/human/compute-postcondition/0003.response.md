The code `n = int(le.pop())` assigns the value of `n` to be the integer converted from the last string in the list `le`, which is removed from `le` by the `pop` method. The variable `zorg` was already assigned the value from `le.pop()` before this line was executed. Therefore, `le` will now have one less string, and the value of `n` will be the integer representation of the string that was last in the list.

Since the exact values of `le` and the string being popped are not provided, I can only describe the change in state generically. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer converted from the last string in `le`; `le` is the updated list of strings after one string has been removed; `zorg` is the integer obtained from the previous `le.pop()`**
