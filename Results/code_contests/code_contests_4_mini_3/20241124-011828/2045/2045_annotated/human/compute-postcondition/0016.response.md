The code snippet creates a list comprehension that assigns to `l` a new list containing the indices `k` for which the condition `l[k] == '*'` holds true, iterating over the range of `n`. The original variable `l` is overwritten by this new list, which only includes indices from the original list where the value was equal to `'*'`. 

As a result, the output state reflects the change in `l` based on the condition applied to its original state. The values of `t`, `n`, and `zorg` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is the integer obtained from the previous `le.pop() + 1`; `l` now contains indices where original values were '*'**.
