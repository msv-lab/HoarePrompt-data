Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the last string in `le`; `zorg` is an integer such that it should be less than the new value from `int(le.pop())`; `l` is the last element popped from `le` and its state has changed accordingly; `af` is updated to have a new element which is the sum of absolute differences from `med` if `l` was non-empty, or 0 appended to it if `l` was empty.**
