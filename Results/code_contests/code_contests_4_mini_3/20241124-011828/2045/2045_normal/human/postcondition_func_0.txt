The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a string of characters consisting of '.' and '*' symbols. For each test case, it calculates the absolute differences between the indices of the '*' characters in the string and appends the sum of these differences to a list. If there are no '*' characters in a test case, it appends 0 to the list. Finally, it prints the accumulated results for each test case. The function does not take any parameters directly but reads input from the standard input.
