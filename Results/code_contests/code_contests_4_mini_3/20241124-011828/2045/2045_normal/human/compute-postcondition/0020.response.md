The code `af.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `af`. The previous state of `af` is not provided, but we know it will now include the value `0` at the end. The values of `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `l` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping, incremented by 1; `l` is a list of indices k where `l[k]` is '*'; `l` is now a list of integers representing the differences between the indices of '*' characters in the original list; `af` has a new value `0` appended to it.**
