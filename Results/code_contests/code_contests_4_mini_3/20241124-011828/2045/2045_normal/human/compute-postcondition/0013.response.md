According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `zorg` and the integer value obtained from popping `le`. The loop is set to iterate `zorg` times, which is determined by the current value of `le.pop()`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping. Since the loop executes for `zorg` times, for it to execute one more time, `zorg` must be adjusted to represent the next value in the range. 

The value of `le` must contain at least one more element to allow for the next iteration. Since we are popping the last element of `le`, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, `le` should have at least one more element left after the current pop operation.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` should be set to the new last element of `le` after the next pop operation.
- `zorg` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration.

Since `l` is not directly relevant for the loop's execution condition, its state does not need to be adjusted unless specified otherwise in the loop body.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the new last element of `le` after popping, `le` has at least one more element, `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping, incremented by 1.**
