The variable `med` is assigned the value of `l[len(l) // 2]`. The length of the list `l` is used to find the middle index (integer division by 2). Since `l` is a non-empty list, the calculation will yield a valid middle index, and `med` will take on the value from that index in `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `le`, `af`, and `zorg` remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping; `le` has one less element; `af` is an empty list; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping; `l` is a non-empty list of differences calculated from the original indices; `med` is the middle element of `l`.**
