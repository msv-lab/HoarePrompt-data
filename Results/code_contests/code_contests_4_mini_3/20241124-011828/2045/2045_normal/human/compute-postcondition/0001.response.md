The code initializes an empty list `af`. The previous values of the affected variables (`t`, `n`, and `le`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 for each test case, `le` is a list of strings obtained from the input, reversed, and `af` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 for each test case, `le` is a list of strings obtained from the input, reversed, and `af` is an empty list**.
