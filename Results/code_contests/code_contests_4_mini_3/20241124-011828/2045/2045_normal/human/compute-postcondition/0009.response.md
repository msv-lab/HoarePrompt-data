The code appends the sum of absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med` to the list `af`. The values of `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `l` do not change, and the only affected variable is `af`, which will now contain the computed sum.

The sum is calculated as follows:
1. For each element `k` in `l`, compute `abs(k - med)`.
2. Sum all the computed absolute values.
3. Append this sum to the list `af`.

Given that `med` is the middle element of `l`, the output state will reflect the updated contents of `af`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping; `le` has one less element; `af` now contains the previous values plus the sum of absolute differences, `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping; `l` is a non-empty list of differences calculated from the original indices; `med` is the middle element of `l`.**
