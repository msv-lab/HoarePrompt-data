Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping, and `le` now has one less element; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping. If `l` is a non-empty list of differences calculated from the original indices, then `af` contains the previous values plus the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the middle element `med` of `l`, which is the middle element at index `len(l) // 2`. If `l` is empty, `af` contains only the value 0.***
