Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping, incremented by 1; and `l` is a list of integers representing the differences between the indices of '*' characters in the original list. If `l` is not empty, `med`, the middle element of `l`, is used to compute `af`, which now includes the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med`. If `l` is empty, `af` has a new value of `0` appended to it. This ensures that `af` reflects the computed values based on the contents of `l` or defaults to `0` if `l` is empty.***
