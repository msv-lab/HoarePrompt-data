The variable `l` is assigned the value obtained from popping the last element of the list `le`. This means the last element of `le` is removed from the list, and `l` holds that value. The variables `t`, `n`, `af`, and `zorg` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping, `le` now has one less element, `af` is an empty list, and `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping, `le` now has one less element, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping, and `l` is the value popped from `le`.**
