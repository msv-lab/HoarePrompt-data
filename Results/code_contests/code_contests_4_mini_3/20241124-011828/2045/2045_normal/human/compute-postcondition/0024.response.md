The variable `l` is assigned the value obtained from popping the last element of the list `le`. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation, as it retains the integer value from the last element of `le` before popping. The variable `zorg` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `l` and confirms the values of `n` and `zorg`.

Output State: **`l` is the last element of `le`, `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping, `zorg` is 0**
