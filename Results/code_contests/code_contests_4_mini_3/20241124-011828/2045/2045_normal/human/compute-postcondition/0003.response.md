After executing the code, `n` is assigned the value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping it. The list `le` will have one less string as its last element has been removed. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping, `le` is a list with one less string, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping.**
