The instruction appends the value `0` to the list `af`, which is currently empty. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `le`, `zorg`, and `l`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `af`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping; `le` has one less element; `af` is a list containing 0; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping; `l` is an empty list.**
