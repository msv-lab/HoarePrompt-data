The value of `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from popping the last element of the list `le`. The variable `le` will have one less element after the operation, while `t` remains a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, `zorg` remains 0, and `l` remains unchanged. The exact value of `n` will depend on the last element of `le` before the pop operation. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping; `zorg` is 0; `l` remains unchanged.**
