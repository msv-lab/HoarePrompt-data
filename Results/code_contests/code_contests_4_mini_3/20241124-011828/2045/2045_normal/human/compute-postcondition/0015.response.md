The variable `l` is assigned the value obtained by popping the last element from the list `le`. This means that `le` loses its last element, which was previously the value of `n`. Therefore, after this operation, `n` will no longer be the last element of `le`, and `zorg` remains unchanged since it was defined as the value of the last element of `le` before popping, incremented by 1.

Thus, the output state reflects the changes in `le` and the assignment made to `l`. Since `le` had at least one more element before popping, the values of `n` and `zorg` remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping, incremented by 1; `l` is the integer value that was the last element of `le` before popping.**
