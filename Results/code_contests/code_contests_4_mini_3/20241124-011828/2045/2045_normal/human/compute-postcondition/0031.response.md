According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `zorg` and the result of `int(le.pop())`. The loop will execute `int(le.pop())` times, starting with `zorg` initialized to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `zorg` is 0, and `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping.

For the loop to execute one more time, `zorg` must be less than `n`. After one iteration, `zorg` will increase by 1. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Since `n` is currently the value obtained from the last element of `le`, and we need to ensure it is greater than the current `zorg`, which is 0, we need to adjust `n` to ensure it is at least 1.

State: **`l` is the updated list of differences, `n` is greater than 1, `zorg` is 0**
