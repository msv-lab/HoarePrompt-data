The expression `l = [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]` creates a new list `l` where each element is the difference between the index `a` and the value `b` at that index from the original list `l`. The `enumerate` function provides both the index and the value for each element in `l`.

Since `l` originally contained a list of indices where the original `l` had a '*', we will need to calculate the differences based on the current values of `l`.

Let's analyze the state:

- `l` is a list of indices.
- After applying the list comprehension, `l` will be transformed into a list of differences.

Since the values of `a` (the index) and `b` (the value at that index) are dependent on the current state of `l`, the new list will contain the differences for each corresponding index in the list.

The output state reflects the transformation of `l` based on the differences calculated.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping; `le` now has one less element; `af` is an empty list; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping; `l` is now a list of differences calculated from the original indices.**
