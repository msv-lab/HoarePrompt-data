Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping, representing the number of iterations executed; `l` is a list of integers representing the differences between the indices of '*' characters in the original string; `af` contains the accumulated sums of absolute differences for each test case processed; and the output is the joined string representation of `af` values printed, which could be an empty output if `af` is empty or contain the computed values based on `l` for each iteration.**
