Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` after popping; `zorg` is the integer value obtained from the last element of `le` before popping, and it represents the number of iterations executed; `l` is a list of integers representing the differences between the indices of '*' characters in the original string; `af` contains the accumulated sums of absolute differences for each test case processed. If `le` is empty before the loop starts, the loop does not execute and `af` remains an empty list; if `l` is empty after processing, `af` will have 0 appended to it for that iteration. If `l` is non-empty, `af` will contain the computed values based on `l` for each iteration.**
