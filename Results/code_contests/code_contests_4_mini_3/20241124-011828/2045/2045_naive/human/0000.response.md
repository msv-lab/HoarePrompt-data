To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and the logic it implements.

### Problem Analysis
The goal of the problem is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to align all sheep ('*') in a string so that there are no empty spaces ('.') between them. The moves allowed are to shift sheep left or right into empty spaces.

### Program Analysis
1. The program reads the input using `sys.__stdin__.read()`, which is not a standard practice for competitive programming; normally, `input()` or `sys.stdin.read()` would be used.
2. It processes multiple test cases in a loop.
3. For each test case:
   - It identifies the positions of the sheep in the string.
   - It calculates the differences between the positions of the sheep and their median position.
   - It sums up the absolute differences to find the minimum number of moves required.

### Issues with the Code
1. **Median Calculation**: The code calculates the median position based on indices of sheep, which may not correspond correctly to the aligned positions.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Moves**: The logic for calculating the number of moves might not work correctly in scenarios where there are sheep spread out too far apart. The absolute distance from the median may not yield the correct number of moves required. For example, if the sheep are at positions 0, 5, and 10, aligning them at position 5 would require 10 moves, but the code may miscalculate this.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if all sheep are already aligned or if there are no sheep at all, it should handle those cases explicitly.

### Testing Potential Cases
1. For input `1` with string `*...*`, the expected output is `2` moves to align the sheep in the middle (positions 1 and 2), but the code would calculate based on the median and would not arrive at `2`.
2. For input `1` with string `.*.*`, the expected output is `2` moves to align the sheep, but the code might return incorrect results due to its logic.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not adhere strictly to the problem requirements as outlined, and there are cases where it can yield incorrect results, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
