The function accepts two parameters, `startIndex` and `branchLength`. It prints the value of `startIndex` and pairs of consecutive integers starting from `startIndex` up to `startIndex + branchLength - 2` if `branchLength` is at least 2. If `branchLength` is less than 2, no output is printed. The function returns the value of `startIndex + branchLength`. Note that if `branchLength` is 1, only `startIndex` is printed, and if `branchLength` is 0 or negative, no output occurs and the function still returns `startIndex + branchLength`.
