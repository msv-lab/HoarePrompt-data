To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to break down the logic of the code and verify it against the requirements specified.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k` which represent the number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes, respectively.
   
2. **Distance Calculation**: The calculation for `maxDistance` is performed using:
   ```python
   minLength = (n - 1) // k
   r = (n - 1) % k
   maxDistance = minLength * 2 + (2 if r >= 2 else r)
   ```
   Here, `minLength` determines how many nodes can be connected to each exit-node while `r` indicates any remaining nodes that cannot fit evenly amongst the exit-nodes. The calculation for `maxDistance` attempts to account for these factors.

3. **Output Construction**: The program then constructs the connections between nodes based on `minLength` and `r`:
   - It uses the `func_1` function to print connections starting from `startIndex`. 
   - The function prints pairs of consecutive integers starting from `startIndex` for `branchLength`, which determines how many nodes to connect.

### Potential Edge Cases

- **Minimum Values**: The smallest case with `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The output should be a straightforward connection between the nodes, which seems to be handled correctly.
  
- **Unequal Distribution**: For cases where `n` is much larger than `k`, ensuring that no exit-node ends up being disconnected or improperly connected could be a problem if `minLength` is not calculated correctly.

- **Printing Output**: The program must ensure that all `n-1` connections are printed and that all nodes are connected correctly according to the problem's requirements.

### Output Hints Check

The output hints describe the functionality of the `func_1` function:
- It mentions that `branchLength` must be at least 2 to print connections, which could lead to cases where nodes are not connected correctly if `branchLength` is 1 or less, as it does not print any connections in that case.

### Conclusion

The code does not explicitly handle edge cases where nodes are left disconnected if `branchLength` is calculated incorrectly or if it inadvertently results in a situation where an exit-node does not meet its requirement of being connected to exactly one other node. 

Moreover, the logic for calculating `maxDistance` seems to lack clarity on how it ensures that all exit-nodes are equidistantly connected, especially in cases where `k` is large compared to `n`.

Since there are potential scenarios where the program may not connect the nodes correctly or handle all cases based on the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not adequately ensure that all exit nodes are connected as required, particularly in edge cases where the distribution of nodes is uneven.
