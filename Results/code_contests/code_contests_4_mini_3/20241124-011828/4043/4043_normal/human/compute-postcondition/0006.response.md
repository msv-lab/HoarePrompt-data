The code snippet prints the values of `i` and `i + 1`. The value of `i` is given as `startIndex + 2`, which is known, but the specific value of `startIndex` is not provided. Therefore, the output will reflect the calculation of `i` and `i + 1` based on the expression used.

Since `i` is `startIndex + 2`, we can represent `i + 1` as `startIndex + 3`. The values will be printed in the format specified in the print statement.

The Output State will thus include the representation of `i` and `i + 1`, but since we do not have a specific numeric value for `startIndex`, we can only express this in terms of `startIndex`.

Output State: **`i` is `startIndex + 2`, `i + 1` is `startIndex + 3`, and the output is '{0} {1}' formatted with these values.**
