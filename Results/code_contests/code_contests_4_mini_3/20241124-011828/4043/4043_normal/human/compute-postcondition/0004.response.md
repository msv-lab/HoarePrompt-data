The code prints the formatted string with `i` and `i + 1`. Since `i` is `startIndex + 1`, the output will reflect this value. The state of other variables is not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state will include the value of `i` and `i + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `startIndex + 1`, and the print output is '{0} {1}' where 0 is `i` and 1 is `i + 1`**
