The `print` statement formats and prints the values `1` and `startIndex`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `startIndex`, so we cannot determine its value. The variable `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the known values and the unknown value of `startIndex`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and the function prints '1' and the value of startIndex**.
