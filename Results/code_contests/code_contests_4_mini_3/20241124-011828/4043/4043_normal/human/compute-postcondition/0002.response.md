The `print` function outputs a formatted string where `{0}` is replaced by the current value of `i` and `{1}` is replaced by `i + 1`. The variable `i` is currently equal to `startIndex`, which is within the range defined (0 â‰¤ startIndex < n - 1). Therefore, the output will display the values of `i` and `i + 1` based on the value of `startIndex`. The values of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is `startIndex`, and `i + 1` is `startIndex + 1`, printed as 'startIndex startIndex + 1'**
