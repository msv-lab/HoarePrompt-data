Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `startIndex` is an integer, and `branchLength` is an integer such that `branchLength` is at least 2 (to ensure the loop runs at least once).

Code of the loop:
```
for i in xrange(startIndex, startIndex + branchLength - 1):
    print('{0} {1}'.format(i, i + 1))
```

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `startIndex`, and `i + 1` is `startIndex + 1`, printed as 'startIndex startIndex + 1'.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `startIndex + 1`, and `i + 1` is `startIndex + 2`, printed as 'startIndex + 1 startIndex + 2'.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `startIndex + 2`, and `i + 1` is `startIndex + 3`, printed as 'startIndex + 2 startIndex + 3'.

The loop will execute `branchLength - 1` times, starting from `startIndex` and ending at `startIndex + branchLength - 2`. If `branchLength` is less than 2, the loop will not execute at all, and there will be no printed output. Additionally, if `startIndex` is such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1` exceeds `n`, the loop will still execute, but the values printed will be constrained to the range of indices starting from `startIndex`.

Output State: **If branchLength is at least 2, the loop prints pairs of consecutive integers starting from `startIndex` up to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`. If branchLength is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and no output is printed. If startIndex is too high such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1` exceeds n, the loop may still execute but the printed values will be limited by the defined range.**
