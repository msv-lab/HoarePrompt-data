To determine how the state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided information.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in xrange(startIndex, startIndex + branchLength - 1)`. This means the loop will run while `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `startIndex + 1`. This implies that the current value of `i` is already one more than the `startIndex`.
3. The print output is '{0} {1}', where 0 is `i` and 1 is `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `startIndex + 1`, the output would be `'{0} {1}'` => `'{startIndex + 1} {startIndex + 2}'`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The current value of `i` needs to be less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`.
- Since `i` is currently `startIndex + 1`, for the loop to continue, it must be true that `startIndex + 1` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. This simplifies to `1 < branchLength - 1`, which further simplifies to `branchLength > 2`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need the following adjustments:
- `i` should be incremented to `startIndex + 2` (which would be the next value in the loop).
- We also need to ensure that the `branchLength` is greater than 2.

State: **`i` is `startIndex + 2`, branchLength is greater than 2**
