To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the given code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:** We receive two integers, `n` (total nodes) and `k` (number of exit-nodes).
2. **Output:** 
   - The minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes.
   - A list of connections (wires) between the nodes that meets the criteria:
     - `k` nodes should be exit-nodes (connected to exactly one other node).
     - All other nodes should be connected to at least two nodes.
  
### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is incomplete. It only includes a function `func_1` that seems to handle part of the logic related to connecting nodes, but it does not show how the entire network is constructed to meet the problem's requirements.

#### Issues:
1. **Incomplete Logic:** 
   - The function `func_1` is designed to connect nodes from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, but there is no overall logic that specifies how to determine the `branchLength` or how many branches to create based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - The function does not address the requirement to minimize the maximum distance between the exit-nodes.
  
2. **Missing Connections:** 
   - The code does not ensure that exactly `k` exit-nodes are connected to only one other node, nor does it verify that the remaining `n-k` nodes are connected to at least two nodes.

3. **Output Constraints:** 
   - The function only prints the pairs of connections but does not calculate or print the minimum distance between the exit-nodes.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 2`. The program must produce:
- Two exit nodes with each connected to one other node, and two additional nodes connected to at least two other nodes.
  
Possible valid output:
```
2
1 2
2 3
2 4
```
This satisfies the conditions as both `1` and `2` are exit nodes connected to just one other node, while `3` and `4` are connected to `2`.

However, the provided code does not guarantee such a structure and may fail to meet the requirements for various inputs due to its incomplete and incorrect implementation.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description and does not provide a complete solution or handle all potential cases correctly, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program lacks necessary logic to ensure that all constraints of the problem are met.
