You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arkady needs your help again! This time he decided to build his own high-speed Internet exchange point. It should consist of n nodes connected with minimum possible number of wires into one network (a wire directly connects two nodes). Exactly k of the nodes should be exit-nodes, that means that each of them should be connected to exactly one other node of the network, while all other nodes should be connected to at least two nodes in order to increase the system stability.

Arkady wants to make the system as fast as possible, so he wants to minimize the maximum distance between two exit-nodes. The distance between two nodes is the number of wires a package needs to go through between those two nodes.

Help Arkady to find such a way to build the network that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is as small as possible.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes.

Note that it is always possible to build at least one network with n nodes and k exit-nodes within the given constraints.

Output

In the first line print the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes. In each of the next n - 1 lines print two integers: the ids of the nodes connected by a wire. The description of each wire should be printed exactly once. You can print wires and wires' ends in arbitrary order. The nodes should be numbered from 1 to n. Exit-nodes can have any ids.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 2


Output

2
1 2
2 3


Input

5 3


Output

3
1 2
2 3
3 4
3 5

Note

In the first example the only network is shown on the left picture.

In the second example one of optimal networks is shown on the right picture.

Exit-nodes are highlighted.

Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(startIndex, branchLength):
    print('{0} {1}'.format(1, startIndex))
    for i in xrange(startIndex, startIndex + branchLength - 1):
        print('{0} {1}'.format(i, i + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `if startIndex + branchLength - 1 > startIndex then the loop executes at least once with i starting from startIndex and ending at startIndex + branchLength - 2, printing pairs of integers; if branchLength < 2 the loop does not execute, and the values of n, k, and startIndex remain unchanged.`
    return startIndex + branchLength
    #The program returns the sum of startIndex and branchLength

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
