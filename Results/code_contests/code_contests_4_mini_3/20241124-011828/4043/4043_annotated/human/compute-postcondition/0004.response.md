The code prints the formatted string with the values of `i` and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `startIndex + 1`, and `startIndex` is within the range of `0` to `n - 1`. Therefore, the value of `i` will range from `1` to `n`. The output will depend on the specific value of `startIndex`.

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `startIndex` is an integer such that 0 ≤ startIndex < n; `i` is `startIndex + 1`, and the function prints the values of `i` and `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `startIndex` is an integer such that 0 ≤ startIndex < n; `i` is `startIndex + 1`, and the function prints the values of `i` and `i + 1`.**
