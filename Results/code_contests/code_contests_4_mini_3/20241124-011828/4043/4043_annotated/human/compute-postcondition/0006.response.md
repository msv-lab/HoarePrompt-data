The `print` statement outputs a formatted string using the values of `i` and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is initialized as `startIndex + 2`. The values of `i` and `i + 1` depend on the `startIndex`, which is constrained by the condition `0 ≤ startIndex < n`. 

Since `startIndex` can vary but is at least 0, the minimum value of `i` would be `0 + 2 = 2` and the maximum value would be `n - 1 + 2 = n + 1`. Therefore, `i` can take on values from 2 to `n + 1`. Consequently, `i + 1` can take values from 3 to `n + 2`.

The output state will reflect the possible values for `i` and `i + 1`. Since `startIndex` is variable, we summarize its impact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`; `startIndex` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `startIndex` < `n`; `i` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `i` ≤ `n + 1`; and the printed values are formatted as '{0} {1}' where {0} is `i` and {1} is `i + 1`.**
