The code uses the `print` function to output a formatted string. Here, the value `1` is printed as the first element, and `startIndex` is used as the second element but its value is not defined in the initial state. The other variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the known value and the undefined variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; the function prints '1' and 'startIndex'**
