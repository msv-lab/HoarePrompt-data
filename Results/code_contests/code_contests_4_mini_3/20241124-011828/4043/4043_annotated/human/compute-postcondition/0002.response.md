The code prints the values of `i` and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is initialized to the value of `startIndex`, which lies within the range specified (0 ≤ startIndex < n). Therefore, the values printed will be `startIndex` and `startIndex + 1`. 

Since the exact value of `startIndex` is not provided, we can only denote it as a variable in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `startIndex` is an integer such that 0 ≤ startIndex < n; `i` is `startIndex`, and the output of the print statement is '{0} {1}' where {0} is `startIndex` and {1} is `startIndex + 1`.**
