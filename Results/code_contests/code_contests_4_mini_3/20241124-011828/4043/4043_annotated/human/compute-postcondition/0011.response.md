Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `startIndex` and `branchLength`. It prints a series of integer pairs starting from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`. If `branchLength` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and no pairs are printed. Finally, it returns the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`.**
