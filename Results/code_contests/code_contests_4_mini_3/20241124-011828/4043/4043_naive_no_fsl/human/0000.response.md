To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the code and see if it meets all the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Parameters**: The program takes two integers, `n` (total nodes) and `k` (exit-nodes).
2. **Output Requirements**: 
   - The minimum distance between the two most distant exit-nodes.
   - A description of the connections (wires) between the nodes.

### Code Logic Analysis
- The code calculates the minimum length of branches each exit-node can have and how many additional nodes can be added based on the remainder of nodes after distributing them among exit-nodes.
- The distance is calculated based on the formula: `maxDistance = minLength * 2 + (2 if r >= 2 else r)`.
- The function `func_1` is responsible for printing the connections.

### Potential Issues
1. **Branching Logic**: The code assumes it can always branch out `minLength` wires directly. In cases where `n` is not perfectly divisible by `k`, if `k` is close to `n`, there might be a configuration where the exit-nodes are not optimally connected.
2. **Output Format**: The nodes are numbered from 1 to `n`, but the program does not ensure that the connection between nodes adheres to the rules specified in the problem description for all cases, particularly when `k` is close to `n`.

### Example to Test
Consider the input case:
```
n = 4
k = 3
```
This means we have 4 nodes and need 3 exit-nodes. The expected behavior is:
- The exit-nodes should be connected such that we minimize the distance. 

However, the program may not handle this case correctly:
- If we try to construct a network, we could end up with something like:
```
1 -- 2
1 -- 3
1 -- 4
```
Here, the exit nodes would be 2, 3, and 4, and the distance between exit nodes 2 and 4 is 2, which is not minimal.

### Conclusion
The program does not account for the edge case where `k` is very close to `n`, leading to a situation where the connections between exit-nodes can be more than necessary, thus failing to minimize the distance properly.

Correctness: **False**
