The function accepts an integer `N` (3 ≤ N ≤ 10) and a list `listL` of `N` integers (1 ≤ L_i ≤ 100). It calculates the sum of the integers in `listL`, excluding the maximum integer from that sum. It then checks if the maximum integer is less than the remaining sum; if it is, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not handle invalid input cases such as `N` being outside the specified range or non-integer inputs.
