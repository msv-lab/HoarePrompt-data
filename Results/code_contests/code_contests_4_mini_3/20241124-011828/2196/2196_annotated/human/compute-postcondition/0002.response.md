The value of `maxL` is assigned the maximum value from the list `listL`. As `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `listL` contains `N` integers provided by user input. The value of `maxL` will be the highest integer present in that list. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10; `listL` is a list of `N` integers from user input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10; `listL` is a list of `N` integers from user input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`**.
