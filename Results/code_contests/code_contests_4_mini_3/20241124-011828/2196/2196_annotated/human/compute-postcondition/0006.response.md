According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `N`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. The value of `N` remains unchanged, as it is still within the required range, and the value of `maxL` is not affected directly by the loop iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `listL` is a list of `N` integers, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `i` is 1, and `sum` is updated by adding `listL[1]` to its previous value.**
