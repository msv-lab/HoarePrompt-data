The `print('No')` statement outputs the string 'No' to the console. It does not alter the values of any variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, and the output is 'No'.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, and the output is 'No'**
