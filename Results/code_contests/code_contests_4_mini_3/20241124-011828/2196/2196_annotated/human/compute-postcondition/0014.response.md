The code executes a print statement which outputs the string 'Yes' to the console. The values of `sum`, `N`, and `maxL` are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains the information about the initial values of these variables while also indicating the action taken by the print statement.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `maxL` is less than `sum`, and 'Yes' is printed to the console.**
