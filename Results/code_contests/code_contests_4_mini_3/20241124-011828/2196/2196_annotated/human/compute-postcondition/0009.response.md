The value of `sum` is updated by adding `listL[i]` to its previous value. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `listL[i]` corresponds to `listL[2]`. Since `N` is within the range of 3 to 10, `listL` contains at least 3 integers, and `listL[i]` is valid. The previous value of `sum` has been updated by adding the value of `listL[2]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `listL` is a list of `N` integers, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `i` is 2, and `sum` is updated by adding `listL[2]` to its previous value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `listL` is a list of `N` integers, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `i` is 2, and `sum` is updated by adding `listL[2] to its previous value.**
