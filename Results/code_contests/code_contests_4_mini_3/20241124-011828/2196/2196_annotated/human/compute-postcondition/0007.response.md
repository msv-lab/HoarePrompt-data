The code updates the value of `sum` by adding the value of `listL[i]` to its previous value. The value of `i` is 1, so `listL[i]` refers to the second element in the list `listL`. The previous value of `sum` is updated by this addition. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `listL` is a list of `N` integers, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `i` is 1, and `sum` is updated by adding `listL[1]` to its previous value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `listL` is a list of `N` integers, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `i` is 1, and `sum` is updated by adding `listL[1] to its previous value.**
