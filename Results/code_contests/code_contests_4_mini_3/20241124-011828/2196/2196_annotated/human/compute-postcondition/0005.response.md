The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value at index `i` of `listL` to it. Since `i` is 0, it accesses the first element of `listL`. The previous values of the affected variables are `N` (an integer between 3 and 10), `listL` (a list of `N` integers), `maxL` (the maximum value from `listL`), and `i` (which is 0). The output state will reflect the updated value of `sum`, but since we don't have the initial value of `sum` or the first element of `listL`, we can only express the outcome in a general way.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `listL` is a list of `N` integers, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `i` is 0, and `sum` is updated by adding `listL[0]` to its previous value.**
