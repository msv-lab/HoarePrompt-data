The variable `sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The initial values of `N`, `listL`, and `maxL` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the unaffected variables as well as the new value of `sum`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10; `listL` is a list of `N` integers from user input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`; `sum` is 0**
