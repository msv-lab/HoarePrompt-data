The function `func` accepts a parameter `N`, which is an integer satisfying the constraint 3 <= N <= 10. It also accepts a parameter `listL`, which is a list of integers of length N, where each integer L_i satisfies the constraint 1 <= L_i <= 100. After executing the function body, it processes the list based on these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (3 <= N <= 10) and a list listL of N integers (1 <= L_i <= 100), and processes these inputs accordingly.**
