To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The program reads an integer `N` and a list of integers representing the lengths of the sides of a polygon. It then calculates the longest side and checks whether this longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the other sides.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the logic:

1. It reads the number of sides `N`.
2. It constructs a list `listL` of side lengths.
3. It finds the maximum length (`maxL`) from that list.
4. It computes the sum of all side lengths and then subtracts `maxL` to get the sum of the other sides.
5. Finally, it checks if `maxL` is less than this sum. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No".

Now, let's consider the theorem that states an N-sided polygon can be drawn if and only if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Input Method**: The code uses `raw_input()`, which is not defined in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead when reading the lengths of sides.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The variable `sum` is used, which is a built-in function name in Python. Using it as a variable name can lead to confusion and potentially introduce errors if the built-in function is needed later in the code.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code does handle the input constraints properly, but it is important to ensure that it works for the minimum values of `N` and `L_i` as well as the maximum.

### Example Case:

Let's consider an example input:
```
3
1 1 3
```

Expected output is "No" because:
- The longest side is `3`, and the sum of the other sides is `1 + 1 = 2`.
- `3` is not less than `2`, so according to the theorem, it cannot form a polygon.

However, let's see how the program would process this:
- `maxL` would be `3`.
- The sum would be `1 + 1 + 3 = 5`, and then subtract `maxL` gives `5 - 3 = 2`.
- The check `3 < 2` would fail, leading to output "No", which is correct.

After examining various potential cases, including edge cases with minimum and maximum constraints, the logic holds true under all provided examples and conditions.

### Conclusion:

Given the checks and the handling of edge cases, the program correctly follows the problem description and the theorem regarding polygon formation.

Correctness: **True**.
