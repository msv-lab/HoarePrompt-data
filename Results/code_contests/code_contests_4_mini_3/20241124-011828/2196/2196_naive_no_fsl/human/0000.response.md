Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input for polygons with the specified conditions. Specifically, the problem lies in the way it reads input using `raw_input()` instead of `input()`, which would cause an error in Python 3. Additionally, the program does not account for the condition where the number of sides (N) is less than 3, which should not be allowed according to the constraints.

Moreover, the program uses a variable name `sum`, which is a built-in function name in Python. Using built-in function names for variables can lead to confusion and unintended behavior.

Here's a specific case where the program would fail:

Input:
```
3
1 1 3
```

Expected output:
```
No
```

Program output:
```
Yes
```

In this case, the longest side (3) is not strictly shorter than the sum of the other two sides (1 + 1 = 2), and therefore the output should be "No." However, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" due to the logic that mistakenly calculates the condition.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
