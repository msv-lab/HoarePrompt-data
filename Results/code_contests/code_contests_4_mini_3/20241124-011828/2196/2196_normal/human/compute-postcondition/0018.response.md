The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on the constraints provided. It expects `N`, an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, with the condition that \(3 \leq N \leq 10\). Additionally, it requires \(L_i\), a list of integers where each \(L_i\) (representing the length of each side of the polygon) must satisfy \(1 \leq L_i \leq 100\) for each of the \(N\) sides.

The function evaluates the properties of the polygon based on the values of \(N\) and \(L_i\). The output is not specified in the prompt, but it can be inferred that the function would likely determine and return some characteristic of the polygon based on the input lengths and the number of sides.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N representing the number of sides of a polygon (where 3 <= N <= 10) and a list of integers L_i representing the lengths of the sides (where 1 <= L_i <= 100 for each side). It evaluates the properties of the polygon based on these inputs.**
