The value of `sum` is updated by adding `listL[i]` to it. The initial value of `sum` is `listL[0]`, and since `i` is 1, `listL[i]` refers to the second element in the `listL`. The output state reflects the updated value of `sum` after the addition. The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list of integers from input, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `sum` is updated to `sum + listL[1]`, `i` is 1**
