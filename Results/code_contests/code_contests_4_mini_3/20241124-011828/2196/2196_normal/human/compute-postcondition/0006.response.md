According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` is between 3 and 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1 and it needs to be ensured that `i` is still less than `N`. 

Since `N` is at least 3, and `i` will become 1, the loop can execute again. The other states (`listL`, `maxL`, and `sum`) do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list of integers from input, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `sum` is equal to `listL[0]`, `i` is 1**
