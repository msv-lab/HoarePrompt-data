The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `N` (an integer between 3 and 10), `listL` (a list of integers from input), and `maxL` (the maximum value from `listL`). The initialization of `sum` does not affect other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers from input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`; `sum` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers from input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`; `sum` is 0**
