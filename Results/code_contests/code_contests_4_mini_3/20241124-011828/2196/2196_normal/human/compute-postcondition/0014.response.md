The code snippet prints 'Yes'. The values of `sum` and `maxL` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current condition where `sum` has been decreased by the value of `maxL`, and `maxL` is less than `sum`.

Output State: **`sum` has been decreased by the value of `maxL`, and `maxL` is less than `sum`; 'Yes' is printed**.
