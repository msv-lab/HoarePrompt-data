The code prints 'No', which does not change the values of `sum` or `maxL`. The previous state indicates that `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`. Therefore, the output state is: `sum` is decreased by the value of `maxL`, `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, and the output is 'No'.

Output State: **`sum` is decreased by the value of `maxL`, `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, and the output is 'No'**
