The variable `N` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new value of `N`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10**
