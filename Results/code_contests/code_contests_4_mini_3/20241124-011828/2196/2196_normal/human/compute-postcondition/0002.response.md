The value of `maxL` is assigned the maximum value from `listL`. Since `listL` is provided as input containing integers, the specific maximum value will depend on the contents of `listL`. The value of `N` does not affect the calculation of `maxL`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current known values of `N` and `listL`, as well as the newly calculated `maxL`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers from input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`.**
