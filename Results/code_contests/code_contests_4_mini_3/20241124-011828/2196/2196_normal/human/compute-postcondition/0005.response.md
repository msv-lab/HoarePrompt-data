The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]` to it. The initial value of `sum` is 0, and since `i` is 0, the code adds the first element of `listL` to `sum`. The value of `listL` is not specified, but since it is a list of integers, `listL[0]` will be some integer value. Therefore, after execution, `sum` will be equal to `listL[0]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list of integers from input, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `sum` is equal to `listL[0]`, `i` is 0**
