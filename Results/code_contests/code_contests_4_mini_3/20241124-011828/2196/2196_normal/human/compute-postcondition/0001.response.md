The variable `listL` is assigned a list comprehension that takes input from `raw_input()`, splits it into substrings, converts each substring into an integer, and collects them into a list. The value of `N` does not change, but it indicates the number of integers that should be inputted. The output state will reflect that `listL` now holds a list of integers based on the input provided. Therefore, we cannot specify the exact values in `listL` without knowing the input, but we note that it will contain integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers from input.**
