The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]` to it. The previous value of `i` is 2, so `listL[i]` refers to `listL[2]`. Since `listL` is a list of integers from input, its exact values are not specified, but `listL[2]` will be an integer from that list. The current value of `sum` will be increased by the value of `listL[2]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `sum` and the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list of integers from input, `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`, `sum` is updated to `sum + listL[2]`, `i` is 2**
