The function accepts an integer N that represents the number of sides of a polygon and a list of integers representing the lengths of those sides. It calculates the sum of the provided lengths, excluding the maximum length, and checks if the maximum length is less than the sum of the other lengths. If the maximum length is less than the sum, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. However, the function does not handle cases where the number of lengths provided is less than N, which could lead to an error when trying to calculate the maximum length or the sum. Additionally, there is no validation for the input values to ensure they meet the specified constraints (3 ≤ N ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ L_i ≤ 100).
