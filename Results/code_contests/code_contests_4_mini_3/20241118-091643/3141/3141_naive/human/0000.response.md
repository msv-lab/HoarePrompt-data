To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are 999 towers with varying heights.
- For two adjacent towers, we are given the heights of the visible parts (`a` for the west tower and `b` for the east tower).
- We need to determine the height of the snow cover (`x`), ensuring that the depth of the snow cover is at least 1 meter.

### Given Program:
```python
(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from input, which represent the visible heights of the two adjacent towers.
2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - It calculates `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`.
   - The term `(b - a)` represents the difference in height between the two towers.
   - The multiplication by `(b - a - 1) / 2` is intended to derive the snow cover based on the difference and the number of segments between the two heights. 
   - Finally, it subtracts `a` from this result.

### Identifying Potential Issues:
- The formula used in the program does not directly relate to the height of the snow cover. The expected relationship based on the problem description suggests that:
   - The snow cover `x` can be computed as `x = height of the higher tower - visible height of the higher tower`.
   - Given the heights of the towers, the depth of snow can be derived from the height of the towers calculated as `height of the east tower = b + x` and `height of the west tower = a + x`.
   - Thus, we can set up the equation: `b + x - (a + x) = b - a` which simplifies to `b - a = x`.

### Finding an Example Case:
If we take the input `a = 8` and `b = 13`:
- The expected snow cover `x` should be `13 - 8 = 5`.
- However, using the program's formula, we compute:
  ```
  (13 - 8) * (13 - 8 - 1) / 2 - 8
  = 5 * 4 / 2 - 8 
  = 10 - 8 
  = 2.
  ```
- This does not yield the expected result of `5` for the snow cover.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the height of the snow cover based on the problem requirements, as demonstrated by the example. 

Correctness: **False**.
