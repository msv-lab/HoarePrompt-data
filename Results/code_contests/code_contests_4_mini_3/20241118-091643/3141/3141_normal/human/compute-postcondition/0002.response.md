The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers that satisfy the constraints 1 <= a < b < 499500. The function's output is not explicitly provided in the prompt, so we cannot describe what it returns without additional information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= a < b < 499500.**
