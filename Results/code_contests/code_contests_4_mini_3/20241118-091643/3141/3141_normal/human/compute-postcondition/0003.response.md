Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, read from input, where `1 <= a < b < 499500`. It calculates and prints the result of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`, which computes a specific mathematical value based on the difference between `b` and `a`. However, the function does not handle cases where the input constraints are not met, such as `a` being greater than or equal to `b` or outside the specified range. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
