The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The function `map(int, raw_input().split())` converts the input into two integers and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are already defined as integers such that `1 <= a < b < 499500`, their exact values will change based on user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` and `b` are now the integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
