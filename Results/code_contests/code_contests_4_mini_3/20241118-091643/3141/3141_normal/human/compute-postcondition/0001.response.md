To analyze the provided Python code snippet, we start with the initial state where `a` is the first input integer and `b` is the second input integer. 

The code performs the following operations:
1. It calculates `b - a`, which is the difference between the two input integers.
2. It then computes `(b - a - 1)`, which is one less than the difference.
3. The product of `b - a` and `b - a - 1` is computed.
4. This product is divided by `2`.
5. Finally, `a` is subtracted from the result of the division.

The output from the `print` statement will yield the final computed value, but it does not affect the state of `a` or `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, along with the calculated expression.

Output State: **`a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, and the result of the calculation is `((b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a)`**.
