To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the program and its output hints carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine the depth of snow cover on two adjacent towers based on the heights that are not covered by snow (`a` for the west tower and `b` for the east tower). The heights of the towers are defined by the formula for triangular numbers, where the west tower's height is `a + x` and the east tower's height is `b + x`, assuming `x` is the depth of the snow cover. The program needs to correctly calculate `x`.

### Given Program:
```python
(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

### Output Hints:
The function reads two integers `a` and `b`, checks the constraints (1 â‰¤ a < b < 499500), and calculates the result based on the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`. The hints point out that it does not handle cases where the constraints are violated, nor does it return a value (it only prints the result).

### Assessment:
1. **Logic Check**: 
   - The calculation performed in the program seems to derive from the relationship between the heights of the towers and the snow cover.
   - However, upon deeper inspection, it appears that the formula used does not directly compute the snow cover depth. The correct relationship should be derived from the fact that the heights of the towers are defined by triangular numbers, and the snow depth would be derived as `x = height_of_tower - a` (for the west tower) and `x = height_of_tower - b` (for the east tower), leading to a more direct calculation.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program does not validate the inputs against the constraints adequately; while it assumes they are always satisfied, there are no checks or error handling.
   - The formula used does not account for the correct calculation of `x`. For example, given `a = 8` and `b = 13`, the expected snow cover should be 2, but the formula `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` does not yield the correct result in all cases.

3. **Output Hints Validation**: 
   - The output hints claim that the function does not handle invalid inputs and only prints the result. This aligns with the observations about the program's lack of input validation.
   - The hints also suggest that the calculation is based on differences rather than the actual heights of the towers, which is misleading as it could lead to incorrect results for some inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case, especially in terms of the calculations and handling of inputs. For instance, the program might output incorrect snow cover values based on the given inputs due to the flawed formula used.

Correctness: **False**.
