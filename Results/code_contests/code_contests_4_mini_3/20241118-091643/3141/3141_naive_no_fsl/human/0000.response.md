To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem states that we have two adjacent towers with heights represented by the lengths above the snow (given as `a` for the west tower and `b` for the east tower). We need to find the snow cover depth `x`. The height of the west tower is `h1 = a + x`, and the height of the east tower is `h2 = b + x`. Given that the heights of the towers are based on the triangular number sequence (1, 3, 6, ..., 499500), the heights of the towers can be expressed as:

- West tower height: `h1 = 1 + 2 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2` for some `n`
- East tower height: `h2 = 1 + 2 + ... + (n + 1) = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2`

From the problem description, we can derive that the difference in heights (including snow) gives us the equation:

`(b + x) - (a + x) = b - a`

To find the snow depth `x`, we can rearrange the heights:

1. From the west tower: `x = h1 - a`
2. From the east tower: `x = h2 - b`

To find `x` based on the heights, we can derive the formula as:

`x = (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`

Now, letâ€™s evaluate the program:

```python
(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Integer Division**: The program uses `/`, which in Python 2 performs floating-point division. Since we are dealing with integer values, we should use `//` for integer division to ensure that the result is an integer.
   
2. **Range of Results**: The program does not check if the computed depth `x` is at least 1 meter as required by the problem constraints. If `x` is calculated to be less than 1, the program would output an incorrect result.

### Test Case:

Let's check the test case where the values of `a` and `b` are such that the computed snow cover depth is less than 1:

- If we take `a = 8` and `b = 13`, the expected output is `2`, which the program correctly computes.
- However, if we take `a = 999` and `b = 1001`, the program would compute:
  
  ```python
  x = (1001 - 999) * (1001 - 999 - 1) / 2 - 999
  x = 2 * 1 / 2 - 999 = 1 - 999 = -998
  ```
  
  Here, the computed `x` is `-998`, which violates the requirement that snow cover must be at least 1 meter.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program fails to handle cases where the computed snow depth is less than 1 meter, thus violating the problem constraints.

Correctness: **False**.
