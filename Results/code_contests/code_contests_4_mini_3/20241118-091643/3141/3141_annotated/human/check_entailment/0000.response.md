To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the provided code and see if it correctly computes the depth of snow cover based on the inputs.

The problem describes that we have two adjacent towers with exposed heights `a` and `b`, and we need to calculate the depth of the snow cover `x`. The height of the towers is given by the formula for triangular numbers, specifically the heights are 1, 3, 6, ..., up to 499500, which corresponds to the sum of the first 999 natural numbers.

The annotated code is as follows:
```python
def func():
    a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

### Key Steps in the Program:
1. It reads two integers `a` and `b` from input.
2. It calculates the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
1. The difference `b - a` represents the height difference between the two adjacent towers.
2. The expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2` seems to be attempting to calculate a specific value based on that height difference, but it's not clear if this directly gives the depth of snow cover `x`.
3. The subtraction of `a` appears to try and adjust the result, but the logic behind this calculation is not aligned with the problem description.

### Checking against provided examples:
1. For the input `8 13`:
   - Expected output: `2`
   - The program computes: `(13 - 8) * (13 - 8 - 1) / 2 - 8 = (5 * 4 / 2) - 8 = 10 - 8 = 2` (This matches the expected output).
   
2. For the input `54 65`:
   - Expected output: `1`
   - The program computes: `(65 - 54) * (65 - 54 - 1) / 2 - 54 = (11 * 10 / 2) - 54 = 55 - 54 = 1` (This also matches the expected output).

### Edge Case:
To further verify the correctness, we can consider an edge case:
- For input `1 3`:
  - Expected output: `1` (since the heights would be `3` and `2`, and if the snow covers height `1`, it aligns perfectly).
  - The program computes: `(3 - 1) * (3 - 1 - 1) / 2 - 1 = (2 * 1 / 2) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0` (This does NOT match the expected output).

### Conclusion:
Based on this analysis, the program fails to compute the correct depth of snow cover in some cases, specifically with the edge case of `1 3`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
