The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which accepts a string of space-separated integers and splits them into two variables. Given the constraints that `1 <= a < b < 499500`, the state of `a` and `b` will change based on the input values. Other variables are not affected, so the output state depends on the specific values inputted for `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers assigned from input values such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500**
