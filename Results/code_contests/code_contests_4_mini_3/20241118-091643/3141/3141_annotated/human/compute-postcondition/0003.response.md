Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` through user input, where it is assumed that 1 <= a < b < 499500. It calculates and prints the result of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the output. There are no checks for the constraints on the input values, which could lead to errors if the input is not as expected. **
