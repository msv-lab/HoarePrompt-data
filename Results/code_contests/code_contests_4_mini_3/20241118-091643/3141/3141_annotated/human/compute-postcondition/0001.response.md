To analyze the provided code snippet, we first note that `a` and `b` are integers, with the constraints that `1 <= a < b < 499500`. 

The expression to evaluate is `print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`.

1. **Calculate `b - a`:** Since `b` is greater than `a`, the difference `b - a` is a positive integer.
2. **Calculate `(b - a - 1)`:** This is one less than the difference calculated in the first step, which is also a positive integer.
3. **Multiply the two results:** The product `(b - a) * (b - a - 1)` gives us a value that represents a triangular number based on the difference between `b` and `a`.
4. **Divide by `2`:** This takes the result of the multiplication and scales it down, potentially resulting in a float or integer depending on the value of `b - a`.
5. **Subtract `a`:** Finally, we subtract the value of `a` from the previous result.

The output of this expression will be printed directly, but since we are tasked with providing the output state, we will summarize the final values based on the computations above. The specific values of `a` and `b` are not given, so we cannot calculate a numeric result.

Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship between `a` and `b` and the final computed expression:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500; result is calculated as (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a**
