Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of shuffling operations or to check if moving from position `s` to `t` is possible. Instead, it simply computes the difference between the sums of two inputs, which is unrelated to the problem description. 

For example, if we consider the input:
```
4 2 1
2 3 4 1
```
The expected output is `3`, as it takes three shuffles to move the marble from position `2` to `1`. However, the program will output `0`, because it is incorrectly performing a sum operation rather than simulating the shuffling process.

Therefore, it does not handle the problem as described, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
