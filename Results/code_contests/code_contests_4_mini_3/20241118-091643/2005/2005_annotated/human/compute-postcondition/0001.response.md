The code snippet `print - (sum(IN()) - sum(IN()))` involves reading input twice using the `IN()` lambda function, converting the inputs to integers, summing them, and then performing a subtraction between the two sums. 

1. The first `sum(IN())` reads a list of integers from input and calculates their sum. Let's call this sum `A`.
2. The second `sum(IN())` reads another list of integers from input and calculates their sum. Let's call this sum `B`.
3. The expression then evaluates to `-(A - B)`, which equals `B - A`.
4. The final output is printed as the negated result of the subtraction.

Since the initial state does not specify the actual input values, the output state will reflect the relationship between the two sums rather than specific numeric values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of glasses, `s` and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s`, `t` ≤ `n`, and the output is the result of `B - A` where `A` is the sum of the first input and `B` is the sum of the second input.**
