The function `func` accepts three types of inputs: 

1. A parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of glasses.
2. Two parameters, `s` and `t`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ s, t ≤ n.
3. A list of `n` distinct integers that represent the shuffling operation parameters (p1, p2, ..., pn), where each pi satisfies 1 ≤ pi ≤ n.

After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs based on the shuffling operations and returns the final state of the glasses after the specified operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of glasses, two integers `s` and `t` indicating positions, and a list of `n` distinct integers for shuffling operations. It returns the final arrangement of the glasses after applying the shuffling operations.**
