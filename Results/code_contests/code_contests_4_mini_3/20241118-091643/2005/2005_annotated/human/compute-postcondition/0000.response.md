The code defines a lambda function `IN` that takes no arguments and returns a map object that converts the input values from `raw_input()` into integers. The initial state does not provide specific values for `n`, `s`, `t`, or the list of integers (p1, p2, ..., pn). Since `IN` does not modify any variables directly but prepares to read input, the output state reflects that the program is ready to accept input based on the defined lambda function.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of glasses, `s` and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s`, `t` ≤ `n`, and `IN` is a lambda function ready to read and convert input integers.**
