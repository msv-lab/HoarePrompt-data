Functionality: ** The function reads two sets of integers from input, calculates the difference between their sums, and prints the negative of that difference. It does not accept parameters or return a final arrangement of glasses, as suggested in the annotations. Additionally, there are no validations for input format or handling of edge cases such as empty input or non-integer values.**
