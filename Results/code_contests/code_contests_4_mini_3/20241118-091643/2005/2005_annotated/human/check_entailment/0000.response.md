Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It attempts to calculate the difference between the sums of two input lines, which is irrelevant to the problem of determining the number of shuffling operations needed to move a marble from position `s` to position `t`.

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. The problem requires tracking the position of a marble as it moves through a sequence of glasses based on the shuffle operations provided. The final output should be the minimum number of operations needed to get from `s` to `t`, or `-1` if it is impossible. 

2. The logic in the program (`print - (sum(IN()) - sum(IN()))`) does not correspond to any valid operations or checks related to the glasses and their positions. Instead, it just calculates a mathematical difference between two sums, which does not help in ascertaining the movement of the marble.

3. The program does not account for cases where `s` equals `t` and should return `0`, nor does it implement any mechanism to compute the shuffle operations based on the input list provided.

For example, if we input:
```
4 2 1
2 3 4 1
```
The correct output should be `3`, as it takes 3 moves to shuffle from position 2 to position 1. However, the program would produce a nonsensical output based on the incorrect calculation it performs.

Therefore, since the program fails to solve the problem as described for all potential cases, it is deemed incorrect.
