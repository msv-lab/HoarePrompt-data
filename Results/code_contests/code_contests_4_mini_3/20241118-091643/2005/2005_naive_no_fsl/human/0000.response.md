Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The problem requires determining the minimum number of shuffling operations needed to move a marble from position `s` to position `t` given the shuffling mapping. However, the program simply computes the difference of the sums of two inputs, which is not related to the shuffling operations or the positions of the glasses.

For instance, consider the following input case:

```
4 2 1
2 3 4 1
```

The expected output is `3`, as it takes three operations to move the marble from position `2` to position `1`. However, the program will not calculate this correctly and will yield an incorrect result.

Since the program does not handle the logic of shuffling or tracking the marble's movement, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement, making it incorrect.
