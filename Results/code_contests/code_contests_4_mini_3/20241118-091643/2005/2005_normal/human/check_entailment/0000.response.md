The provided program is intended to solve a problem involving shuffling glasses and determining the minimum number of operations required to move a marble from one position to another. However, the implementation does not reflect the requirements of the problem description.

Let's analyze the program:

```python
IN = lambda : map(int, raw_input().split())
print - (sum(IN()) - sum(IN()))
```

### Initial Assessment

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two lines of input but does not handle them according to the problem's requirements. It simply sums the integers from both lines and prints the negative difference. This does not relate to the glass positions or the shuffling operations defined in the problem.

2. **Logic**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of shuffles needed to move a marble from position `s` to position `t` based on a provided permutation of positions. The current implementation does not implement any logic to track the movement of the marble or count shuffles.

### Edge Cases

- If `s` is equal to `t`, the expected output should be `0` (no shuffles needed). The current code does not return this value.
- If it is impossible to reach `t` from `s`, the expected output should be `-1`. The current code has no mechanism to check for this condition.
- The problem description guarantees that all `p_i` values are distinct, but this is irrelevant to the logic currently implemented.

### Output Hints

The output hints state that the function computes the negative difference of the sums of two input lines. This does not align with the problem's requirement of tracking the movement of the marble and counting the shuffles. The hints suggest that the function does not handle cases related to positions of glasses or shuffling, which is a direct contradiction to what the problem is asking for.

### Conclusion

The program does not follow the problem description as it fails to implement the necessary logic to determine the minimum shuffles or handle special cases like when `s` equals `t` or when the marble cannot reach `t`. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements for correctness.

Correctness: **False**.
