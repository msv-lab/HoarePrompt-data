The code defines a lambda function `IN` that takes input from the user, splits it into separate values, and converts those values into integers. The initial state describes variables `n`, `s`, `t`, and a list of distinct integers representing the shuffling operation parameters `pi`. However, the code itself does not change any values or states of `n`, `s`, `t`, or `pi`. It only sets up a function to read input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of glasses, `s` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= s, t <= n, and `pi` are n distinct integers representing the shuffling operation parameters.**
