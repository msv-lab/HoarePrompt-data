Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads two lines of input, each consisting of space-separated integers. It computes the difference between the sums of the integers from both lines and prints the negative of that difference. The function does not specifically handle any cases related to the positions of glasses or their shuffling, despite the annotations suggesting such functionality. Therefore, it simply outputs the negative difference of the sums of two lists of integers. **
