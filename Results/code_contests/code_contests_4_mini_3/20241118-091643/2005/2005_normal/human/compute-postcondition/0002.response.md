The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but operates on the following constraints: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of glasses; `s` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= s, t <= n; and the second input consists of `n` distinct integers representing the shuffling operation parameters `pi`, where 1 <= pi <= n. 

Based on the output description, the function performs a shuffling operation on the glasses and returns the final position of the glass initially at position `s` after the shuffling process defined by the parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine the final position of a specified glass after a series of shuffling operations defined by a list of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but operates on a positive integer n representing the number of glasses, integers s and t for specific glass positions, and a list of n distinct integers for shuffling. It returns the final position of the glass initially at position s after the shuffling.**
