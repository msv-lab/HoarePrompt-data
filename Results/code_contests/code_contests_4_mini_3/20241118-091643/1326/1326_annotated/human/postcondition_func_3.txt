The function accepts a non-negative integer `N` and processes a list `P` obtained from `func_3`. It attempts to build two lists `a` and `b` starting with an initial value of 100,000. It iterates through the elements of `P` in reverse order, adding elements to `a` or `b` based on specified conditions. If any element in `P` is greater than the last elements of both `a` and `b`, the process is terminated with a failure flag set to True. After processing, if the length of `a` does not equal `N + 1`, the function indicates failure by printing 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not handle cases where `N` is negative or if `P` is not provided as expected.
