The list `b` is appended with the value of `c`. The initial state of `b` is [100000], and `c` can either be greater than 100000 or less than or equal to 100000. Therefore, after appending, the possible states of `b` can be either [100000, c] if `c` is greater than 100000 or [100000, c] if `c` is less than or equal to 100000. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing either [100000, c] or [100000]; `b` is either [100000, c] if `c` is greater than 100000 or [100000, c] if `c` is less than or equal to 100000; `P` is a list with at least one element; `fail` retains its previous state**
