The code appends the value of `c` (the last element of `P`) to the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` contains one element, which is 100000. After executing the code, the list `a` will contain two elements: the original 100000 and the value of `c`. The list `b` remains unaffected, and since `c` is not specified in the given state, it will be treated as an unknown value from list `P`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated contents of `a` and the unchanged state of `b` and other variables.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements [100000, c], `b` is a list containing one element [100000], `P` is a list with at least 1 element, `c` is the last element of `P`, and the length of `a` is now 2.**
