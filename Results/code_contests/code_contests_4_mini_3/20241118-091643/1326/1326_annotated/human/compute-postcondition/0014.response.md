`a` is a list containing one element `[100000]`. The code appends the value of `c` to the list `a`. Since `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, which is `100000`, the new state of `a` becomes `[100000, c]`. The other variables `b`, `P`, and `fail` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is `[100000, c]`, `b` is `[100000]`, `P` is a list with at least one element, `c` is greater than `100000`, and `fail` may be set to True or remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is [100000, c], `b` is [100000], `P` is a list with at least one element, `c` is greater than 100000, and `fail` may be set to True or remain unchanged.**
