Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that initially contains [100000]. If `a` has exactly one element, it is updated to [100000, c] where `c` is the next element from the reverse of `P`, `b` remains [100000] or becomes [100000, c], and `fail` retains its previous state. If `a` has more than one element, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `fail`.***
