Given the initial state where `a` is a list containing one element `[100000]`, and considering the condition that `c` is greater than the last element of `a` for the assignment to `b`, we know the following:

- If `c` is greater than `100000`, then `b` will be updated to `[100000, c]`.
- If `c` is not greater than `100000`, or if `a` has more than one element, there will be no changes to `a`, `b`, or `fail`.

The code `a.append(c)` will append the value of `c` to the list `a`. 

Therefore, since `a` is initially `[100000]`, after executing `a.append(c)`, the new state of `a` will be `[100000, c]`, regardless of the conditions described.

Output State: **`a` is [100000, c], `b` remains unchanged, `fail` remains unchanged**.
