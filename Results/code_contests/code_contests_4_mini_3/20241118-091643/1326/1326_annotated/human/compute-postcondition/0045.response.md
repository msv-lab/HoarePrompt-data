Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that contains [100000, c] if its original length was 1, while `b` remains [100000, next_value], `fail` retains its previous state, and `P` continues to have at least one additional element. If `a` had a length other than 1, the state of the program variables remains unchanged.***
