The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, and `fail` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a list containing [100000, c, c], `b` remains [100000, next_value], and `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last elements of lists `a` and `b`.**
