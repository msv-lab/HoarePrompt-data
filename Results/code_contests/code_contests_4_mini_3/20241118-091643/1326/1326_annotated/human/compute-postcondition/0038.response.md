Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that initially contains [100000]. If `a` has exactly one element and `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, then `b` is updated to [100000, c] or remains [100000], while `fail` retains its previous state and the execution continues to the next iteration. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, or if `a` has more than one element, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `fail`.***
