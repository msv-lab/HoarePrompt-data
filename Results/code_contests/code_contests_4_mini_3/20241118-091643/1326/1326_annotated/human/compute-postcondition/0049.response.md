The code `a.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the end of the list `a`. Given that `a` originally contains [100000, c] if its length was 1, after the execution, the list `a` will now contain three elements: [100000, c, c]. The other variable states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing [100000, c, c], `b` remains [100000, next_value], and `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last elements of lists `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing [100000, c, c], `b` remains [100000, next_value], and `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last elements of lists `a` and `b`.**
