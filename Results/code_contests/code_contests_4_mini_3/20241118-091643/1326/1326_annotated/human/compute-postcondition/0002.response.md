The value of `b` is assigned the list containing `10 ** 5`, which evaluates to `100000`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged as `[100000]`. The variable `P` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `a` and `b` while noting that `P` is not altered.

Output State: **`a` is [100000], `b` is [100000], and `P` is the result of func_3()**
