The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list that contains [100000, c], `b` remains [100000, next_value], `fail` is True, and `P` continues to have at least one additional element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
