The variable `fail` is assigned the value `False`, and it does not affect any other variables in the state. The values of `a`, `b`, and `P` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is [100000], `b` is [100000], `P` is the result of func_3(), and `fail` is False.

Output State: **`a` is [100000], `b` is [100000], `P` is the result of func_3(), and `fail` is False**
