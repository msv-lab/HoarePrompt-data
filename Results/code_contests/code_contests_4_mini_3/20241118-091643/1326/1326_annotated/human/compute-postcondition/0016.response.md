Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that originally contains one element [100000], `b` is a list containing one element [100000], and `P` is a list with at least one element. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a` (100000), then `a` is updated to [100000, c]; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged as [100000], and `fail` retains its previous state. If `c` is exactly equal to 100000 or less, `a` does not change and `fail` is not affected.***
