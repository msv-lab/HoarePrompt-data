Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that originally contains [100000]; `b` may either remain [100000] or be updated to include `c`, depending on whether the length of `b` and its last element are less than the length of `a` and its last element. If `b` is updated, it will contain [100000, c] where `c` is greater than 100000; if `b` remains unchanged, `c` is either 100000 or less, and `fail` retains its previous state throughout the execution. In the else case, `c` is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` containing [100000, c] while `b` remains [100000] and `fail` still retains its previous state.**
