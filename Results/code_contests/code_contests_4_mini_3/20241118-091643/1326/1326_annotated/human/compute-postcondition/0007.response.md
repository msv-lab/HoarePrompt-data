The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates skipping the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list containing two elements [100000, c], `b` is a list containing one element [100000], `P` is a list with at least 1 element, `c` is the last element of `P`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
