The loop processes elements from list `P` in reverse order, appending values to lists `a` and `b` based on certain conditions. Initially, `a` contains one element, 100000, and `b` also contains 100000. The variable `fail` is initially set to False.

1. If `P` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains [100000], `b` remains [100000], and `fail` remains False.
2. If `P` is not empty, the loop executes for each element `c` in `P`:
   - If `len(a) == 1`, `c` is appended to `a`. This will occur for the first element processed.
   - If `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, `fail` is set to True, and the loop breaks.
   - If `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, `c` is appended to `a`.
   - If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, `c` is appended to `b`.
   - If the length of `b` and its last element are less than the length of `a` and its last element, `c` is appended to `b`; otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`.

Thus, the output state must account for various scenarios depending on the values in `P`, particularly in relation to the fixed values in `a` and `b`.

Output State: **If P is empty, `a` is [100000], `b` is [100000], and `fail` is False. If P is not empty, `a` may contain additional elements depending on the values of `c` as they are processed. If any `c` is greater than both `a[-1]` and `b[-1]`, `fail` is True, and the loop stops. Otherwise, `a` and `b` will be updated based on the conditions outlined, and their final states will depend on the values in `P`.**
