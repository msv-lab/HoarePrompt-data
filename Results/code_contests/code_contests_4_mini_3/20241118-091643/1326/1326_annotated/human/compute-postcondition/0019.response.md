The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing either [100000, c] or [100000]; `b` is either [100000, c] if `c` is greater than 100000 or [100000, c] if `c` is less than or equal to 100000; `P` is a list with at least one element; `fail` retains its previous state and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
