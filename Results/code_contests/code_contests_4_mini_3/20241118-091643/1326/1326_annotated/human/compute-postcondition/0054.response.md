Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that contains [100000, c] if its original length was 1. If `c` is greater than `b[-1]`, then `c` is appended to `b`, resulting in `b` containing [100000, next_value, c]. The variable `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last elements of lists `a` and `b`. If `a` had a length other than 1, the state of the program variables remains unchanged.***
