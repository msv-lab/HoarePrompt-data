Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that originally contains one element [100000]. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` (the last element of `P`) is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` being [100000, c]. If the length of `a` is not 1, this branch does not execute, and `a` remains unchanged. `b` is a list containing one element [100000], and `P` is a list with at least one element. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
