The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list containing two elements [100000, c], `b` is a list containing one element [100000], `P` is a list with at least one element, and `fail` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
