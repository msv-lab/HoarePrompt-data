Postcondition: ***If P is empty, `a` is a list containing 100000, `b` is a list containing 100000, and `fail` is False. If P is not empty, `a` may contain additional elements depending on the values of `c`. The length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`. If any `c` is greater than both `a[-1]` and `b[-1]`, `fail` is True; otherwise, `fail` remains unchanged.***
