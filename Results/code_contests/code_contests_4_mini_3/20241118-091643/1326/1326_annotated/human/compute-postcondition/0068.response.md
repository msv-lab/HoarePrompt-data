The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`. `N` consists of multiple test cases, where each test case has a non-negative integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) followed by a permutation `p` of length `2n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `2n`. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2000. 

Based on the output specifics provided, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to handle multiple test cases based on the input parameters specified. However, the exact return value for each test case is not detailed in the provided output information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases consisting of a non-negative integer n followed by a permutation p of length 2n containing distinct integers from 1 to 2n. It processes these test cases while ensuring the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2000.**
