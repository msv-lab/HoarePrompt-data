The code snippet appends the value of `c` to the list `b`. The impact of this operation depends on the current state of `b`. If `a` originally had a length of 1, then `b` would have been updated to include `c` based on the conditional logic described. 

1. If `a` has a length of 1, the original state of `b` is [100000, next_value]. After executing `b.append(c)`, the new state of `b` will be [100000, next_value, c].
2. If `a` had a length other than 1, the operation does not affect the state of `b`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the condition of `b` depending on the length of `a`.

Output State: **If `a` has length 1: `b` is [100000, next_value, c]. If `a` has a length other than 1: `b` remains unchanged.**
