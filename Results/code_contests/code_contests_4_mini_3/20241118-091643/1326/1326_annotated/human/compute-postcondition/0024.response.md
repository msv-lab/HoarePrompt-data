The `append` method adds the element `c` to the end of the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list containing `[100000]`, so after appending `c`, `a` will contain `[100000, c]`. Other variables (`b`, `P`, and `fail`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list containing `[100000, c]`, `b` is a list that remains `[100000]`, `P` is a list with at least one element, and `fail` retains its previous state.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing `[100000, c]`, `b` is a list that remains `[100000]`, `P` is a list with at least one element, `fail` retains its previous state**.
