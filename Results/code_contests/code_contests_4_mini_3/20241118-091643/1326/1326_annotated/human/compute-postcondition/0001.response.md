The variable `a` is assigned a list containing a single element, which is `10 ** 5` (or 100000). The initial state specifies that the output value of `P` is the result of processing through the function `func_3()`, but the computation within that function is not provided here, leaving `P` undefined. The state of `a` is clearly defined. 

Thus, the output state reflects the known value of `a` and the undefined nature of `P`:

Output State: **`a` is [100000], and `P` is the result of func_3()**
