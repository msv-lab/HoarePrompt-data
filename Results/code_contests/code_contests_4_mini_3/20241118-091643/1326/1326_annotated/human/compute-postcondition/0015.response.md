The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `P`, `c`, and `fail` remain unchanged, the output state reflects that there is no modification to the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is [100000, c], `b` is [100000], `P` is a list with at least one element, `c` is greater than 100000, and `fail` may be set to True or remain unchanged.
