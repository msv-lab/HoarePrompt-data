Postcondition: ***If `fail` is True, the function prints 'NO', indicating that either the length of list `a` is not equal to `N + 1` or a value of `c` was greater than both `a[-1]` and `b[-1]`. If `fail` is False, the length of list `a` is equal to `N + 1`, and the function prints 'YES', indicating that the conditions for failure were not met and that `a` and `b` may contain additional elements.***
