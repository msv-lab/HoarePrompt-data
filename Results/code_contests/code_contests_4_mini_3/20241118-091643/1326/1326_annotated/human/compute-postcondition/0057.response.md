Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that originally contained [100000, c] if its length was 1, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `c` is greater than `b[-1]`, then `c` is appended to `b`, resulting in `b` containing [100000, next_value, c]. If the length of `b` is less than that of `a` and the last element of `b` is less than that of `a`, then `c` is appended to `b`. If not, `c` is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` containing either [100000, c] or [100000, c, c] depending on its original length. The variable `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last elements of lists `a` and `b`.***
