Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases, and the function `func_3()` processes these test cases to produce a result assigned to `P`. The specific output value of `P` is determined by the implementation of `func_3()`, but it is not specified here. Therefore, `P` is the result of `func_3()`.**
