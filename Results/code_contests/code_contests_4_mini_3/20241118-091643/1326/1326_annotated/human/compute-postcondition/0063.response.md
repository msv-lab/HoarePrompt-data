Postcondition: ***`a` contains [100000] and `b` contains [100000], `fail` is True. If the length of `a` is equal to `N + 1`, then `a` and `b` may contain additional elements depending on the processing of `c`, and `fail` remains False unless a value of `c` was greater than both `a[-1]` and `b[-1]` beforehand, which would set `fail` to True.***
