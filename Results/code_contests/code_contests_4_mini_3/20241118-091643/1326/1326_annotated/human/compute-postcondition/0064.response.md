The code prints 'NO', and it does not change the values of `a`, `b`, or `fail`. The previous state indicates that `a` contains [100000], `b` contains [100000], and `fail` is True. Therefore, the output state is: `a` contains [100000], `b` contains [100000], `fail` is True, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`a` contains [100000], `b` contains [100000], `fail` is True, and the function prints 'NO'**
