Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that contains [100000, c] if its original length was 1, while `b` remains [100000, next_value], `fail` is set to True when `c` is greater than both the last elements of lists `a` and `b`, causing an exit from the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` had a length other than 1, the state of the program variables remains unchanged.***
