The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables and instead skips the current iteration of the loop, if one is in context. Since no values of `a`, `b`, or `fail` are altered by this command, the output state reflects their previous states.

Output State: **`a` is a list that initially contains [100000]; `b` is updated to [100000, c] or remains [100000]; `fail` retains its previous state and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
