The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next one. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables.

Output State: **`a` is [100000, c], `b` is [100000, next_value], `fail` retains its previous state, and `P` has at least one additional element, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
