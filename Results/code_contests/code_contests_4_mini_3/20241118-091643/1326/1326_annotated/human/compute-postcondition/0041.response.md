Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that initially contains [100000]. If `c` is greater than 100000, then `b` is updated to [100000, c] and `fail` retains its previous state. If `c` is not greater than 100000, then `b` remains unchanged and `fail` retains its previous state. If `a` has more than one element, `b` and `fail` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to include `c`.***
