The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list that contains [100000, c], `b` is [100000, next_value, c], `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last elements of lists `a` and `b`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
