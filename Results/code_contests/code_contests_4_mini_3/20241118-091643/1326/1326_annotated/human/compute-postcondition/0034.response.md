The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instructs the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since we do not have information on the state of the loop or the previous values of `fail`, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`a` is a list that initially contains [100000, c]; `b` is [100000, c] or remains [100000]; `fail` retains its previous state, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
