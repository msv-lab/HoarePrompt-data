Postcondition: ***`a` is a list that originally contains [100000]; `b` is a list that may be updated to include `c` if `c` is greater than the last element of `b` (100000), resulting in `b` being either [100000, c] or remaining [100000]; `P` is a list with at least one element; `fail` retains its previous state, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is exactly 100000 or less, `a` and `b` remain unchanged and `fail` is not affected.***
