t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) representing the length of arrays a and b; and p is a permutation of 2n integers where each integer p_i (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 2n) is distinct. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2000.
