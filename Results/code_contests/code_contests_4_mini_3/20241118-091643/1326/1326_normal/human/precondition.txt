t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) representing the length of the two arrays a and b; p is a permutation of length 2n containing 2n distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 2n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2000.
