Postcondition: ***If the length of list `b` and its last element are less than the length of list `a` and its last element, then `c` is appended to `b`, leaving `a`, `b`, and `fail` unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`, while `a`, `b`, and `fail` remain unchanged. If `b` has a length of 1, `c` is also appended to `b` without modifying `fail`, and in all other cases, `a`, `b`, and `fail` remain unchanged as the program proceeds.***
