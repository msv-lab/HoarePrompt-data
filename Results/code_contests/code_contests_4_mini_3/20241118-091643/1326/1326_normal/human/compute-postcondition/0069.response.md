Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer N and processes a list P, which is expected to contain 2N distinct integers. It attempts to construct a list `a` with N + 1 elements based on conditions applied to the elements of P. If the length of `a` after processing does not equal N + 1, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. However, the function does not return any value, and it relies on external function `func_3()` to populate the list P. If the initial conditions are not met or if P is empty, the behavior may lead to unexpected results. **
