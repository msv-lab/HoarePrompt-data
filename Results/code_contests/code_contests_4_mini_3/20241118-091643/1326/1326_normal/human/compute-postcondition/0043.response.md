The operation `a.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the end of the list `a`. Since `c` is defined as the second last element in `P`, the state of `a` will change to include this new element. The variables `b` and `fail` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` has a new element `c` appended; `b` is unchanged; `fail` is unchanged; `P` has at least 2 elements; `c` is the second last element in `P`.

Output State: **`a` has a new element `c` appended; `b` is unchanged; `fail` is unchanged; `P` has at least 2 elements; `c` is the second last element in `P.**
