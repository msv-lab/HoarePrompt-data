Postcondition: ***`a` remains unchanged unless it initially contained exactly one element, in which case `c` is appended to `a`. `b` remains unchanged; if `c` is greater than `a[-1]`, then `c` is appended to `a`. If `c` is less than or equal to either `a[-1]` or `b[-1]`, no changes occur to `fail` or the control flow, and `fail` is set to True if `c` is appended to `a`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `P` has at least 2 elements with `c` being the second last element in `P`.***
