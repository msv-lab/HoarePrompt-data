The `continue` statement does not modify the values of any variables but is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop. Since there is no information provided about the current iteration or the loop context in which this code is executed, the output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the last element of `P`, the length of `a` is now 2, and `c` has been appended to `a`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
