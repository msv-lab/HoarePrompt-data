Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, and `c` is the last element of `P`. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `a`, and the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `fail`. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, there are no changes to `a` or `fail` and the program proceeds normally. Additionally, if the length of `a` is 1 and `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, `fail` would be set to True, but since `c` is appended to `a`, this scenario does not apply. Thus, `a` may or may not include `c`, depending on the comparison, while `fail` remains unchanged unless explicitly set otherwise in the program context.***
