Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the second to last element of `P`, and if the length of `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If the length of `a` is not 1, no changes are made to `a` in this iteration of the loop.***
