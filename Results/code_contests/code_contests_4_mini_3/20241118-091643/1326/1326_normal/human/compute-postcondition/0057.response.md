Postcondition: ***If the length of `b` and its last element are less than the length of `a` and its last element, `c` is appended to `b`, and if `a` initially contained exactly one element, `c` is also appended to `a`. If `c` is greater than `b[-1]`, `c` is appended to `b`. If `c` is less than or equal to either `a[-1]` or `b[-1]`, no changes occur to `fail`, which is set to True if `c` is appended to `a`. If the condition is not met, `a` remains unchanged unless it initially had one element, in which case `c` is appended to `a`, `b` remains unchanged, and `fail` may be set to True under the same circumstances. The variable `P` contains at least 2 elements, with `c` being the second last element in `P`, and the `continue` statement does not alter the program state.***
