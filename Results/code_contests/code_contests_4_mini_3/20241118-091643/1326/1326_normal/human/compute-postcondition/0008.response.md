Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the last element of `P`, and if the length of `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a`, making the length of `a` equal to 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If the length of `a` is not 1, there are no changes made to `a`.***
