The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`. `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2000\). The function also operates on a list `P` of `2N` distinct integers, where each integer satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq 2N\). 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the input parameter `N`, it can be described that the function handles a list of integers derived from `N`. 

Without specific return values outlined in the output, we can't define the functionality completely. However, generally, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2000) and operates on a list P of 2N distinct integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 2N). The specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
