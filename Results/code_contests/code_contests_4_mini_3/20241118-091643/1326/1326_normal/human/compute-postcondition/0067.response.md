Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers that remains unchanged if the length of `a` is equal to `N + 1`. If the length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, then `fail` is set to True, indicating that the conditions applied to `c` did not result in the expected number of elements in `a`, and 'NO' is printed. If the loop does not execute, `a` remains [100000], `b` remains [100000], and `fail` remains False, resulting in 'YES' being printed.***
