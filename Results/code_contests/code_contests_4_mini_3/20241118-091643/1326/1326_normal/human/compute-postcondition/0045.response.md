Postcondition: ***`a` is unchanged unless it initially had exactly one element, in which case `c` is appended to `a`. `b` is unchanged, `fail` is unchanged, and `P` has at least 2 elements with `c` being the second last element in `P`. If the length of `a` is 1, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
