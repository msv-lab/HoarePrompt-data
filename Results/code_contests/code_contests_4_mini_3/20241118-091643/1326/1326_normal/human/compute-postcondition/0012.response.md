Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the last element of `P`. If `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, then `fail` is set to True, and the program exits the most internal loop or statement without making any changes to `a`. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` would have been appended to `a`, but in this case, there are no changes to `a` since the condition of the if statement is satisfied. If `c` is not greater than the last elements of `a` and `b`, the program continues without changing `fail` or `a`.***
