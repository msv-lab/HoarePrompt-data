Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, and `c` is the second to last element of `P`. If the length of `a` is not 1 and `c` is greater than both the last elements of `a` and `b`, then `fail` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` is appended to `a` and the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `fail`. In all other cases, no changes are made to `fail`.***
