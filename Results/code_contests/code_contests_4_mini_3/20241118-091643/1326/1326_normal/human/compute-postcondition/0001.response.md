The code assigns the list `a` with a single value of `10 ** 5`, which evaluates to `100000`. The variables `N` and `P` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N; `a` is [100000]**
