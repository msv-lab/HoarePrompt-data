The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `N`, `P`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the second to last element of `P`, and `a` now contains `c` appended to it, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
