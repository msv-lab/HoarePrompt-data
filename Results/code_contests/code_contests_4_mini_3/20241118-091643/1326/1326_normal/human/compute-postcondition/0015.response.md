The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop in which `continue` is called. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, reflecting the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the last element of `P`, `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, `fail` is set to True, and `a` now includes `c` at the end, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
