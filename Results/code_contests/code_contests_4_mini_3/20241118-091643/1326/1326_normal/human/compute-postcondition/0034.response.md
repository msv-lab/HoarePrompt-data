The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the second to last element of `P`, `c` is appended to `a`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
