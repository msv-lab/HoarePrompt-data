Postcondition: ***`a` remains unchanged unless it initially contained exactly one element, in which case `c` is appended to `a`. `b` remains unchanged; if `c` is greater than `b[-1]`, then `c` is appended to `b`. If `c` is less than or equal to either `a[-1]` or `b[-1]`, no changes occur to `fail`; `fail` is set to True if `c` is appended to `a`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `P` has at least 2 elements with `c` being the second last element in `P`. The `continue` statement does not change the state of the program.***
