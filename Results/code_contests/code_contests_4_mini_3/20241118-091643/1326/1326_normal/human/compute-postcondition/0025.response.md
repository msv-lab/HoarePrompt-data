Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, and `c` is the last element of `P`. If the length of `b` and the last element of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `a`, then `b` includes `c` and remains unchanged, while `fail` is unchanged. If this condition is not met, then `b` remains unchanged, `fail` remains unchanged, and `c` is appended to `a`. Additionally, if `a` has only one element, the conditions regarding `c`'s relationship with `a` and `b` do not apply, as `c` would have been appended to `b` instead.***
