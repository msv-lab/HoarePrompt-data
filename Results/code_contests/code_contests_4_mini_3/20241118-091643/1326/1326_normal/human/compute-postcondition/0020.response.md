Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the last element of `P`. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, `c` is appended to `b`, and the execution continues without changing `fail`. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `b`, there are no changes to `b` or `fail`, and the program proceeds normally. Thus, `b` may include `c` depending on the comparison, while `fail` remains unchanged unless explicitly set elsewhere in the program context. Additionally, if `a` has only one element, the conditions involving `c`’s relationship with `a` and `b` do not apply in this case since `c` would have been appended to `b`.***
