Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the last element of `P`, `b` remains unchanged, `fail` remains unchanged, and either `len(b)` is greater than or equal to `len(a)` or the last element of `b` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`. If `a` has only one element, the conditions involving `c`’s relationship with `a` and `b` do not apply since `c` would have been appended to `b`.***
