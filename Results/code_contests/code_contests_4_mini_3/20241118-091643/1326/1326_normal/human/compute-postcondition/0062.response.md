Postcondition: ***After executing the program fragment, if the length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, then `fail` is set to True, indicating that the conditions applied to `c` did not result in the expected number of elements in `a`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `b` may contain elements if the conditions were met during the loop execution, and `fail` retains its value based on whether `c` was greater than both last elements in `a`. If the loop does not execute, `a` remains [100000], `b` remains [100000], and `fail` remains False.***
