The operation `b.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the list `b`. Since `c` is the last element of `P`, and it is stated that `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, the value of `c` will be added to `b`. The previous state of `b` is unchanged until this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of `c` to the list `b`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the last element of `P`, `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, `a` may or may not include `c`, `fail` remains unchanged, and `b` includes the new element `c`.**
