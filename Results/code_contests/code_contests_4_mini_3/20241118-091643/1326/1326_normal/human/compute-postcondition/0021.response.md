Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000), `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers with 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N, `c` is the last element of `P`, `b` is a list that may or may not include `c`, and `fail` remains unchanged. The length of `b` is less than the length of `a`, and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`. If `a` has only one element, the conditions involving `c`’s relationship with `a` and `b` do not apply.***
