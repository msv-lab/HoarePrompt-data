In the given code snippet, `b` is assigned the value of a list containing a single integer, which is `10 ** 5`. The value of `10 ** 5` is calculated as `100000`. The initial states of the variables `N`, `P`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2N; `a` is [100000]; `b` is [100000]**
