Postcondition: ***If `c` is greater than the last element of list `b`, then `c` is appended to `b` and the program continues to the next iteration without modifying `a` or `fail`. If the length of `b` is 1, `c` is also appended to `b`, and the loop continues without changing `fail`. In all other cases, `a`, `b`, and `fail` remain unchanged as the program proceeds without modifications.***
