Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary mapping each character in `layout1` to its index (0 to 25), `layout1` is exactly 26 characters long, `i` is 0, and `s` has length greater than 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is a digit, `Mods` is updated by appending the digit `s[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase version of the character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to the lowercase version of `s[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is a lowercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the value from `layout2` at the index corresponding to `s[i]`. In all cases, `Mods` reflects the transformation based on the character type of `s[i]` using the mappings defined by `dic` and `layout2`.***
