According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 1. The other states do not need to be adjusted since they are not dependent on the loop's condition.

State: **`layout1` is a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, `layout2` is an input string, `s` is an input string containing lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a length not exceeding 1000, `Mods` is an empty string, `dic` is `{layout1[0]: 0}`, `i` is 1**
