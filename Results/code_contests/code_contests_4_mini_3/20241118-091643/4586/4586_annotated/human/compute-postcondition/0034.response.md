Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary mapping each character in `layout1` to its index (0 to 25), `layout1` is exactly 26 characters long, `i` is 2, `s` has length greater than 1, and `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i` of `s`: if `s[i]` is a digit, `Mods` is appended with `s[i]`; if `s[i]` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated with the corresponding uppercase character from `layout2` based on the index of `s[i].lower()`; otherwise, if `s[i]` is lowercase, `Mods` is updated with the corresponding character from `layout2` based on the index of `s[i]`. This guarantees that `Mods` reflects the appropriate transformation of the character at index `i` of `s` while ensuring all cases, including digits, uppercase, and lowercase letters, are accounted for.***
