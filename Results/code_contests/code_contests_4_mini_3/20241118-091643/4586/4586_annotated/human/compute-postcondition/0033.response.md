Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary mapping each character in `layout1` to its index (0 to 25), `layout1` is exactly 26 characters long, `i` is 2, `s` has length greater than 1, and `Mods` is updated depending on the case of `s[i]`: if `s[i]` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated with the uppercase character from `layout2` corresponding to `s[i].lower()`, while if `s[i]` is lowercase, `Mods` is updated with the character from `layout2` corresponding to `s[i]`. This ensures that `Mods` will always contain the appropriate character from `layout2` based on the case of the character at index `i` in string `s`.***
