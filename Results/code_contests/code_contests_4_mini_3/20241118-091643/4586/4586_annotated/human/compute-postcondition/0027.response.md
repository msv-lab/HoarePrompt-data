Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary mapping each character in `layout1` to its index (0 to 25), `layout1` is exactly 26 characters long, `i` is 1, `s` has length greater than 1, and `Mods` is updated by appending a character from `layout2`. If the character at `s[i]` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated with the character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to `dic[s[i].lower()]` in uppercase. Otherwise, `Mods` is updated with the character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to `dic[s[i]]`. All conditions are strictly maintained, ensuring that `s[i]` is a valid character in `layout1`.***
