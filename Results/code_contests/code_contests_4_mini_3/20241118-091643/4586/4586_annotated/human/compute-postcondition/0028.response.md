Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary mapping each character in `layout1` to its index (0 to 25), `layout1` is exactly 26 characters long, `i` is 1, and `s` has length greater than 1. If `s[1]` is a digit, `Mods` is incremented by the digit `s[1]`. If `s[1]` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to `dic[s[1].lower()]` in uppercase. Otherwise, if `s[1]` is a lowercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to `dic[s[1]]`. All conditions ensure that `s[1]` is valid and handled correctly based on its type.***
