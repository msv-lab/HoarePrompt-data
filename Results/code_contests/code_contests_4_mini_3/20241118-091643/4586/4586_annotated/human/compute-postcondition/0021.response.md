Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary mapping each character in `layout1` to its index (0 to 25), `layout1` is exactly 26 characters long, `i` is 0, and `s` has length greater than 0, with the character `s[i]` not being a digit. If `s[i]` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase version of the character from `layout2` at the index corresponding to the lowercase version of `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is a lowercase letter, `Mods` is updated by adding the value from `layout2` at the index corresponding to `s[i]`. In both cases, `Mods` reflects the transformation based on the case of `s[i]` using the mappings defined by `dic` and `layout2`.***
