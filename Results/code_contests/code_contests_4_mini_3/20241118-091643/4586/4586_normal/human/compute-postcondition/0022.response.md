Postcondition: ***`dic` contains mappings from the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `s` is any string (can be empty or have characters), and `i` is 0. If `s[0]` is a digit, `Mods` is updated to include the digit `s[0]`. If `s[0]` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the character from `layout2` corresponding to `dic[s[0].lower()]`. If `s[0]` is a lowercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the value from `layout2` corresponding to `dic[s[0]]`. If `s` is empty, no changes are made to `Mods`. The overall state of `Mods` reflects these updates based on the nature of `s[0]`.***
