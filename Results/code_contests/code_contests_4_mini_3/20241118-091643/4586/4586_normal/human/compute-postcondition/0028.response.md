Postcondition: ***`dic` contains mappings from the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, and `s` has at least 1 character with `i` being 1. If `s[1]` is a digit, `Mods` now includes the character `s[1]`. If `s[1]` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase character derived from `layout2` using the mapping from `dic` based on the lowercase version of `s[1]`. If `s[1]` is lowercase, `Mods` is updated with the value from `layout2[dic[s[1]]]`. In all cases, `Mods` is modified according to the mapping defined in `dic` and the value of `s[1]`.***
