Postcondition: ***`dic` contains mappings from the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is a digit, `Mods` is increased by the value of `s[2]`. If `s[2]` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase value derived from `layout2[dic[s[2].lower()]]`. If `s[2]` is a lowercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the value derived from `layout2[dic[s[2]]]`. All cases are handled based on the character type of `s[2]`.***
