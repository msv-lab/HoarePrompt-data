The code `Mods += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the variable `Mods`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1, so it will access the second character of `s`. The variable `Mods` will now include this character. The previous values of `dic`, `layout1`, and the rest of `s` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `dic` contains mappings from the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `s` has at least 1 character, `i` is 1, and `Mods` now includes the character `s[1]`.

Output State: **`dic` contains mappings from the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `s` has at least 1 character, `i` is 1, and `Mods` now includes the character `s[1]`**
