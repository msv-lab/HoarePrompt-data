Postcondition: ***`dic` contains mappings from the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `s` has at least 1 character, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is uppercase, then `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase character derived from `layout2` using the mapping from `dic` based on the lowercase version of `s[i]`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is lowercase, then `Mods` is updated with the value from `layout2[dic[s[i]]]`. In both cases, `Mods` is modified according to the mapping defined in `dic` and the value of `s[i]`.***
