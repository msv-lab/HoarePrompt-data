Postcondition: ***`dic` contains mappings from the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, and `s` is any string (can be empty or have characters). If `s[i]` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the character from `layout2` corresponding to `dic[s[i].lower()]`. If `s[i]` is a lowercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the value from `layout2` corresponding to `dic[s[i]]`. The character `s[i]` is guaranteed not to be a digit, and the overall state of `Mods` reflects these updates based on the case of `s[i]`.***
