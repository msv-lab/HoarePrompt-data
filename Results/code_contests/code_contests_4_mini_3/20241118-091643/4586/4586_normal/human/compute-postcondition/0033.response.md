Postcondition: ***`dic` contains mappings from the first 26 characters of `layout1`, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `i` is 2. If the character `s[2]` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase value derived from `layout2[dic[s[2].lower()]]`. If `s[2]` is lowercase, `Mods` is updated by appending the value derived from `layout2[dic[s[2]]]`.***
