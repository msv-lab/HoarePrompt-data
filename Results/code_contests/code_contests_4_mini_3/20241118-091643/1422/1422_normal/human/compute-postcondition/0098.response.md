Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` exists in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `two[first]` is greater than or equal to `one[first][0] + c`, no changes are made to `ans` or `two[first]`. If `first` does not exist in `two` but exists in `one`, `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c`, and the same tuple as before is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not present in either `one` or `two`, no modifications to `ans` or `two` occur.***
