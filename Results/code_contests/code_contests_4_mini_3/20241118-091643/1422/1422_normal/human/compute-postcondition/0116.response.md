Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` equals `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `second` does not exist in `one` or if `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to the tuple `(b, i)`. Otherwise, if `second` exists in `one` and `one[second][0]` is greater than or equal to `b`, no modifications are made to `one[second]`. This encompasses all scenarios regarding the state of `one[second]` based on the specified conditions.***
