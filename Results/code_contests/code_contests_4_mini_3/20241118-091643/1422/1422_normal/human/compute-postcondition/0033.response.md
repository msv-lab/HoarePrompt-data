Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). If `third` is a key in `two`, the state of `two` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `third` is not a key in `two`, then the state of `two` and `ans` remains unchanged, and the state of `challengers` remains unchanged, while `i` remains 0.***
