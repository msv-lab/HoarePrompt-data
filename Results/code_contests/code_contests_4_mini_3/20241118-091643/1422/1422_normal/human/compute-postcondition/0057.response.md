The variable `second` is assigned two values: the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`. The previous values of `a` and `c` are not specified, but they are integers. Therefore, `second` will hold a tuple where the first element is `max(a, c)` and the second element is `min(a, c)`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `challengers`, and `first`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is n, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input, `challengers` has been updated to include the tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first` is a tuple with the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, and `second` is a tuple with the maximum and minimum of `a` and `c`.**
