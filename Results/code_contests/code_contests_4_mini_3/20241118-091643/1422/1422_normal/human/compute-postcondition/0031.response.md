Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `second` is an element of `one`. If `second` is found in `one`, then `two` is updated with the key `second` to the value `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. The state of `two`, `ans`, `challengers`, and `i` remains unchanged if `second` is not present in `one`.***
