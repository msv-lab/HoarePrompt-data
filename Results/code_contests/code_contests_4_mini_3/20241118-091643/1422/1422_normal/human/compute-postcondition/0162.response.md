Postcondition: ***`label` is 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` if this minimum is greater than the previous value of `cnt`. The variable `first` is set to `i`, where `i` is less than `n` and `n` is greater than 0. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, then `cnt`, `label`, and `first` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` take values from `challengers[i]`, and `ans` is not empty.***
