Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n`, `first` represents a tuple containing the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`. If `two[first]` is less than the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, max_a_b, min_a_b, one[first][1], n)`. If the condition is not met, `two[first]` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
