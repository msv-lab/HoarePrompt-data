The variable `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`. The values of `n`, `label`, and `cnt` are not affected by this assignment. However, since `ind1` is not defined in the initial state, its value is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the other variables and notes the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `label` is 2, `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)`, and `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`.**
