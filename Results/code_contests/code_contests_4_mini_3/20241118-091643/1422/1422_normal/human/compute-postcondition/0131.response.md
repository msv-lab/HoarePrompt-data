The value of `label` is assigned the constant value of 2. Since `label` was already set to 2, there is no change to its value. The other variables (`n`, `cnt`, `first`, `second`) remain unaffected as the code does not interact with them. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables without any change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `label` is 2, `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)` if `min(min(a, b), c)` is greater than `cnt`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2**
