The statement assigns the value `2` to the variable `label`. The value of `label` is changed, while the variables `n` and `ans` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ans` contains at least 2 tuples, and `label` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ans` contains at least 2 tuples, and `label` is 2**
