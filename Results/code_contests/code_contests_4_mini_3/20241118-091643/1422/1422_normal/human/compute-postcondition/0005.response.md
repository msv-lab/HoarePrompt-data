According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. To summarize, for the loop to be executed, `i` should start from 0 and will increment until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the loop).

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
