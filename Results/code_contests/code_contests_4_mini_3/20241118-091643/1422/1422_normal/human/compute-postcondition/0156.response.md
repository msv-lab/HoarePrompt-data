Postcondition: ***`label` is 1, `cnt` is the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is updated to `i`, and `cnt` is less than or equal to the previous value of `cnt` if the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the previous value of `cnt`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not greater than `cnt`, the values of `label`, `cnt`, and `first` remain unchanged. The variable `second` retains the respective indices, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is not empty, and `i` is incremented by 1, with `a`, `b`, and `c` assigned values from `challengers[i]`.***
