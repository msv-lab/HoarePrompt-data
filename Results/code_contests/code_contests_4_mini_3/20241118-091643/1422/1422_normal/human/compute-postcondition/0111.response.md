Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `third` exists in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` does not exist in `one`, no modifications are made to `two` or `ans`.***
