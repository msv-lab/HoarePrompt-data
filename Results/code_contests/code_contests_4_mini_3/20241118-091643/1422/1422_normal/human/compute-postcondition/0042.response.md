Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `third` is not a key in `two`. If `third` is an element of `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], 0). The state of `two`, `ans`, and `challengers` remains unchanged, and `i` remains 0. If `third` is not an element of `one`, then `two`, `ans`, and `challengers` remain unchanged, while `i` remains 0.***
