The variable `cnt` is assigned the minimum value among the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not given in the initial state. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `ans` contains at least 2 tuples, we cannot ascertain the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` directly from the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt` is assigned the minimum value of three unknown variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ans` contains at least 2 tuples, `label` is 2, and `cnt` is assigned the minimum of unknown values `a`, `b`, and `c`**.
