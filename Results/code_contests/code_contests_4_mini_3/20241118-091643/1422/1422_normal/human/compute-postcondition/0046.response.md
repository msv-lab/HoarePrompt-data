Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). If `first` is not a key in `one` or the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to `(c, i)`. If `first` is a key in `one` and its first element is greater than or equal to `c`, the state of `one` remains unchanged. The states of `two`, `ans`, `challengers`, and `i` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
