Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`, `two` is a dictionary with the key `first` now mapped to `one[first][0] + c`, `ans` is a list containing the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), `challengers` is a list containing the tuple (a, b, c), `i` is 0, `first` is assigned the values (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is assigned the values (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is assigned the values (max(b, c), min(b, c)), and `first` is a key in the dictionary `one`.**
