The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the list `challengers`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are derived from input, but their specific values are not mentioned in the initial state. The state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the list `challengers` has been modified by adding a new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to n + 1; `challengers` now includes the tuple (a, b, c)**
