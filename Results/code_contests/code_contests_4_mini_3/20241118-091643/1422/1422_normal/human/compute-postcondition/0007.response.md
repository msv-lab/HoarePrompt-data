The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the `challengers` list. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are taken from the input, which is split into integers. The other variables (`n`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `challengers` list with the new tuple added.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is a list containing the tuple (a, b, c), `i` is 0**
