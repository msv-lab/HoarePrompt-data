Postcondition: ***If `ans` is empty, then `label` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `first` and `second` are undefined. If `ans` is not empty and `n` is greater than 0, then `label` is 1, indicating that at least one tuple met the condition, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is updated to `i`, and `second` remains unchanged.***
