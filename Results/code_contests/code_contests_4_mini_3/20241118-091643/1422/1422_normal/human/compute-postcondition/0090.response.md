The variables `second` is assigned the values of `max(a, c)` and `min(a, c)`. The variables `first` has previously been defined as `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they will affect the outputs of `second`. The values of `n` and `i` do not affect `second`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to n + 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), and `second` is assigned the values (max(a, c), min(a, c)).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to n + 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is assigned the values (max(a, c), min(a, c))**
