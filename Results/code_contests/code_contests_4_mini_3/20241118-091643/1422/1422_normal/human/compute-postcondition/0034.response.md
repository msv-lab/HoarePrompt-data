Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). If `third` is a key in `two`, then `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`. The state of `two`, `ans`, `challengers` remains unchanged, and `i` remains 0. If `third` is not a key in `two`, then `two`, `ans`, `challengers`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
