The value of `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)`. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, so we cannot determine if it will change based on the comparison. The other variables `n`, `label`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `label` is 2, `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `label` is 2, `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)`**
