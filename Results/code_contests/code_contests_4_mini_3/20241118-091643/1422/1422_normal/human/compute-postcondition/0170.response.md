The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on a set of data that consists of a positive integer `n` and a series of integers `ai`, `bi`, and `ci` for each stone, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 10^9`. The specific output of the function is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a collection of stones based on their dimensions, but the exact return value is not specified. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes a collection of stones defined by their dimensions, but the specific return value is not stated.**
