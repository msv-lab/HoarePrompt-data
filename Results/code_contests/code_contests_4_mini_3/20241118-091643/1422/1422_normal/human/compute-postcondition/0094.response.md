Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), and `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `two[first]` is greater than or equal to `one[first][0] + c`, no changes are made to `ans` or `two[first]`.***
