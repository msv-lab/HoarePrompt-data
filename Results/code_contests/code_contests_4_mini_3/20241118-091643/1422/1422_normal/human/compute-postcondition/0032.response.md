Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). If `second` is a key in `two`, and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`, and `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b`. If `second` is a key in `two` but does not meet the condition, both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `second` is not a key in `two` but is a key in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is not in `one`, then no changes are made to `two` or `ans`, and the state of `challengers` remains unchanged, while `i` remains 0.***
