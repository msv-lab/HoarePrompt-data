Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `label` is set to 2 and `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)` if `min(min(a, b), c)` is greater than `cnt`. Additionally, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1` and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If `min(min(a, b), c)` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes are made to `label`, `cnt`, `first`, or `second`.***
