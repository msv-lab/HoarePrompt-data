Output State: **`label` is set to 2 if at least one tuple in `ans` contains values such that `min(min(a, b), c)` is greater than `cnt`, in which case `cnt` is the minimum of those values, and `first` and `second` are assigned the respective indices. If no tuple meets this condition, then `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged. If `ans` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `label` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `first` and `second` are undefined.**
