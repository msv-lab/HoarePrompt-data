According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`, which will be out of bounds for the loop defined by `range(n)`. Additionally, since `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer, it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only adjustments needed are for `i`, which should be set to `n + 1` to reflect that the loop would be attempting to execute again, even though it will not actually run.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to n + 1**
