Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `second` exists in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) is appended to `ans`. If `second` does not exist in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. This ensures that only valid updates happen based on the existence of `second` in `one`.***
