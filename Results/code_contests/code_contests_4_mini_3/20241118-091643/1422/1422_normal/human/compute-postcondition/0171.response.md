Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and then processes `n` sets of three integers (a, b, c) representing dimensions of challengers. It keeps track of certain pairs of challengers and their associated maximum values in two dictionaries. The function identifies which challenger has the minimum dimension among the processed sets and outputs either '1' followed by the index of the identified challenger or '2' followed by two indices based on specific conditions. If `n` is 0, it does not perform any processing and leaves its results undefined. The function does not accept any parameters. **
