Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`. If `first` is a key in `one`, then `two` is updated with `first` mapped to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` contains the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i). In the scenario where `first` is not a key in `one`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`. The state of `challengers` remains unchanged as a list containing the tuple (a, b, c), and `i` remains 0.***
