Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `i` is equal to `n`. If `first`, which represents the tuple containing the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, exists in `two` and its value is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, max(a, b), min(a, b), one[first][1], n)`. If `first` exists in `two` but the condition is not met, then no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. If `first` exists in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is updated to include `(one[first][0] + c, max(a, b), min(a, b), one[first][1], n)`. If `first` does not exist in either `one` or `two`, no updates are made to `two` or `ans`. Overall, the state of `two` and `ans` depends on the presence of `first` in the dictionaries and the evaluations of the specified conditions.***
