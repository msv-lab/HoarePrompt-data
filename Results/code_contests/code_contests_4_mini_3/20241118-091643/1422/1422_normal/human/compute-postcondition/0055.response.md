The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the list `challengers`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided as input. Since `challengers` is being modified by appending a new tuple, we need to note that the state of the `challengers` list will change, but the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is n, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input, and `challengers` has been updated to include the tuple `(a, b, c)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is n, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input, and `challengers` has been updated to include the tuple `(a, b, c)`**.
