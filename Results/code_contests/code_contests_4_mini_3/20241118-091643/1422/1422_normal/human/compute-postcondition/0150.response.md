Postcondition: ***`label` is 2 or 1. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is updated to 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which is less than its previous value, and `first` is assigned the value of `i`. In all cases, `n` remains greater than 0, `ans` is not empty, and `second` retains the respective indices. If the condition is not met, `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
