The variable `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, so we only know that `second` now holds the value of `ind2`. The values of `n`, `label`, `cnt`, and `first` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `label` is 2, `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `label` is 2, `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, `second` is assigned the value of `ind2**
