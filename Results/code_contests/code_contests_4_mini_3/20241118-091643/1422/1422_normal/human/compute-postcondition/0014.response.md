Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `one` is a dictionary containing at least the key `first` with a value that is a list where the first element is greater than or equal to `two[first] - c`, `two` is a dictionary containing the key `first`, `ans` is now a list containing the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), `challengers` is a list containing the tuple (a, b, c), `i` is 0, `first` is assigned the values (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is assigned the values (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is assigned the values (max(b, c), min(b, c)), and now `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c`.**
