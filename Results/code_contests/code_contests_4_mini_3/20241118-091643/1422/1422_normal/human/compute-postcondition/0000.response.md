The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(stdin.readline())`, which reads an integer input. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, but does not provide a specific value. Other variables (`ai`, `bi`, `ci`) representing the dimensions of the stones are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)**
