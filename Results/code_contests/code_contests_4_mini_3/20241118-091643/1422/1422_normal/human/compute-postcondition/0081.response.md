Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `i` is equal to `n`. If `third` exists in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` exists in `two` but is not less than `one[third][0] + c`, no changes are made. If `third` does not exist in `two` but exists in `one`, then `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` is updated with the tuple. If `third` does not exist in either `one` or `two`, no updates are made. Similarly, if `second` exists in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` exists in `two` but is not less than `one[second][0] + c`, no changes are made. If `second` does not exist in `two` but exists in `one`, then `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b` and `ans` is updated with the tuple. If `second` does not exist in either `one` or `two`, no updates are made. Finally, if `first` is not in `one` or if `one[first][0] < c`, then `one[first]` is set to `(c, i)`. The state of `two`, `ans`, and `one` is determined by the presence of `second`, `third`, and `first` and the evaluations of the specified conditions, ensuring all edge cases are covered.***
