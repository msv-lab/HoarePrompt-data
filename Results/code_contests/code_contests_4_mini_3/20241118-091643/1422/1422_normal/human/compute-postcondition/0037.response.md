Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). If `third` is a key in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not a key in `two`, or if `two[third]` is not less than `one[third][0] + c`, the states of `two`, `ans`, `challengers`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
