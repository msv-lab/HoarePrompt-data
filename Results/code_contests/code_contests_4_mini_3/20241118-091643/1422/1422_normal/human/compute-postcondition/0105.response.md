Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `second` exists in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is greater than or equal to `one[second][0] + b`, or if `second` does not exist in either `one` or `two`, then no modifications are made to `ans` or `two`. If `second` exists in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b`, and the same tuple is appended to `ans`, while if `second` does not exist in `one`, no changes occur. All edge cases regarding the presence of `second` in `one` and `two` are considered in these updates.***
