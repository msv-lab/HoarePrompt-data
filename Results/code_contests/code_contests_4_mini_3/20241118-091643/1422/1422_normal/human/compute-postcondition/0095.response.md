To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the provided initial state along with the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `i` is equal to `n + 1`
- `first` is `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`
- `second` is `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`
- `third` is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`

In the code snippet:
```
two[first] = one[first][0] + c
```

Here, the operation is:
- The value at the index `first` of the array or list `two` is assigned the result of `one[first][0] + c`.

Since we don't have specific values for `one`, `two`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and how `first` indexes into `one` and `two`, we cannot compute specific numeric results. However, we can state how the values are affected.

- The variable `two[first]` is updated to be equal to `one[first][0] + c`, assuming `one[first]` returns a list or array where the first element (`[0]`) is accessible.

Since there are no changes to the other variables `n`, `i`, `first`, `second`, or `third`, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to n + 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)), and two[first] is updated to one[first][0] + c.**
