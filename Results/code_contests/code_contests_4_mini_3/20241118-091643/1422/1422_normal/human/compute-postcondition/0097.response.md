Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to n + 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` exists in `one`, the value `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not present in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
