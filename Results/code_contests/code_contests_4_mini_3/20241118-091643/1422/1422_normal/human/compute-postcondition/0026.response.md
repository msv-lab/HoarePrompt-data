Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The state of `challengers` remains unchanged, `i` is 0. If `second` is a key in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) and `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b`. If `second` is not a key in `two`, both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
