Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `i` is equal to `n`. If `second` exists in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` does not exist in `one`, then no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
