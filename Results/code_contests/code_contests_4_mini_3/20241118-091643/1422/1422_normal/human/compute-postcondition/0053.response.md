According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state mentions that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), but does not specify the current value of `i`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to run again, we need to consider the current value of `i`. Since it is not specified, we will assume that `i` must be equal to `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we can set `i` to `n` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is n**
