Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `two[second]` is assigned the value `one[second][0] + b`; and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)**
