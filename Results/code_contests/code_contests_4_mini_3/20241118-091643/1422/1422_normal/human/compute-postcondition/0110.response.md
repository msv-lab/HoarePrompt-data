In the provided code snippet, `ans.append(...)` is executed, which appends a tuple to the list `ans`. The tuple consists of five elements:

1. `one[third][0] + a`: This adds the first element of `one[third]` to `a`.
2. `third[0]`: This is the first element of the tuple `third`, which is `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`.
3. `third[1]`: This is the second element of the tuple `third`, which is also part of `third`.
4. `one[third][1]`: This accesses the second element of `one[third]`.
5. `i`: This is equal to `n + 1`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `i` will be at least 2 (since `n` starts from 1). The exact values of `one`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific numeric results for the first element of the tuple.

Therefore, the output state will mention the nature of the variables involved:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to n + 1, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)), and `ans` is updated with a new tuple containing (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)**
