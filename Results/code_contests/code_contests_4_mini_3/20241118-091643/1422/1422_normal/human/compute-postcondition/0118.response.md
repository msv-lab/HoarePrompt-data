Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` equals `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `third` does not exist in `one` or if `one[third][0]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is updated to the tuple `(a, i)`. Otherwise, if `third` exists in `one` and `one[third][0]` is greater than or equal to `a`, no modifications are made to `one[third]`. This ensures that `one[third]` reflects the most relevant values based on the conditions provided.***
