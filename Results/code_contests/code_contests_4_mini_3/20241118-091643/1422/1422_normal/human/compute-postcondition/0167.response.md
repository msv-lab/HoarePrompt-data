Postcondition: ***`ans` is empty, then `label` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `first` and `second` are undefined. If `ans` is not empty and `n` is greater than 0, then `label` is either 2 or remains unchanged, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged, and no tuple meets the condition. The loop may have executed up to `n` times, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from `challengers[i]` during each iteration.***
