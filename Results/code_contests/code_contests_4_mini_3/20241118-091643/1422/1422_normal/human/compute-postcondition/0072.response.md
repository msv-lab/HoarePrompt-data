Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `i` is equal to `n`. If `second` exists in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + c`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. If `second` does not exist in `two` but exists in `one`, `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is updated to include `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` does not exist in either `one` or `two`, no updates are made to `two` or `ans`. Overall, the state of `two` and `ans` is determined by the presence of `second` in the dictionaries and the evaluations of the specified conditions.***
