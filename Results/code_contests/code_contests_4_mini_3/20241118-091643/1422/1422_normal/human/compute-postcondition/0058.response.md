The values of `third` are assigned the maximum and minimum of the values `b` and `c`. The previous values of `b` and `c` are not specified, but they are integers. Therefore, `third` will be a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values of `b` and `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is n, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input, `challengers` has been updated to include the tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first` is a tuple with the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` is a tuple with the maximum and minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is a tuple with the maximum and minimum of `b` and `c`.**
