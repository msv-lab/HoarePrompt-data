Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` equals `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` does not exist in `one` or if `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to the tuple `(c, i)`. If `first` exists in `one` and `one[first][0]` is greater than or equal to `c`, no modifications are made to `one[first]`. This logic encompasses all scenarios regarding the state of `one[first]` based on the conditions specified.***
