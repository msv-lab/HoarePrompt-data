The `ans` list is updated by appending a tuple containing the calculated values based on the current state. Specifically, the tuple consists of: 

1. The value `one[third][0] + a`, which is derived from the element `third` found in `one`.
2. The first element of `third`, denoted as `third[0]`.
3. The second element of `third`, denoted as `third[1]`.
4. The second element of `one[third]`, denoted as `one[third][1]`.
5. The current value of `i`, which is 0.

Since `ans` is updated with this new tuple, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `third` is an element of `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, `i` is 0, `three` is not a key in `two`, `two`, `ans` is updated with the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], 0), and `challengers` remains unchanged.**
