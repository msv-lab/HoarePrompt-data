Postcondition: ***If `label` is 1, the output will be '1' followed by the value of `first + 1`, where `first` may be undefined. If `label` is not 1 (i.e., it is 0 or 2), the output will be '2' followed by the values of `first + 1` and `second + 1`, where both `first` and `second` may still be undefined. In any case, if `ans` is empty, the execution doesn't change the values of `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` from their initial states. Additionally, if `label` was set to 2, it indicates that no tuples met the condition during the loop execution.
