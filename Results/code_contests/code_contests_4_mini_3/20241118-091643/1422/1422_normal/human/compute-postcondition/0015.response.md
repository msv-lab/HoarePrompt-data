Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `one` is a dictionary containing at least the key `first` with a value that is a list where the first element is greater than or equal to `two[first] - c`, `two` is a dictionary containing the key `first`, and if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is now a list containing the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), and `two[first]` is updated to the value of `one[first][0] + c`. In the case that the condition is not satisfied, `ans` remains unchanged and `two[first]` retains its previous value.***
