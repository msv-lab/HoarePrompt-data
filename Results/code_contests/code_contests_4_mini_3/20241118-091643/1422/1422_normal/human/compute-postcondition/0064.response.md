Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n`, and `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input. If the tuple `first` (which is (max(a, b), min(a, b))) exists in the dictionary `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, and the list `ans` includes the new tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
