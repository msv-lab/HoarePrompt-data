Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `first` is defined as (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, then no modifications are made to `ans` or `two`. This accounts for all cases regarding the relationship between `two[third]` and `one[third][0] + c`, ensuring that both the presence and absence of updates to `ans` and `two` are considered.***
