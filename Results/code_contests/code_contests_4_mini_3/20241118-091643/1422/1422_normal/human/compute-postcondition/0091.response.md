The variable `third` is assigned two values: `max(b, c)` and `min(b, c)`. The values of `b` and `c` are not provided in the initial state, but we know they are used to calculate the maximum and minimum. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `first`, `second`) remain unaffected during this operation.

The output state will include the details of the new variable `third`, which holds the results of the calculations based on `b` and `c`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is equal to n + 1, `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c))**
