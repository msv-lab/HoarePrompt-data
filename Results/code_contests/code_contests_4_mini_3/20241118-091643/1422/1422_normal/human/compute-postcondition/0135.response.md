Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. Otherwise, the values of `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
