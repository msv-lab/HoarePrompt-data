Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `first` is the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`; if `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. Otherwise, if `first` is in `one`, `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c` and `ans` is updated with the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not in either `two` or `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
