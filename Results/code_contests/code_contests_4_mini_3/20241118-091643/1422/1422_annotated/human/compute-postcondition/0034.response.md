Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` and `two` are dictionaries; `ans` is a list; `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`; `third` is in `two`; the value of `two[third]` is less than the sum of `one[third][0]` and `c`, and the relationships between the values in `one`, `two`, and the variables `b` and `c` are preserved.***
