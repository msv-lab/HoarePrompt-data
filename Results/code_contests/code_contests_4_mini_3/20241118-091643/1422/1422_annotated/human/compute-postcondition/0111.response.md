Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`. If `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. This covers all potential states of `two` and `ans` based on the presence of `third` in `one`, ensuring that updates occur only under the defined conditions.***
