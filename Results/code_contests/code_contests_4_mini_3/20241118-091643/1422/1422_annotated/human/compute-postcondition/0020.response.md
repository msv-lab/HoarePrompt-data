Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` is an empty dictionary; `two` is a dictionary that does not contain the value of `first`; `ans` is an empty list; `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`; `i` is 0; `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`; `third` is assigned the values (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, and `ans` is updated with the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not in `one`, there is no change to the dictionaries or the list.***
