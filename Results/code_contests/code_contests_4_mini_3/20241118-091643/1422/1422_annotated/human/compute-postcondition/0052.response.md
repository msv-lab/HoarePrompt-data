Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. If `third` is not a key in `one` or if `one[third][0]` is less than `a`, then `third` becomes a key in `one` with the value `(a, i)`, while `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `third` is already a key in `one` and `one[third][0]` is greater than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `one`, `two`, or `ans`.***
