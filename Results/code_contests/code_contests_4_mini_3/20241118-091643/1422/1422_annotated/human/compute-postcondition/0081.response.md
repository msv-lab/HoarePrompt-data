Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are extracted values. If `first` is not a key in `one` or the value of `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to `(c, i)`. If `first` is a key in `one` and the value of `one[first][0]` is greater than or equal to `c`, no changes are made to `one`. The integrity of the data structures `one`, `two`, and `ans` is preserved throughout the operations, ensuring that updates occur only under the specified conditions, and no other changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
