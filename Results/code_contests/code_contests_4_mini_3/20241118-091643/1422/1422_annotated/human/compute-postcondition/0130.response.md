According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ans` list. Since `ans` is a list containing at least 1 tuple at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute one more time, provided there is still at least one tuple left in `ans`.

At the end of the last iteration, the program has processed the first tuple from `ans`, and `ans` must now contain at least one more tuple for the loop to continue. Thus, the size of `ans` should be adjusted accordingly.

The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, and `ind2` are derived from the next tuple in `ans`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the contents of `ans`, and we need to assume that `a`, `b`, and `c`, as well as `ind1` and `ind2`, will take values from the next tuple in `ans`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `ans` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `cnt` is a positive integer, (a, b, c, ind1, ind2) is the next tuple in `ans`**
