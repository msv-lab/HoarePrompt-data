Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `challengers` includes the tuple `(a, b, c)`; `first` is the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`. If `first` is found in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is updated to include a new tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not in `one`, no changes are made.***
