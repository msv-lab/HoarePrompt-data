Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are values obtained from input; `first` is assigned as (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is assigned as (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is assigned as (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `second` is a key in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and the tuple (`one[second][0] + b`, `second[0]`, `second[1]`, `one[second][1]`, `i`) is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not a key in `one`, then `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. The integrity of the structures `two` and `ans` is preserved based on the conditions checked.***
