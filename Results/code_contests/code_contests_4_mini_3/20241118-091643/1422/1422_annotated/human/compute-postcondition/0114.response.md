Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `third` is either in `two` or `one`. If `first` is not in `one` or if `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to the tuple `(c, i)`. If `first` is in `one` and `one[first][0]` is greater than or equal to `c`, no changes are made to `one`. The state of the variables `two` and `ans` remains unchanged based on the conditions established in the precondition.***
