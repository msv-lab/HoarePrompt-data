To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided:

1. The variable `ans` is a list that is being appended to.
2. The code `one[third][0] + a` suggests that we are accessing the `third` index of `one`, which is a collection (most likely a list or tuple), then accessing the first element of that collection, and adding `a` to it.
3. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. 
4. `third[0]` and `third[1]` are accessing the first and second elements of the `third` variable, which is likely a tuple or list.
5. The existing variables `one` and `third` are not defined in the initial state, but we assume they hold appropriate values based on their usage.

Considering the statement appends a tuple to `ans`, we summarize the changes:

- The tuple consists of five elements: 
  - The sum of `one[third][0]` and `a`
  - The two elements of `third`
  - The second element of `one[third]`
  - The value of `i`, which is equal to `n`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `one`, and `third` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output values but can describe the structure of the resulting output.

Output State: **`ans` is updated with a tuple containing the sum of `one[third][0] + a`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, `i` (equal to n)**
