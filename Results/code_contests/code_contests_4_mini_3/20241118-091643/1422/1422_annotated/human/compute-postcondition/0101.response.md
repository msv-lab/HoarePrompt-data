Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `first` is the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` and `two[second]` is assigned the value `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. The state of `two` and `ans` reflects the updates based on the comparison of `two[second]` and `one[second][0] + b`.***
