Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` and `two` are dictionaries, `ans` is a list, and `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, then a tuple containing `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[second]` is updated to the value of `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is greater than or equal to `one[second][0] + c`, no changes are made to `ans` or `two`. Additionally, it should be noted that the values of `one[second][0]`, `b`, and `c` must be such that `two[second]` can potentially be updated depending on their relationship.***
