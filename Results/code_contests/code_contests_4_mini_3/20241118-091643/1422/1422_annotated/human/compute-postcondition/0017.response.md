Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` is a dictionary that contains the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary that does not contain the value of `first`; `ans` is an empty list; `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`; `i` is 0; `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`; `third` is assigned the values (max(b, c), min(b, c)).***
