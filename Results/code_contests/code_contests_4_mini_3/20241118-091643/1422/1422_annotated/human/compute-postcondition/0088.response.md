The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the list `challengers`. The variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly affected by this operation, but `challengers` will now include the new tuple. Since `challengers` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the updated state of `challengers`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are extracted values from input; `challengers` now includes the tuple `(a, b, c)`**
