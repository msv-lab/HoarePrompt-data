Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `first` is the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`. If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + a`, `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is assigned the value `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is not less than `one[third][0] + a`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. The program handles all scenarios based on the comparison of `two[third]` and `one[third][0] + a`, ensuring appropriate updates or no changes are applied accordingly.***
