The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the tuple located at index `i` in the list `challengers`. Given that `i` is 1, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will correspond to the elements of the second tuple in the `challengers` list. The state of `n` and `ans` is unchanged, assuming `challengers` has at least two tuples. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a non-empty list of tuples; `i` is 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from the second tuple in `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a non-empty list of tuples; `i` is 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from the second tuple in `ans`.**
