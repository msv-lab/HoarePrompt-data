The code appends a tuple to the list `ans`. The tuple consists of the value `one[third][0] + a`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i`. The previous values of the affected variables are `a`, `third`, `one`, and `i`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 10^5, `i` is equal to `n`, and the specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and the contents of `one` and `third` are obtained from input but not specified here, the output state will include the values being appended to `ans`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are values obtained from input; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing values; `ans` is updated with a new tuple that includes `one[third][0] + a`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are values obtained from input; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing values; `ans` is updated with a new tuple that includes `one[third][0] + a`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i`.**
