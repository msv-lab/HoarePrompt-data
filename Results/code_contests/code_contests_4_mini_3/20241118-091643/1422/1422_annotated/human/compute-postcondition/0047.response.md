Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; the dictionaries `one` and `two`, as well as the list `ans`, maintain their relationships and values according to the precondition. If `second` is not in `one`, or if `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, then `one` may have a key `second` with a value that is not specified; otherwise, no changes are made to `one`, `two`, or `ans`.***
