Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` and `two` are dictionaries; `ans` is a list; `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`; and `third` is not a key in `two`. If `third` is a key in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i). If `third` is not a key in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. The values and relationships between the elements in `one`, `two`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
