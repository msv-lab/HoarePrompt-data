Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. If `second` is not a key in `one` or if `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, then `one` contains the key `second` with the value `(b, i)`, while `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `second` is already in `one` and `one[second][0]` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to `one`, `two`, or `ans`.***
