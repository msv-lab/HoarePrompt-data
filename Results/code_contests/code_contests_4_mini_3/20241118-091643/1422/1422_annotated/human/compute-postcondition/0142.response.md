According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ans`. The loop iterates over each tuple in `ans`, so for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one additional tuple available in `ans` that has not yet been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` contains at least 3 tuples. To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `ans` has at least 4 tuples. Since the loop is iterating through each tuple, if `cnt` is a positive integer and the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is being compared to `cnt`, we also need to update the index of the tuple being processed.

If we assume that the loop has already processed the first 3 tuples, we should adjust the state to reflect that the loop is now going to process the 4th tuple. Hence, we can state that `ans` must have at least 4 tuples and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` should be set to the values of the 4th tuple in `ans`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a list containing at least 4 tuples; `cnt` is a positive integer; (a, b, c, ind1, ind2) are the values of the 4th tuple in the list `ans`.**
