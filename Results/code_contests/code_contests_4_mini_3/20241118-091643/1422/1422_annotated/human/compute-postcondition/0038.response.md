Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` and `two` are dictionaries; `ans` is a list; `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`. The variable `third` is not a key in `two`. The values and relationships between the elements in `one`, `two`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
