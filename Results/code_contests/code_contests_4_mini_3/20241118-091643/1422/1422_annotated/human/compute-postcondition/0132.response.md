The `cnt` is assigned the value of `min(min(a, b), c)`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are taken from the current tuple (a, b, c, ind1, ind2) in the list `ans`. The specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, but `cnt` will be the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a list containing at least 2 tuples; `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`; `label` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a list containing at least 2 tuples; `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`; `label` is 2**
