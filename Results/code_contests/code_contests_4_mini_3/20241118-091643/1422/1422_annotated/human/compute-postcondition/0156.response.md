Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a non-empty list of tuples; `i` is 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from the second tuple in `ans`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is set to 1. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes are made to `label`, `cnt`, or `first`.***
