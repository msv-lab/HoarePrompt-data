According to the code, the loop will execute again if the value of `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and it is necessary that `n` is greater than 1. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, and it can be any value from 1 to 100,000, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to continue. The `ans`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `label`, and `cnt` do not need to be adjusted, as they are not directly affecting the loop condition in terms of values that need to be updated for the next iteration.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment for the states is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ans` is a non-empty list of tuples, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from the second tuple in `ans`**
