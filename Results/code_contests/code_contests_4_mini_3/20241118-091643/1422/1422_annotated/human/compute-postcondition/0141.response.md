Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a list containing at least 3 tuples; `cnt` is a positive integer. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to this minimum value, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes are made to `label`, `cnt`, `first`, or `second`.***
