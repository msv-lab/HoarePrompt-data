Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` equals `n`; `third` is either in `two` or `one`. If `third` is not in `one` or if `one[third][0]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is updated to the tuple `(a, i)`; otherwise, no changes are made to `one`. The variables `two`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged regardless of whether the update occurs or not.***
