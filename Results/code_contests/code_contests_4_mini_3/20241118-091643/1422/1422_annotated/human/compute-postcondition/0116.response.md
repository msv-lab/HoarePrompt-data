Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `third` is either in `two` or `one`; if `second` is not in `one` or `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to the tuple `(b, i)` while the state of the variables `two` and `ans` remains unchanged. If `second` is in `one` and `one[second][0]` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to `one`.***
