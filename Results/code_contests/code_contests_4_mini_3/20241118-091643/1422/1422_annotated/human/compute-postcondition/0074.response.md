Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are values obtained from input; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the maximum and minimum values from pairs of `a`, `b`, and `c`; `two[third]` is updated with the value of `one[third][0] + a`.**
