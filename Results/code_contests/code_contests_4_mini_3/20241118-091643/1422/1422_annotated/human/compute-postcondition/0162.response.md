Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is a non-empty list of tuples, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from the third tuple in `ans`, if the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is set to 2. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes occur to `label`, `cnt`, or `first`.***
