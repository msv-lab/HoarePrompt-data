The variable `label` is assigned the value 1. This assignment does not affect the values of any previously defined variables. The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variable `label`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `ans` is a non-empty list of tuples, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values from the first tuple in `ans`, the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, and `label` is 1.**
