Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one`, `two` are dictionaries; `ans` is a list; `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`; `i` is 0; `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`; `third` is assigned the values (max(b, c), min(b, c)); and `first` is a key in the dictionary `two`. If the value of `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a new tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to the list `ans`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `ans` or `two[first]`.***
