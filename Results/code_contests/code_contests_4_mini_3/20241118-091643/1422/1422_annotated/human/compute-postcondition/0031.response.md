Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` and `two` are dictionaries; `ans` is a list. If `second` is a key in `one`, the dictionary `two` is updated with `second` as the key and the value is the sum of `one[second][0]` and `b`. Additionally, the list `ans` is appended with a tuple containing `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is not a key in `one`, there are no changes made to `ans`, `one`, or `two`.***
