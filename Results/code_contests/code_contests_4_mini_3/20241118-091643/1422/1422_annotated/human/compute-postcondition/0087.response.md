The code assigns values to `a`, `b`, and `c` by reading a line of input, splitting it into components, and converting each component into an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will depend on the input provided through `stdin`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `i`, while `a`, `b`, and `c` take on the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are extracted values from input.**
