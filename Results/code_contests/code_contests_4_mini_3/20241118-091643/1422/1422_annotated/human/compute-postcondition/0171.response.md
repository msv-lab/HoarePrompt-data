Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, reads `n` triples of positive integers (a, b, c), and processes these to determine a result. It maintains two dictionaries to track maximum values associated with pairs of the input integers. Based on comparisons of these values, the function generates a list of results that could lead to either a single output indicating one unique configuration, or a dual output indicating two configurations. The function outputs '1' along with the index of the configuration or '2' along with two indices based on the minimum values processed. There is no error handling for invalid input or scenarios where the input data is insufficient. **
