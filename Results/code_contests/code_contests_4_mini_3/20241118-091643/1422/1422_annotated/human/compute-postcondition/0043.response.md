Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` and `two` are dictionaries; `ans` is a list. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, no changes are made to `ans` or `two[third]`. If `third` is not in `two` but is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not in either `one` or `two`, no changes are made to `ans`, `one`, or `two`. The relationships among `one`, `two`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain preserved throughout.***
