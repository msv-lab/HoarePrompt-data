Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` and `two` are dictionaries; `ans` is a list; `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`; `i` is 0; `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`; `third` is assigned the values (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` is a key in `two`, and if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then a new tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is a key in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is updated with the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not in either `one` or `two`, there are no changes made to `ans` or the dictionaries.***
