The variable `label` is assigned the value `2`. This does not affect any existing variables such as `n`, `ans`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state reflects the new assignment of `label`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a list containing at least 3 tuples; `cnt` is a positive integer; `label` is 2**
