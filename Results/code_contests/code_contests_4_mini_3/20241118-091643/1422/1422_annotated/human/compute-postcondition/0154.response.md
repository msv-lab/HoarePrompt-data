The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of the minimum of the values `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the second tuple in the list `ans`, but the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, without knowing the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt`. 

However, we can still express the output state based on the information given. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a non-empty list of tuples; `i` is 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from the second tuple in `ans`; `label` is 1; `cnt` is the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
