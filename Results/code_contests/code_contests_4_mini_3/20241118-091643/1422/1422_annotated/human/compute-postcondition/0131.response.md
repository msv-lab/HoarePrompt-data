The variable `label` is assigned the value `2`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`n`, `ans`, or `cnt`) in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `label`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `ans` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `cnt` is a positive integer, (a, b, c, ind1, ind2) is the next tuple in `ans`, `label` is 2**
