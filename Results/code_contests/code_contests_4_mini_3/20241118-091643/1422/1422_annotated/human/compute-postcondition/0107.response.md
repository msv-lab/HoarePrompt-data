In the given code snippet, `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`. The variables affected by this assignment are `two`, `one`, and `a`. The exact previous values of `one[third][0]` and `a` are not provided, but we know that `one[third][0]` is an element of the `one` list (or tuple) at index `third`, and `a` is some integer value.

Therefore, the new value of `two[third]` will depend on the values of `one[third][0]` and `a`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Since we cannot ascertain specific values for `one[third][0]` and `a`, we will indicate the required assignment in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `first` is the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`; `ans` has a new tuple appended: `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`; `two[third]` is assigned the value `one[third][0] + a`.**
