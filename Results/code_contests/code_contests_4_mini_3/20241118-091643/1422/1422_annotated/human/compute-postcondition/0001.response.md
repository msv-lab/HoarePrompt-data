The code initializes a dictionary called `one`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the dictionary creation does not affect it. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, and `one` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, and `one` is an empty dictionary**.
