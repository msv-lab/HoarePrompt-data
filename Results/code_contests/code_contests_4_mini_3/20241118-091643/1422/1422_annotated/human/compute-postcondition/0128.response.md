The value of `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. The other variables `n`, `ans`, `label`, `cnt`, `one`, `two`, and `first` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `ans` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `label` is 2, `cnt` is now min(a, b, c), `one` is a dictionary, `two` is a dictionary, the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the previous value of `cnt`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `ans` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `label` is 2, `cnt` is now min(a, b, c), `one` is a dictionary, `two` is a dictionary, the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the previous value of `cnt`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, `second` is assigned the value of `ind2**.
