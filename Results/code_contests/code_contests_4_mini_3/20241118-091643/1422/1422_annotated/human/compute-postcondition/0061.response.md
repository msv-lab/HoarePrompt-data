Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are values obtained from input; `first` is assigned as (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is assigned as (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is assigned as (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `two[first]` is greater than or equal to `one[first][0] + c`, no changes are made to `ans` or `two[first]`.***
