To provide the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet provided in relation to the initial state.

1. The code `cnt = min(min(a, b), c)` computes the minimum value among three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. The initial state indicates that `cnt` is a positive integer, but we do not know the specific values of `a`, `b`, or `c`.
3. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt` after the assignment.

Given that we can't ascertain the exact numerical values for `cnt` or its new value based on unknown `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the known variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a list containing at least 3 tuples; `cnt` is a positive integer; `label` is 2; `cnt` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` which are unknown.**
