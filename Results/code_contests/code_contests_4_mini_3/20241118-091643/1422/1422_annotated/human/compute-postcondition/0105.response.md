Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `first` is the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`. If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` and `two[second]` is assigned the value `one[second][0] + b`. If `second` is in `two` but `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. If `second` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is neither in `two` nor in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. Thus, the program accounts for all potential states of `two` and `ans` based on the presence of `second` in `two` or `one`, ensuring that appropriate updates occur only under the defined conditions.***
