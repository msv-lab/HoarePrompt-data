Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a list containing tuples of (a, b, c, ind1, ind2). If `ans` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged. If `ans` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute once for each tuple. After execution, if the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` (for the last tuple processed) is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to this minimum value, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, the values of `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.**
