Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are values obtained from input; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the maximum and minimum values from pairs of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `third` is a key in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not a key in `one`, both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. This ensures that the integrity of the structures `two` and `ans` is preserved based on the conditions checked.***
