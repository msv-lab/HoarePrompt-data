The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its signature. However, it operates on some external input, which is implied in the context. Given the constraints, we assume that it processes a positive integer `n` and a series of edge lengths represented by the parameters `ai`, `bi`, and `ci` for each stone.

Since the output has not been specified in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function. 

However, based on the constraints provided, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a set of positive integer edge lengths (ai, bi, ci for i-th stone where 1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 10^9), to produce a result based on these inputs.**
