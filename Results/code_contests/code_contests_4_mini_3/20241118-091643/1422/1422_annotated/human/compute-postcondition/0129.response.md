Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `ans` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, and `cnt` is a positive integer. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, while `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, the values of `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
