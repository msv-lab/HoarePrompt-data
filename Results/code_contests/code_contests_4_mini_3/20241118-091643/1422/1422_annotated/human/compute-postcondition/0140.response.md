The value of `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`, which is unknown. The other variables (`n`, `ans`, `cnt`, `label`, and `first`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the unaffected variables and the assignment of the unknown variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is a list containing at least 3 tuples; `cnt` is a positive integer; `label` is 2; `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, which is unknown; `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`, which is unknown.**
