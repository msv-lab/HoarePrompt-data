Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are extracted values. If `second` is not a key in `one` or if the value of `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to `(b, i)`. If `second` is a key in `one` and the value of `one[second][0]` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to `one`. The integrity of the data structures `one`, `two`, and `ans` is preserved, ensuring that updates occur only under the specified conditions, and no other changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
