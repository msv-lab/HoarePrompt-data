Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `first` is the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. Additionally, if `first` is not in either `two` or `one`, all previous states of `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. The program handles edge cases where `second` may equal the boundaries of `one` and ensures no modifications occur if `second` is absent from `one`.***
