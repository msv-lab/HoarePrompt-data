Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are values obtained from input; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the maximum and minimum values from pairs of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is greater than or equal to `one[second][0] + b`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. If `second` is not in `two`, no modifications are made to `two` or `ans`. The integrity of the structures `two` and `ans` is preserved based on the conditions checked.***
