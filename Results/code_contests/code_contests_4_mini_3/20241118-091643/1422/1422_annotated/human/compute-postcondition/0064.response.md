Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned based on the input from stdin; `first` is assigned as (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is assigned as (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is assigned as (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` is a key in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple (`one[first][0] + c`, `first[0]`, `first[1]`, `one[first][1]`, `i`). If `first` is not in `one`, the program does not modify `two` or `ans`.***
