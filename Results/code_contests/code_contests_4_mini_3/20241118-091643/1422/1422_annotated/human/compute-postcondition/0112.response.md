Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `third` is either in `two` or `one`. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + a`, then `ans` is updated by appending the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is assigned the value `one[third][0] + a`. If `third` is in `two` but `two[third]` is not less than `one[third][0] + a`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. If `third` is in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is neither in `two` nor in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. This ensures that all potential states of `two` and `ans` are appropriately handled based on the presence of `third` in either collection, resulting in the correct updates or no changes as defined by the conditions.***
