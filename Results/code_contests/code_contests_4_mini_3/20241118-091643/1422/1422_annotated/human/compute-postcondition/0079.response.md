Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are extracted values. If `third` is a key in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a`. If `third` is in `two` but does not satisfy the first condition, or if `third` is not a key in `two`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`. If `third` is not in `two` but exists in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not a key in `one`, both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. The integrity of the data structures `two` and `ans` is preserved throughout the operations, ensuring that all updates are only made under the specified conditions.***
