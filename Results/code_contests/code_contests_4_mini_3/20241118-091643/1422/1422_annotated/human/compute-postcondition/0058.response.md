The variable `third` is assigned the value of a tuple `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`. The values of `b` and `c` are determined from the input. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `first`, and `second`) are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state will reflect the computed values for `third` based on the maximum and minimum of `b` and `c`, while retaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned based on the input from stdin; `first` is assigned as (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is assigned as (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is assigned as (max(b, c), min(b, c))**
