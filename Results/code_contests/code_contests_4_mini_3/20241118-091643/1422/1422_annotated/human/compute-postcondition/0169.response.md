Postcondition: ***If `ans` is a non-empty list of tuples and `label` is equal to 1, then `cnt` is the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the last tuple processed which is greater than the previous value of `cnt`, `first` is updated to the index of the last tuple processed, and the output is '1' followed by `first + 1`. If `label` is not equal to 1, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged, and the output is '2' followed by `first + 1` and `second + 1`. If `ans` is empty, no output is generated. Additionally, the case where the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` for any tuple is less than or equal to `cnt` results in the outputs corresponding to the second part, with no updates to `label`, `cnt`, `first`, or `second`.***
