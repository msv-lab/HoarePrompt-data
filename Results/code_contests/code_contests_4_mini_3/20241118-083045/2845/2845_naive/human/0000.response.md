To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

### Problem description:
The task is to calculate the expected value of the number of unique elements in a segment of the array defined by two randomly selected indices `l` and `r`. If `l > r`, they are swapped, and both indices are inclusive. 

The expected value must be calculated over all possible pairs of indices `(l, r)`.

### Program:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
arr = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
req = len(set(arr))
print(req + 1) / 2
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array using `len(set(arr))` and assigns it to `req`.
   - It then calculates `(req + 1) / 2` and prints that value, which does not represent the expected value of unique elements in all segments defined by `l` and `r`.

2. **Reasoning About the Logic**:
   - The expected number is not simply `(number of unique elements + 1) / 2`. The expected number of unique elements depends on the distribution of elements throughout the array and how many unique elements exist in each possible segment, not just the total unique count.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     1 1 2
     ```
   - The unique elements in the entire array are `{1, 2}`, giving `req = 2`.
   - However, the expected unique count for segments is not `(2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5`. The segments and their unique counts are:
     - (1, 1): {1} → 1 unique
     - (1, 2): {1} → 1 unique
     - (1, 3): {1, 2} → 2 unique
     - (2, 2): {1} → 1 unique
     - (2, 3): {1, 2} → 2 unique
     - (3, 3): {2} → 1 unique
   - Total unique counts: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8, and the average (expected value) over 6 segments is `8 / 6 ≈ 1.3333`, which is not equal to `1.5`.

### Conclusion:
The program fundamentally miscalculates the expected count of unique values as it does not consider the specific segments but rather the total unique count. Thus, the output will not match the expected results for various cases, which shows that the logic is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
