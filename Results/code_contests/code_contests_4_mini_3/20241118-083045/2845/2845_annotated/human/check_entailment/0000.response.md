To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Description Recap
The task requires calculating the expected value of the number of unique elements in a segment of the array from index `l` to index `r`, where `l` and `r` are chosen randomly. The important points include:
1. If `l > r`, they should be swapped.
2. The output should be the expected number of unique elements from all possible segments defined by `l` and `r`.

### Provided Code
```python
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    req = len(set(arr))
    print(req + 1) / 2
```

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The first line reads the size of the array `n`.
   - The second line reads the array elements.

2. **Logic for Unique Elements:**
   - The code calculates the number of unique elements in the array using `len(set(arr))`.
   - It then computes `(req + 1) / 2`, where `req` is the number of unique elements.

### Issues with the Code
The main issue with the provided code is that it does not calculate the expected number of unique elements in all possible segments `[l, r]`. It merely computes half of the number of unique elements, which does not reflect the expected value considering all combinations of `l` and `r`.

#### Potential Case
Consider the following case:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  1 2 3
  ```
- Expected Calculation:
  - Possible segments: `[1,1]`, `[1,2]`, `[1,3]`, `[2,2]`, `[2,3]`, `[3,3]`
  - Unique elements: `1`, `1,2`, `1,2,3`, `2`, `2,3`, `3`
  - Expected unique elements = (1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 1.666667 (approximately)

The code incorrectly outputs:
```
3 + 1 / 2 = 2.0
```
This is not the correct expected value.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly follow the problem description and doesn't calculate the expected number of unique elements in all segments accurately, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
