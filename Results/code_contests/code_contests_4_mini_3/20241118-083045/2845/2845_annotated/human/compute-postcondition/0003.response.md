The expression `print(req + 1) / 2` attempts to execute a print function and a division operation at the same time, which is not valid in Python. However, focusing on the impact of `req`:

- `req` is the count of unique integers in `arr`.
- The value of `req + 1` is calculated.
- The result of `(req + 1) / 2` is not printed but rather, it indicates an operation that may return a value.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `req` is still defined as the count of unique integers in `arr`, and there's an operation involving it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `req` is the count of unique integers in `arr, and the operation (req + 1) / 2 is performed.**
