The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by the definition. However, it operates on a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a list `arr` of `n` positive integers (where each integer ai in arr satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6). 

The output of the function is not specified but would typically involve processing the input values according to some logic. Without specific output cases being defined, we cannot detail return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on a positive integer n and a list arr of n positive integers. The specifics of the return value are not provided.**
