Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from user input, then reads a list of `n` integers. It calculates the number of unique integers in the list, adds 1 to this count, divides the result by 2, and prints the final value. There are no parameters accepted directly by the function, and it handles user input for the values. However, it does not include error handling for invalid inputs or edge cases such as when `n` is 0 or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
