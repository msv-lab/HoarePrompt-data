`arr` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`, which means it will take an input from the user, split that input by spaces, convert each split string into an integer, and return an iterable of integers. However, since `arr` is defined as a list of `n` positive integers, the output state will reflect that `arr` now contains those `n` integers but does not specify what they are until input is provided. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of n integers derived from user input**
