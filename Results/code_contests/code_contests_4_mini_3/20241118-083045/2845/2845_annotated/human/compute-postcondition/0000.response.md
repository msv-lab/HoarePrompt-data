The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, the output state will reflect that `n` is now an input integer. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of n positive integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6**
