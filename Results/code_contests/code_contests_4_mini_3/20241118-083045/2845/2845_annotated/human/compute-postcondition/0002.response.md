The variable `req` is assigned the value of `len(set(arr))`, which calculates the number of unique integers in the list `arr`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is derived from user input, thus it contains `n` integers. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, and `req` is the count of unique integers in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, and `req` is the count of unique integers in `arr**.
