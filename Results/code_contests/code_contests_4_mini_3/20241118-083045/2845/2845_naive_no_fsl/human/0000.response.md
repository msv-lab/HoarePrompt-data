Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected number of unique elements in the segment of the array from index l to index r. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The program calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array using `len(set(arr))`, which gives the count of unique elements in the entire array rather than in the segment defined by indices l and r.
2. The expected value calculation is incorrectly handled. The program simply adds 1 to the number of unique elements and divides by 2, which does not reflect the expected value of unique elements in the segment. The expected value needs to consider all possible pairs (l, r) and the unique counts for those segments, which the current implementation fails to do.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
In this case, if we choose (l, r) pairs:
- For (1, 2): unique count = 1
- For (1, 3): unique count = 2
- For (2, 3): unique count = 2
- For (1, 4): unique count = 2
- For (1, 5): unique count = 3
- For (2, 5): unique count = 3
... and so on.

The expected value should account for the average of all these unique counts across all possible (l, r) pairs, which the program does not do. Thus, the output of the program is incorrect for this case.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements.
