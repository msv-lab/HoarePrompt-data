The function reads an integer `n` from input, which indicates the number of subsequent integers to read. It then reads a list of `n` integers, calculates the number of unique integers in that list, and returns half of that count plus one (as an integer division). The function does not accept parameters directly, and it does not handle cases where the input is invalid or where `n` is zero, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
