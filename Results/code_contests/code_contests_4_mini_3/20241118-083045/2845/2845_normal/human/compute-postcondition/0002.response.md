The code calculates the number of unique elements in the list `arr` by converting it to a set and then determining its length. The variable `req` is assigned the value of the count of unique integers in `arr`. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation, and `arr` retains its original list of integers. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers; `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`.**
