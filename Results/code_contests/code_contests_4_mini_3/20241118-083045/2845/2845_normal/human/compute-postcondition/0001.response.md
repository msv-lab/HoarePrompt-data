The code assigns the variable `arr` the value of `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`, which takes a space-separated string input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then maps these integers into a list. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, but `arr` will now hold the list of integers input by the user. 

Since `arr` will contain `n` integers, the output state is that `arr` is now a list of `n` positive integers based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^6; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers based on the user's input**
