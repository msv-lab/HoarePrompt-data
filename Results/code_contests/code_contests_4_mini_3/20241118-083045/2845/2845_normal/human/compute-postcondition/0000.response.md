The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer that satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; `arr` is a list of n positive integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6**
