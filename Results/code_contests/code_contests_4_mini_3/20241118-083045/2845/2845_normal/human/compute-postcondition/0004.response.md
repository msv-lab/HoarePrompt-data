The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any parameters. However, it operates on an external input which consists of two main components: `n`, a positive integer, and `arr`, a list of `n` positive integers. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, so I will assume it has some form of return value based on the operations performed on these inputs.

The constraints state that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\). 

However, since the specific output or behavior of the function is not provided in the prompt, I cannot detail the exact return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates on an external positive integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` positive integers. The return value is not specified in the prompt.**
