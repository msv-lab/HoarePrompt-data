The expression `print(req + 1) / 2` results in the calculation involving the variable `req`. The value of `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, which is a positive integer. The output of the `print` statement does not affect the state of the other variables.

Since `req` is known and holds a value between 1 and `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 10^6, the expression calculates `(req + 1) / 2`. The value of `req + 1` will thus be in the range of 2 to (10^6 + 1), and dividing this by 2 will yield a result.

The return statement in this context does not apply since the code does not contain one. However, since the print statement outputs the value, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers; `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, and the output is (req + 1) / 2.**
