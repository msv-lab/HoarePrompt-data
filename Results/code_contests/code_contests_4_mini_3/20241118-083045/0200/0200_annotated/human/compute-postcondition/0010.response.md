The value of `diff` is incremented by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. The previous value of `diff` is 0, and since `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`, we can determine that `diff` will be updated based on the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. 

Since we don't have specific values for `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`, we cannot calculate an exact value for `diff`, but we know it will now be the product of those two terms added to its previous value.

Therefore, the output state is:
`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing at least the key `a[i]`, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to `a[i] * m[a[i]]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing at least the key `a[i]`, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to `diff + a[i] * m[a[i]]`**.
