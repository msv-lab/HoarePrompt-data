The variable `diff` is assigned the value `0`. The states of other variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, `cnt`, `a[i]`) remain unchanged as the assignment only affects `diff`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` retains its updated value from the last iteration; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `diff` is 0; `cnt` is 0; `a[i]` is the new current element in the list.
