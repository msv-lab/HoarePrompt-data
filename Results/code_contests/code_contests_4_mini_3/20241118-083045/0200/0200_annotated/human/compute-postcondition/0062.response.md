Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` will take values from `n - 1` down to `0`; `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` after the loop completes; `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations involving `sm`, `diff`, and `cnt` for each `a[i]`; `m` will be a dictionary where keys are the unique values from `a` and values are their respective counts; if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `sm` as 0, `ans` as 0, and `m` as an empty dictionary.**
