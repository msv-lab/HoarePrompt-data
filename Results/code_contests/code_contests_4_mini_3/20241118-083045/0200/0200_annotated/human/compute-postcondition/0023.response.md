The value of `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `m` and `a[i]` are not specified, but `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`, `ans`, `cnt`, and `diff`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is increased by `a[i]`; `m` is a dictionary with `m[a[i]]` incremented by 1; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; the value of `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is increased by `a[i]`; `m` is a dictionary with `m[a[i]]` incremented by 1; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; the value of `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`.**
