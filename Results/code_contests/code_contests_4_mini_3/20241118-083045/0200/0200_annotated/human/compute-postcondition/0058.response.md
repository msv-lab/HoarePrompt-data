The value of `a[i]` is accessed, where `i` is `n - 3`. The value of `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, `ans`, and `cnt` are not changed by this operation, but the state of `m[a[i]]` is updated. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the updates and unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 3]`; `ans` remains unchanged; `cnt` remains unchanged; `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1**
