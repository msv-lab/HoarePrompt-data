The line of code updates the variable `diff` by adding the product of `(a[i] + 1)` and `m[a[i] + 1]`. The value of `a[i]` is not specified in the initial state, but we know that `m[a[i] + 1]` depends on the value of `a[i]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `diff` is updated based on these calculations. 

Since `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`, we can assume that `m[a[i] + 1]` has a specific value that will be used in the multiplication, but this value is not provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`**
