The code updates the value of `diff` by adding the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. The variables `n`, `i`, `sm`, `ans`, `m`, and `cnt` are not directly modified by this statement. The value of `diff` is impacted by the product of the current values of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer within the specified range and `i` is derived from `n`, `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]` are assumed to be known based on the context. However, without specific values for `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`, we cannot determine the exact effect on `diff`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables and indicates that `diff` has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[n - 2] * (n - (n - 2) - 1 - cnt)`; if `a[n - 2]` is already a key in `m`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry for `a[n - 2]` is created in `m` with a value of 1; `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`; `diff` is updated by adding `a[i] * m[a[i]]`.**
