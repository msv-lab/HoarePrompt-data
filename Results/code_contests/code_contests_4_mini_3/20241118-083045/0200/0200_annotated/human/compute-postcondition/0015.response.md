Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, and `ans` is 0. If `a[i] + 1` is a key in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` is not in `m`, `cnt` remains unchanged, and `diff` stays the same. This accounts for the presence or absence of `a[i] + 1` in the dictionary `m`.***
