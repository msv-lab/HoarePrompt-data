The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`, but it does not change the states of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary {}; `ans` is 0.
