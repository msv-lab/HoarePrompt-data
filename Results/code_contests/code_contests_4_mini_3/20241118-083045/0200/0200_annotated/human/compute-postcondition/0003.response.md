The code initializes `m` as a dictionary. The previous values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `sm`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the new state of `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary {}**
