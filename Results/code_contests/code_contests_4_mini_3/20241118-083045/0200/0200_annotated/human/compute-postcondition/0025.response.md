The statement `m[a[i]] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `m`. Since `a[i]` is not a key in the dictionary `m` before this operation, it will be added as a new key with the value `1`. The previous state of the other variables, `n`, `i`, `sm`, and `ans`, is unaffected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the update to the dictionary only.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is increased by `a[i]`; `m[a[i]]` is set to 1; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)**.
