The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`. The variables `n`, `i`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, and `diff` remain unchanged, but `cnt` is updated based on the current value of `m` at the key `a[i] + 1`. Since `a[i]` and `m`'s structure is not specified, we cannot define the exact values but can describe the relationship with respect to `cnt`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is updated based on `m[a[i] + 1]`.**
