The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, `diff`, `cnt`, and `a[i]`) are unchanged, except for `cnt`, which is now explicitly set to `0`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt` is now `0`, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` retains its updated value from the last iteration; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `diff` remains unchanged; `cnt` is 0; `a[i]` is the new current element in the list.**
