Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i]` is already a key in `m`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry for `a[i]` is created in `m` with a value of 1.***
