Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` retains its updated value from the last iteration; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `diff` is updated by adding `a[i] * m[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is present in `m`, and `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, both `diff` and `cnt` remain unchanged.***
