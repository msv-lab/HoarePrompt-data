The value of `sm` is incremented by `a[i]`. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, thus `a[i]` corresponds to the value at the index `n - 3` in the array `a`. The values of `n`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `sm` which is now `sm + a[n - 3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 3]`; `ans` remains unchanged; `cnt` remains unchanged.**
