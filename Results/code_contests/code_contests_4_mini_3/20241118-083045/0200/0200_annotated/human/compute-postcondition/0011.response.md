Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, and both `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on the presence of `a[i]` in `m`. If `a[i]` is a key in `m`, then `cnt` is set to `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is increased by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, then `cnt` remains 0 and `diff` remains unchanged.***
