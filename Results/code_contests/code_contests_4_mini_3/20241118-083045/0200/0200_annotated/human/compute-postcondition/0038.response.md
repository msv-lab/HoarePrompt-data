Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` retains its updated value from the last iteration; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i] - 1` is present in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` is not present in `m`, both `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. This covers the cases where `a[i]` is greater than 1, equal to 1 (leading to no change since `0` would not be present in `m`), and any boundary conditions relative to the values in `m`.***
