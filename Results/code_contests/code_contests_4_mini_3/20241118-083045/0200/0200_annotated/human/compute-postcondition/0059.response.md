The code assigns the value `1` to the dictionary or list `m` at the index `a[i]`. The variable `i` is `n - 3`, so `a[i]` refers to the value at index `n - 3` in the list `a`. The other variables (`n`, `sm`, `ans`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 3]`; `ans` remains unchanged; `cnt` remains unchanged; `m[a[i]]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 3]`; `ans` remains unchanged; `cnt` remains unchanged; `m[a[i]]` is set to 1.**
