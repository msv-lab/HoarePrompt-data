The variable `sm` is initialized to 0, and there are no changes to other variables. The initial values of `n` and `a` remain unaffected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0**
