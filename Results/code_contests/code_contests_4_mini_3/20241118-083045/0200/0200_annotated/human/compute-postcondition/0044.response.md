To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided state and the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\)
- `i` is \(n - 2\)
- `sm` is updated to \(sm + a[i]\)
- `ans` is updated by adding \(sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)\)
- If \(a[i]\) is already a key in \(m\), its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry for \(a[i]\) is created in \(m\) with a value of 1.

Now, looking at the loop:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This loop iterates from \(i = n - 1\) down to \(i = 0\). The current value of \(i\) at the end of the last iteration is \(n - 2\).

For the loop to execute one more time, \(i\) needs to be decremented by 1, which means \(i\) should become \(n - 3\). 

Checking the limits:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as \(i\) remains greater than or equal to 0. Since \(i\) is currently \(n - 2\), for the next iteration, it would become \(n - 3\), which is valid as long as \(n\) is greater than or equal to 3.

Thus, the necessary state adjustments are:
- `i` should be adjusted to \(n - 3\).

No other states need to be adjusted since the values of `sm`, `ans`, and `m` are updated in the loop body but do not impact whether the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the updated state will be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]` (the value of `a[i]` in the previous iteration); `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[n - 2] * (n - (n - 2) - 1 - cnt)`; if `a[n - 2]` is already a key in `m`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry for `a[n - 2]` is created in `m` with a value of 1.**
