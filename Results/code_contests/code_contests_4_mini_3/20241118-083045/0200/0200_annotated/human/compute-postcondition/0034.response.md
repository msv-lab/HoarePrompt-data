Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` retains its updated value from the last iteration; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` if `a[i] + 1` is present in `m`; `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i]]` and `m[a[i] + 1]`.**
