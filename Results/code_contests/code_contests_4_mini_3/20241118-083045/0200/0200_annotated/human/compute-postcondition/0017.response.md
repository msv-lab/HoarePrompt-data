The value of `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]`. The variable `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i] - 1` is a valid key in dictionary `m`. The previous values of `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged as stated. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `cnt` after the addition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` remains unchanged.**
