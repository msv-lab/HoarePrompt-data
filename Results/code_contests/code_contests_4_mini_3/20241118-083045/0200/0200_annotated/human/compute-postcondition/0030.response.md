The value of `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, and `m[a[i]]` reflects the value associated with the current element in the list at index `a[i]`. Since `m` remains unchanged, it will not affect other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` retains its updated value from the last iteration; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `diff` is 0; `cnt` is the updated value after adding `m[a[i]]`.
