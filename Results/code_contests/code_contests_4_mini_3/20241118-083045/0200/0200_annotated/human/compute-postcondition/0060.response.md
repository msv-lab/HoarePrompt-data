Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 3]`; `ans` remains unchanged; `cnt` remains unchanged; if `a[i]` is already a key in the dictionary `m`, then its corresponding value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `m[a[i]]` is initialized to 1.***
