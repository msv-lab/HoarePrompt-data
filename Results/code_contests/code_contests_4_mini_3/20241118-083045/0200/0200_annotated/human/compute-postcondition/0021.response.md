The value of `sm` is incremented by `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `sm` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `sm` is increased by an unknown value `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is increased by `a[i]`; `m` is a dictionary; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)**
