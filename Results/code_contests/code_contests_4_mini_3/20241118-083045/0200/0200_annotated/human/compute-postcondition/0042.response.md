The code `m[a[i]] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary or list `m`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (a positive integer), `i` (which is `n - 2`), and `a[i]` (the value at index `i` in the list `a`). The state of `sm`, `m`, and `ans` is not directly affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `m` has a new entry `m[a[i]]` set to 1; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `m` has a new entry `m[a[i]]` set to 1; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**.
