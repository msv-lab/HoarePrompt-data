In the provided code snippet, `a` is assigned a list created by mapping the `int` function to each value from the input received through `raw_input()`. The values that form this list will be based on the user's input, which is a space-separated string of integers.

Since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200000, the list `a` will contain exactly `n` integers that follow the specified constraints (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). 

The input will directly affect the state of `a`, but `n` remains unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new state of `a` as a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9**
