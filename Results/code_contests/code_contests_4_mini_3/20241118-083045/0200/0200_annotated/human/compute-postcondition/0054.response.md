The value of `diff` is incremented by the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. The values of `sm`, `ans`, and the entry for `a[n - 2]` in `m` remain unchanged. The previous value of `diff` is unknown, and the effect on `cnt` is not applicable in this context. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[n - 3] - 1]` if it exists, `diff` is updated, `sm` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, and the entry for `a[n - 2]` in `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is incremented by `m[a[n - 3] - 1]` if it exists, `diff` is updated, `sm` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, and the entry for `a[n - 2]` in `m` remains unchanged.**
