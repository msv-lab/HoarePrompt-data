The code assigns `0` to the variable `diff`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary {}, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `diff` is 0.
