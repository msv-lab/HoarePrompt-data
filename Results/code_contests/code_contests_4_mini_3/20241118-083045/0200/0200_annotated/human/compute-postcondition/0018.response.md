The value of `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `a[i]`, `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` remains unchanged until this operation is executed. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i]` corresponds to the last element of the list `a`. 

The impact of the code on the program results in `diff` being updated with a new value based on the computation. However, we don't have specific values for `a[i]` or `m[a[i] - 1]`, so we can't calculate the exact new value of `diff`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`**.
