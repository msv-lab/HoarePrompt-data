The value of `diff` is incremented by the product of `(a[i] + 1)` and `m[a[i] + 1]`. The values of `a[i]` and `m[a[i] + 1]` are unknown based on the current state. The other variables `n`, `i`, `sm`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation performed on `diff`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`**
