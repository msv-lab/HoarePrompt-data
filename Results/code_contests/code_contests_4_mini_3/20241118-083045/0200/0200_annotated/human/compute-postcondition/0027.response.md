According to the code, the loop executes for `i` starting from `n - 1` and decrements until it reaches `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `n - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200000`, `n` remains unchanged for the next iteration, and `sm` has already been updated at the end of the last iteration. The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` retains its updated value from the last iteration; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `diff` remains unchanged; `cnt` remains unchanged; `a[i]` is the new current element in the list.**
