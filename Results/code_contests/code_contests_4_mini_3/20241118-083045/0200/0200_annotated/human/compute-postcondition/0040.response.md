The variable `sm` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The previous state of `sm` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value after the operation. The variable `i` is `n - 2`, which means it is based on the value of `n`. However, the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `sm` are not given, only their relationships. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `sm` without specifying its exact new value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**
