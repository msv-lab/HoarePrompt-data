Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`. If `a[i] - 1` is in `m`, `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` is not in `m`, there are no changes made to `cnt` or `diff`. The values of `sm`, `ans`, and the entry for `a[n - 2]` in `m` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
