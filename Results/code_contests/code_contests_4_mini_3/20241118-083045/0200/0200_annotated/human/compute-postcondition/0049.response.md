Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; if `a[i]` is found in `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is updated by adding `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]`, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[n - 2] * (n - (n - 2) - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[n - 2]` is already a key in `m`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry for `a[n - 2]` is created in `m` with a value of 1. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, there are no changes made to `cnt`, `diff`, `sm`, or `ans`.***
