The value of `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`, where `a[i]` is a key in the dictionary `m`. The specific value of `cnt` will change based on the value found in `m` for the key `a[i]`. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, and the value of `m[a[i]]` is not explicitly stated, so we denote it as `x`. Therefore, after execution, `cnt` becomes `0 + m[a[i]]`, which is `m[a[i]]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing at least the key `a[i]`, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is 0**
