Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates a value `ans` based on the sum of the elements in `a`, their occurrences, and adjacent values, which is printed at the end. The function does not return any value. If `n` is 0, the output will simply be 0 as no calculations are performed. **
