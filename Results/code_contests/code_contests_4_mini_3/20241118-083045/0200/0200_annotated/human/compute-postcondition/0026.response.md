Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is increased by `a[i]`. If `a[i]` exists in dictionary `m`, then `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i]` does not exist in dictionary `m`, then `m[a[i]]` is set to 1, and `ans` is updated in the same manner. In both cases, `sm` retains its updated value from the addition of `a[i]`.***
