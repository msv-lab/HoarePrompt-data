The variable `diff` is assigned a value of 0. The values of other variables `n`, `i`, `sm`, `ans`, `m`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains dependent on their previous values. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 3`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[n - 2] * (n - (n - 2) - 1 - cnt)`; if `a[n - 2]` is already a key in `m`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry for `a[n - 2]` is created in `m` with a value of 1; `cnt` is 0; `diff` is 0.**
