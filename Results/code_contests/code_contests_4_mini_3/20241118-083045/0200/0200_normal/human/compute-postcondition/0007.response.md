The variable `diff` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables, and we note the new value of `diff`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0**
