The value of `sm` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is initialized to `n - 1`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, the new value of `sm` will be equal to its previous value (which is 0) plus `a[n - 1]`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and `cnt`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `sm`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is updated by the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
