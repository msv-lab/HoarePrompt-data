The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, and `cnt` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, `cnt` is 0**
