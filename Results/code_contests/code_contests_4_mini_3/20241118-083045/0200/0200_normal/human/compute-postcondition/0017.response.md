The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value associated with the key `a[i] - 1` in the dictionary `m`. Since it is stated that the value `a[i] - 1` exists in the dictionary, `m[a[i] - 1]` will yield a specific integer value which increases `cnt`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `cnt` based on its previous value and the value retrieved from the dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is 0**
