The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is updated by the expression with `i` now being `n - 2`, and `cnt` is 0.
