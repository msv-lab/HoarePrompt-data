Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, and `ans` is updated by the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` where `i` is `n - 1`. If `a[n - 1]` is already a key in dictionary `m`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[n - 1]` is added as a new key in `m` with a value of 1. In both cases, `ans` is updated correctly based on the mentioned expression, ensuring that all possible scenarios for the presence of `a[n - 1]` in `m` are handled.***
