The variable `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]` to its previous value. The values of `a[i]` and `m[a[i] - 1]` are not specified, but we know that `a[i]` is the last element in the list `a`, and `m` is a dictionary that has a key of `a[i] - 1`. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `diff` based on the calculation performed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is updated by adding (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]**
