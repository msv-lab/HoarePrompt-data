According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, which it is since it is given as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). The loop will iterate from `n - 1` down to `0`, meaning `i` will take values starting from `n - 1` and decrements to `0`.

At the beginning of the loop, `i` will be initialized to `n - 1`. The variables `a`, `sm`, `m`, and `ans` do not affect whether the loop can execute, but we note that `a` is a list of integers based on user input, which means it is expected to have elements corresponding to the range of `i`.

So for the loop to execute properly, we need to establish that `i` starts at `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1**
