Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers. The variable `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`. The variable `cnt` remains 0, `diff` remains 0, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is already a key in the dictionary `m`, then `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m[a[i]]` is initialized to 1. In both cases, `m` accurately reflects the count of occurrences of `a[i]` in the list `a`.***
