The code assigns `a` the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the result of `raw_input().split()`. This means `a` will be filled with integers that are inputted as a space-separated string. The initial state does not affect this operation directly, but it implies that `n` determines how many integers will be in the list `a`.

Since the exact input for `raw_input()` is not specified, we can only conclude that `a` will contain `n` integers, each within the range specified (1 to 10^9). Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now a list of integers based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers based on user input, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9**
