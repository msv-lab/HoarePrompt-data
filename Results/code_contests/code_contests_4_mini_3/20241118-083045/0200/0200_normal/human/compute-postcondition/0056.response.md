Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; if `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`; if `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged; `ans` is updated to `ans + sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**.
