The code increments `cnt` by `m[a[i] + 1]`. The value of `a[i]` is known, and since `m` is a dictionary (or similar structure), we need to access the value at key `a[i] + 1`. The values of `cnt`, `sm`, `diff`, and `ans` are also checked. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly stated.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`.
- `sm`, `diff`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The states of `a`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`; `diff` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged.**
