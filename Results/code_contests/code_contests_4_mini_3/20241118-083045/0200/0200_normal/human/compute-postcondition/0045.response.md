The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`, but it already has that value. The other variables `sm`, `diff`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `a`, `n`, and `i` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables that were not changed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` remains 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
