The variable `ans` is assigned the value of 0. The initial values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, and `m` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers based on user input where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary; and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers based on user input where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0**
