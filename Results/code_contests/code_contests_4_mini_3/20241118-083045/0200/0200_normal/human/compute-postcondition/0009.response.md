The value of `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`. The variable `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, which exists in the dictionary `m`. Therefore, `cnt` is increased by the value of `m` corresponding to the key `a[n - 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, `cnt` is increased by m[a[n - 1]], `diff` is 0, and the last element of `a` exists in the dictionary `m`.**
