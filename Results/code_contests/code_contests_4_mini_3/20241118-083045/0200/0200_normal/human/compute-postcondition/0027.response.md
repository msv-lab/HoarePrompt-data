According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `n - 2` in the next iteration.

The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`a`, `sm`, `ans`, and `m`) do not need to be updated, as their state at the end of the previous iteration is already consistent with the expected behavior for the next iteration.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to change `i` to `n - 2`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is updated by the expression with `i` now being `n - 2`**
