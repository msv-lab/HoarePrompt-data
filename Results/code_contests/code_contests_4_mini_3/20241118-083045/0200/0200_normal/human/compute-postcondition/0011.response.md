Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `cnt` and `diff` are both initialized to 0. If `a[n - 1]` (the last element of `a`) exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[n - 1]]` and `diff` is updated to `a[n - 1] * m[a[n - 1]]`. If `a[n - 1]` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
