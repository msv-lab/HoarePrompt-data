Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is updated by the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `i` is `n - 1`, and the last element of `a`, which is `a[i]`, is present in the dictionary `m`.***
