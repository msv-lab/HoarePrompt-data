Output State: **`sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is the accumulated result calculated through the loop based on the formula provided, and `m` is a dictionary containing the counts of each unique integer from the list `a`. The variable `i` will take values from `n - 1` down to `0`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, resulting in `sm` remaining 0, `ans` remaining 0, and `m` remaining an empty dictionary. For cases where `n` is 1, the loop executes once, processing the single element in `a`. If all elements in `a` are unique, `m` will contain each element as a key with a value of 1.**
