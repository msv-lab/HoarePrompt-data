Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`. If `a[i]` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]` and `diff` is updated to `diff + a[i] * m[a[i]]`; otherwise, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. `ans` remains unchanged throughout.***
