The expression `diff += (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` attempts to update the variable `diff`. The value of `diff` is increased by the product of `(a[i] + 1)` and `m[a[i] + 1]`, provided that `m[a[i] + 1]` exists. The initial state indicates that `cnt` is increased by a similar value, but since we are not provided with the values of `a`, `m`, or `diff`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `diff`. 

Therefore, if `m[a[i] + 1]` does not exist, the state remains unchanged. If it does exist, the value of `diff` is increased accordingly. The output state must reflect the uncertainty of `m[a[i] + 1]` existing or not.

Output State: **`diff` is increased by `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` if `m[a[i] + 1]` exists; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
