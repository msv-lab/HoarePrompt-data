Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sm` is the last element of `a`, and both `cnt` and `diff` are initially 0. If `a[i] + 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] + 1)` and `m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. The code properly handles the case where `a[i] + 1` is equal to an existing key in `m`, ensuring that both `cnt` and `diff` are updated accordingly. If `a[i] + 1` is not present in `m`, the values of `cnt` and `diff` remain at their initial values of 0.***
