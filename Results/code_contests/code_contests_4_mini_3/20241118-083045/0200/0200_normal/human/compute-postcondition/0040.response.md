The value of `sm` is incremented by `a[i]`. The previous value of `sm` is the last element of `a`, and it will now be updated to include the value of `a[i]`. The other variables (`n`, `cnt`, `diff`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `sm` while retaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged**.
