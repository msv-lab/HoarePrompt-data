Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `a[i] - 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by the count of occurrences of `a[i] - 1` in `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and its count in `m`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, then `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. This accounts for all possible cases where `a[i]` is the last element of the list.***
