Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, and `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`. If `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. Throughout this process, `ans` remains unchanged.***
