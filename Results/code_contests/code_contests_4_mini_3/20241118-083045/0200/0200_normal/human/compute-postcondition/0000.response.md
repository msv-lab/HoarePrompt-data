The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is not defined, but it is stated that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000. The list `a` remains unchanged in this state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` will now hold the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9**
