The variable `sm` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `sm`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers based on user input, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0**
