According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` down to `0`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` would have been decremented to `-1` after processing the last element of the list `a`, which means the loop will not execute again since the condition `i >= 0` will not hold true.

To enable the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` back to `n - 1` (the starting point of the loop). The values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, `cnt`, `diff`, and `ans` do not need any adjustments as they remain unchanged.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`, `cnt` remains 0, `diff` remains 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
