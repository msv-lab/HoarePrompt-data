The variable `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. The values of `a`, `i`, `sm`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Since `i` is `n - 1`, it refers to the last element of the list `a`. The output state will reflect the update to `diff`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] - 1]`; `diff` is updated by adding (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]; `ans` remains unchanged.**
