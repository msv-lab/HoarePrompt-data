The statement `diff += (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` updates the variable `diff` by adding the product of `(a[i] + 1)` and `m[a[i] + 1]` to its current value. The values of `a[i]` and `m[a[i] + 1]` are utilized in this calculation. Since `i` is `n - 1`, it refers to the last element of the list `a`.

The state of other variables (`sm`, `ans`, `cnt`) and their values are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will summarize the relevant variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is increased by `(a[n - 1] + 1) * m[a[n - 1] + 1]`**
