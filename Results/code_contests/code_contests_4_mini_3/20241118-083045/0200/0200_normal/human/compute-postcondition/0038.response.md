Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sm` is the last element of `a`, and both `cnt` and `diff` are initially 0. If `a[i] - 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, then `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged at their initial values of 0. This logic ensures that the update to `cnt` and `diff` only occurs when a valid key is found in `m`, handling edge cases where `a[i]` is at its minimum or maximum values, as well as cases where `m` may be empty or have no keys corresponding to `a[i] - 1`.***
