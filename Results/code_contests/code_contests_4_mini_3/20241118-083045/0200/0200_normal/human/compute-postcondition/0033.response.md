The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`. However, we do not have the specific value of `i`, and without knowing `a[i]`, we cannot determine `m[a[i] + 1]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt` is increased, but we cannot specify by how much or if `m[a[i] + 1]` exists.

Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]` if it exists; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
