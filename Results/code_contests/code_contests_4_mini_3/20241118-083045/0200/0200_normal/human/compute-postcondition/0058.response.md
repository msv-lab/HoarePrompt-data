To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the current variable states:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`.

2. The code `m[a[i]] += 1` increments the count in the `m` list (or dictionary) at the index corresponding to the value of `a[i]`.

3. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i]` refers to the last element of the list `a`. The actual value of `a[i]` will depend on the specific content of the list `a`.

4. The variable `m` is expected to be initialized (though not shown in the initial state). We assume `m` is a list or dictionary that can accommodate the values in `a`.

5. The operation `m[a[i]] += 1` suggests that the count for the element `a[i]` in `m` is being increased by 1. 

6. The value of `sm` is updated but does not affect the output state directly since we don't have its prior value or its impact on other variables.

Therefore, the output state includes the effects of the code execution on the variables `a`, `i`, and `m`, without changing the known state of `sm`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1; m[a[i]]` is updated to `m[a[i]] + 1**.
