The value of `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`, where `a[i]` is the last element of the list `a` (since `i` is `n - 1`). The previous values of `sm`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged, while `diff` is updated based on the current values of `a[i]` and `m[a[i] + 1]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `diff` while noting that `sm`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`; `diff` is updated; `ans` remains unchanged.**
