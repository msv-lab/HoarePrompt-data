Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from user input. It calculates a result `ans` based on a specific formula that considers the sum of elements in the list, their counts, and their neighboring values. The function then prints the final value of `ans`. However, the function does not accept parameters directly, and the behavior of the function is dependent on user input, which may lead to undefined behavior if the input is not as expected. Additionally, there is no return value, and its output is solely through printing. **
