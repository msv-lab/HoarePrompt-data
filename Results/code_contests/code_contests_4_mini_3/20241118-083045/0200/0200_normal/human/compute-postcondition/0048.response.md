The line of code updates the value of `diff` by adding the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]` to it. The variable `i` holds the value `n - 1`, meaning it points to the last element in the list `a`. The values of `sm`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`; `diff` is updated to `diff + a[i] * m[a[i]]`; `ans` remains unchanged.
