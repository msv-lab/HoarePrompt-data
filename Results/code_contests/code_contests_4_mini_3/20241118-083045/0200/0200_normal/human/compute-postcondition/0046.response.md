The value of `diff` is assigned 0, but it was already 0. Therefore, there is no change to the state of the other variables. The output state remains unchanged with respect to the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged**.
