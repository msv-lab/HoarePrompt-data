According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`, which starts at `n - 1` and decrements down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `n - 2`, allowing the loop to process the next integer in the list `a`.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\), and `i` is currently `n - 1`, it will be adjusted to `n - 2` for the next iteration. The state of `a` and `m` remains unchanged, and `sm` also remains unchanged as stated.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 2`**
