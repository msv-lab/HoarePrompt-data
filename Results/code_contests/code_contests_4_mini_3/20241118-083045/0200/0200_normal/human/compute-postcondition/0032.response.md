Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sm` is the last element of `a`, and `cnt` and `diff` are both initially 0. If `a[n - 2]` (the second to last element of `a`) is present in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[n - 2]]` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[n - 2]` and `m[a[n - 2]]`. In the case where `a[n - 2]` is not present in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
