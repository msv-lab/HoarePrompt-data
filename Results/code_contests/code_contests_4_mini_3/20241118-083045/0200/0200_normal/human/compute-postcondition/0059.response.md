The code updates the list `m` at the index `a[i]` with the value `1`. The variable `i` is `n - 1`, which refers to the last element of the list `a`. Consequently, `a[i]` is equal to `a[n - 1]`, the last integer in the list. The value of `m[a[i]]` will be set to `1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected, so after executing the code, we have:

- `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000,
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers,
- `i` remains `n - 1`,
- `sm` remains updated to `sm + a[i]`,
- and `m[a[i]]` is now `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `m[a[i]]` is 1**
