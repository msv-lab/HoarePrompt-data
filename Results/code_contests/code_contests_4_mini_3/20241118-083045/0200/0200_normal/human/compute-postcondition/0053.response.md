The value of `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]`. The previous value of `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i]` is the last element in the list `a`. The state of `m` and the value of `a[i]` directly affect the value of `cnt`. The values of `sm`, `diff`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and we do not have information about the previous values of `cnt` or `m[a[i] - 1]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`; `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] - 1]`; `diff` and `ans` remain unchanged.
