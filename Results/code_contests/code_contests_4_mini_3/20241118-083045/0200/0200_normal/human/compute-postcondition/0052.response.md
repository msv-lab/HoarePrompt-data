Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`. If `a[i] + 1` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated to `diff + (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. `ans` remains unchanged throughout.***
