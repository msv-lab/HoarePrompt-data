The code initializes `m` as an empty dictionary. There are no changes to the values of `n`, `a`, or `sm`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new state of `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers based on user input, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary**
