Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `n - 1`; if the integer `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`, then its count is incremented by 1, otherwise, `m[a[i]]` is set to 1. In either case, `sm` remains unchanged as it is not updated within this block.***
