The function accepts a positive integer `k` and a list of integers `candy_array`. It counts the maximum number of pairs of integers in `candy_array` such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`. The function uses a dictionary to track the occurrences of remainder values when candies are divided by `k`. It returns the total count of such pairs, each contributing 2 to the result. If `candy_array` is empty, the function returns 0. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Therefore, the functionality is to compute and print the number of valid pairs but lacks an actual return statement.
