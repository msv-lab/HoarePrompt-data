The code updates the `res_map` dictionary based on the value of `candy % k`. The `candy` variable is the second element of `candy_array`, and since `candy_array` has at least 2 elements, `candy` has a specific value.

1. Calculate `candy % k`. This operation determines the remainder when `candy` is divided by `k`.
2. If the key `candy % k` exists in `res_map`, its value is incremented by 1. If it does not exist, it is initialized to 1.

The state of other variables (`k`, `n`, `candy_array`, and `candy`) remains unchanged, and only the `res_map` is affected.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `res_map` is updated based on `candy % k`.**
