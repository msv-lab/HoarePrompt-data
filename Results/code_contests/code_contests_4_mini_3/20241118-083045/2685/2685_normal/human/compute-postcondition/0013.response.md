Postcondition: ***`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2, and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. If not, `res_map` is updated such that if it already has the key `candy % k`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, the key is added with a value of 1. This ensures that `res_map` accurately reflects the occurrences of the modulo operation results in relation to `k` and `candy`.***
