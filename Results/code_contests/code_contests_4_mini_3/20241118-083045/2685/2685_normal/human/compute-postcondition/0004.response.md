The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res_map` is a dictionary containing the key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, `res` is 2, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res_map` is a dictionary containing the key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, `res` is 2, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`.**
