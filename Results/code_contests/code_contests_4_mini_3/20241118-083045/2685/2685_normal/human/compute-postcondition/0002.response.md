According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If the list has at least 1 candy box, the loop can execute. Given that `k`, `n`, `res_map`, and `res` do not directly affect the execution of the loop but only the state of the loop's variables, we need to ensure that `candy_array` is not empty. 

Since `candy_array` is currently unspecified in terms of its length, we must ensure it has at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we can state that `candy_array` contains at least one integer representing the number of candies in a box.

At the beginning of the loop, `candy` should be the first element in `candy_array`.

State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`**
