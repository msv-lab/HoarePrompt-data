The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The values of `k`, `n`, `candy_array`, and `res_map` remain unchanged as this line only impacts the state of `res`. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers where each integer (d_i) represents the number of candies in a box (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9), `res_map` is an empty dictionary, and `res` is 0.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers where each integer (d_i) represents the number of candies in a box (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9), `res_map` is an empty dictionary, and `res` is 0**
