The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` and `candy_array`. The parameter `k` is a positive integer that must be between 1 and 100, inclusive. The parameter `candy_array` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of candies in a box, and each integer must be between 1 and 10^9. 

The function's output is determined based on the relationship between the values of `k` and the total number of candies in `candy_array`. Specifically, it returns the maximum number of boxes that can be filled with `k` candies each, based on the total number of candies available in `candy_array`.
