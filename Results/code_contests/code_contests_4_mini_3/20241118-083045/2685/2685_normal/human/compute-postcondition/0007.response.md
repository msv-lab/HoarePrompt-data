The code updates the `res_map` dictionary based on the value of `candy % k`. Since `candy` is the first element of `candy_array` and `res_map` is initially empty, the code checks if the key `candy % k` exists in `res_map`. If it does not exist, it initializes it with the value 1. If it does exist, it increments the current value by 1. 

The output state will reflect the updated `res_map` with the new count for the key `candy % k`. The other variables, `res`, `candy`, and `k`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100); `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `res_map` is updated with the key `candy % k`; `res` is 0; `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`.**
