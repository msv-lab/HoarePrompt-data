According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `candy_array`. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`. For the loop to execute one more time, `candy_array` must have at least 4 elements, and `candy` should be the fourth element in the list. 

State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, and `candy` is the fourth element in `candy_array`.**
