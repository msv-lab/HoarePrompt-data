Output State: **`res` is the sum of pairs of candies from `candy_array` that satisfy the condition `(candy_i + candy_j) % k == 0`, where `candy_i` is from `candy_array`, and `candy_j` is the corresponding candy that complements it as per `k - candy % k`. `res_map` is a dictionary that contains the count of occurrences of each `candy % k` value. If `candy_array` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains 0 while `res_map` remains an empty dictionary.**
