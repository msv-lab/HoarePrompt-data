To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions surrounding the iteration of the loop based on the provided state at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The loop iterates over `candy_array`, which is a list of integers with at least 1 element. Since `candy_array` has at least one element, it allows for at least one iteration of the loop.

2. The variable `candy` is assigned the first element of the `candy_array` during the first iteration and will take on the next element in subsequent iterations. 

3. Since `candy_array` has at least one element, after performing the operations in the current iteration, we need to ensure that `candy` is assigned the next element in `candy_array` for the loop to execute again. 

4. The next value of `candy` will depend on the number of elements in `candy_array`. If `candy` is currently the last element, there will be no next element, and the loop cannot execute again. Thus, we need to ensure that there are more elements in `candy_array` for the loop to run one more time.

5. The key condition for the loop to execute again is that the length of `candy_array` must be greater than the current index of `candy` in `candy_array`.

Given that the current state indicates that `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, we can assume that there is at least one more element remaining for the loop to continue.

Assuming that `candy_array` contains at least two elements, the next state should reflect that `candy` is now the second element in the list.

State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`.**
