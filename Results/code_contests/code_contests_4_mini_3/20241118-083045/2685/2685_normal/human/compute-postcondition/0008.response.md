Postcondition: ***`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the count for `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decremented by 1. If not, `res_map` is updated to set the key `candy % k` to 1 if it does not exist, or incremented by 1 if it does. In any case, `res_map` is modified according to the conditions, and `res` remains 0 if the if condition is false.***
