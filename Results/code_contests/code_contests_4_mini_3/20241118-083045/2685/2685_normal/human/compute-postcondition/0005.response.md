The statement updates the dictionary `res_map` by decrementing the value associated with the key `k - candy % k`. The initial value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is greater than 0, so after the decrement, it will still be non-negative. The other variables (`k`, `n`, `candy_array`, `res`, `candy`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res_map` is a dictionary with updated value for key `k - candy % k`, `res` is 2, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`.**
