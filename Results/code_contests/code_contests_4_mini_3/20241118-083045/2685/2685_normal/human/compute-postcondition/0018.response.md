Postcondition: ***`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1 if it already exists in `res_map`, or it is set to 1 if it does not exist. This ensures that the mapping in `res_map` is updated based on the modulus operation with respect to `k`, and the resulting value of `res` is adjusted accordingly based on the conditions met.***
