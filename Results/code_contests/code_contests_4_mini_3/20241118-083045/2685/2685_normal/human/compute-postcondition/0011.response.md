To analyze the given code snippet, we know the following from the initial state:

- `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000.
- `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, which means `candy_array[1]`.
- `res` has been increased by 2 prior to this operation.

Now, we look at the line of code:

```
res_map[k - candy % k] = res_map[k - candy % k] - 1
```

This line modifies the `res_map` dictionary (or list) at the index calculated by `k - candy % k`. Let's break it down:

1. Calculate `candy % k`, which gives the remainder when `candy` is divided by `k`.
2. Subtract that remainder from `k`, resulting in the index for `res_map`.
3. Decrease the value at that index in `res_map` by 1.

Since `res_map` is being updated, we assume it has been initialized and has enough elements to accommodate the index `k - candy % k`. The operation directly modifies `res_map`, but does not affect `k`, `n`, `candy`, or `res`.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables, indicating that `res_map` has been modified.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, `res` is increased by 2, and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1.**
