The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it will now hold a new value which is the previous value plus 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `res` is increased by 2.
