According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If the array has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the second element in the `candy_array`, which means the current index of the loop was 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, the index needs to be incremented to 2, and `candy` should be the third element in the `candy_array`. 

Since `candy_array` is confirmed to have at least 2 elements, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, it must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`.**
