Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, if `res_map` has a key of `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the count of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res_map` is updated such that the count of `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, or set to 1 if it does not. In either case, the integrity of `res_map` is maintained as a count of the occurrences of the relevant modulo values.***
