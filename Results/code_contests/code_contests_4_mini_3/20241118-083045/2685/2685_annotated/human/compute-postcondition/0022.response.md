The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` and `candy_array`. The parameter `k` is a positive integer, constrained between 1 and 100. The parameter `candy_array` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of candies in each box, with the constraint that each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The functionality of the function is to process the `candy_array` in relation to the value of `k` and return specific results based on that processing. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer k and a list of integers candy_array, processes the candy_array based on the value of k, and returns a result accordingly.**
