The `res` variable is incremented by 2. Since `res` is initially 0, its new value becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and `res_map`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res` is 2**
