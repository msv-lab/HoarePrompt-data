The line of code modifies the `res_map` dictionary at the key `k - candy % k`. The previous value of `candy` is known as it is the third element of `candy_array`, and `k` is a positive integer. The value of `res_map` at the specified key is decremented by 1. 

The other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value in `res_map`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, `res` is increased by 2, and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1.**
