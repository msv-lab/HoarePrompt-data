The code initializes an empty dictionary `res_map`. This does not change the values of `n`, `k`, or `candy_array`, but it establishes a new variable `res_map` in the current state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `k`, and `candy_array`, along with the new variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers, and `res_map` is an empty dictionary.**
