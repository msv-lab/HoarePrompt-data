The value of `res` is incremented by 2, but the previous value of `res` is not specified. Other variables, including `n`, `k`, `candy_array`, and `candy`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `res` is updated by adding 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `res` is updated by adding 2.**
