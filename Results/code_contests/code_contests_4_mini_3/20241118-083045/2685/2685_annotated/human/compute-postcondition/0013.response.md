Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 2, and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `res_map[candy % k]` is updated to either its current value incremented by 1 or set to 1 if `candy % k` was not previously a key in `res_map`. The state of `res` and `res_map` reflects these updates based on the checks performed.***
