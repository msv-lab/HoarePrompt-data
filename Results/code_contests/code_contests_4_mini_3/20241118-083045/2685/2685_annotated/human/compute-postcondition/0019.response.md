According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `candy_array`. If `candy_array` has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, which means the current index is 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, the index must be 3, and `candy` must be the fourth element in `candy_array`. Since we know `candy_array` has at least 3 elements, we can ensure that it has at least 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `candy` is the fourth element in `candy_array`**
