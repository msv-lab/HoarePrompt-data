Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res` is 0. The value of `candy` modulo `k` is such that there exists a key in `res_map` equal to `k - candy % k`, and the value associated with that key in `res_map` is greater than 0.***
