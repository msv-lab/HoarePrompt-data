The code updates the `res_map` dictionary based on the value of `candy % k`. The specific value of `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `k` is a positive integer. The code checks if `res_map` already contains a key for `candy % k`. 

1. Calculate `candy % k`.
2. If `res_map` has the key `candy % k`, increment its value by 1.
3. If `res_map` does not have the key, set its value to 1.

Since we do not have the exact values of `candy_array`, `candy`, and `res_map`, we can only describe the action taken based on the given conditions. 

Output State: **`res_map` is updated based on the value of `candy % k`.**
