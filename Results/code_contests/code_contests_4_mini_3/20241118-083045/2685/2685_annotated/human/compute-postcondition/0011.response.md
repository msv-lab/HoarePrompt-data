The code updates the `res_map` dictionary, specifically modifying the entry at the key `k - candy % k`. The value of `candy` is taken from `candy_array`, specifically the second element. Since `candy` is an integer, `candy % k` calculates the remainder when `candy` is divided by `k`. The result of this operation is subtracted from `k`, and the corresponding entry in `res_map` is decremented by 1.

Now, since the values of `n`, `k`, `candy_array`, and `candy` are not directly stated, we can summarize the impact:

- `res_map[k - candy % k]` is accessed and decremented by 1.
- The previous state of `res_map` at this key will be reduced by 1.

As a result, the output state will be:

Output State: **`res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1**
