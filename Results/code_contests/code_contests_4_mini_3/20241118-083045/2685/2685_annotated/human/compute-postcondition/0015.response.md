The value of `res` is incremented by 2, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The values of `n`, `k`, `candy_array`, and `candy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, and `res` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, and `res` is increased by 2**
