Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, and `res` is updated based on the condition. If `res_map` has a key corresponding to `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is incremented by 2 and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if it did not exist previously. The values of `res_map` reflect the update based on the modulo operation with `candy` and `k`.***
