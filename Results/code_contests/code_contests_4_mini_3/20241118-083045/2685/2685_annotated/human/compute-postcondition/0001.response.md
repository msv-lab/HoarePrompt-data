The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `candy_array`, and `res_map` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `res`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, and `res` is 0**
