According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `candy_array`. For the loop to execute at least once, `candy_array` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is a positive integer, it suggests that `candy_array` has a size of `n` and hence will have at least one element. 

At the end of the last iteration, `res` is initialized to 0. Before the loop starts executing, the variable `candy` should be set to the first element in the `candy_array`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `candy_array` must have at least 1 element, `candy` should be the first element of `candy_array`, and `res` remains 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res` is 0**
