Output State: **`res` is equal to twice the number of pairs of candies that satisfy the condition (k - candy % k) found in `res_map`. `res_map` contains counts of occurrences of each modulo value of candies with respect to `k`. If `candy_array` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains 0 while `res_map` remains an empty dictionary. If `candy_array` has at least one element, the loop will execute for each candy in the list, updating `res` and `res_map` accordingly.**
