The function accepts a positive integer `k` and a list of integers `candy_array`. It counts and prints the total number of pairs of candies in `candy_array` such that the sum of their modulo `k` values is equal to `k`. For each candy, it uses a dictionary to track the occurrences of modulo values, updating the count of pairs found and returning the total count as `res`, which is printed but not returned from the function. If `candy_array` is empty, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.
