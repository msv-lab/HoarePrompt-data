According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path`. The loop is structured to iterate over pairs `(x, y)` in `ret_path`. Since `ret_path` has at least 2 elements, it can provide at least one pair for the loop to execute. 

However, the state of `x` and `y` at the start of the loop should be initialized based on the first pair in `ret_path`. Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to state that `x` is the first element and `y` is the second element of the first pair in `ret_path`.

State: **`ret_path` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the first element of the first pair in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the first pair in `ret_path`**
