According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and the range specified by `n`. Since `ind` starts at 0 and iterates through values less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented to its next value, which will be 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0 and `n` is between 1 and 8. For the loop to run again, `ind` should be 1, as long as `n` is greater than 1. `n` can remain between 1 and 8, but to ensure the loop executes again, it is sufficient to state that `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`s` is an empty list, `n` is between 2 and 8, `i` is 0, `ind` is 1, and `ok` remains unchanged**
