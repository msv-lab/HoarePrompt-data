Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's, with the first character being '1', `ok` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8, `ret_gp` is updated by appending the result of `func_2(s)` if `s2[2]` is '0'. If `i` is 2 and `s` is [2], the program checks the conditions based on the binary representation of `i` against the string `s2`, ensuring that for each bit position indicated by `ind`, if the bit is 0, the corresponding position in `s2` satisfies the condition of being '1'.***
