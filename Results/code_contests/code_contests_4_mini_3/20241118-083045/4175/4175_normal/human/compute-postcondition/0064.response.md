According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path`. If `ret_path` contains at least one more pair, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` contains at least one more pair, which means there are still pairs left for the loop to process. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ret_path` should contain at least one more pair, and the next values of `x` and `y` should reflect the next pair in the `ret_path`.

Assuming that the next pair in `ret_path` is the next available pair after the last printed values of `x` and `y`, we need to adjust for that. However, without specific information about the previous values of `x` and `y` or the structure of `ret_path`, we can only state the requirements generically.

State: **`ret_path` contains at least one more pair, (x, y) is the next pair from ret_path**
