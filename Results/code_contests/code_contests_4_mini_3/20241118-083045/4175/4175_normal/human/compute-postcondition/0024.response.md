The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `ok` is unspecified, but it is stated to remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ok` is False, `ret_gp` is updated by appending the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` shifted right by `ind` is even, and the element at index `i + 2`.
