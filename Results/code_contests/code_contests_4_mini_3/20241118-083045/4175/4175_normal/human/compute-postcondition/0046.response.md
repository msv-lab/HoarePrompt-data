The value of `ok` is assigned `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged: `s` is an empty list, `n` is between 3 and 8, `i` is 0, and `ind` is 2. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an empty list, `n` is between 3 and 8, `i` is 0, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`s` is an empty list, `n` is between 3 and 8, `i` is 0, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False**
