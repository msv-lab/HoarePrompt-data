The `print` statement will output the string 'Impossible' to the console. The values of all other variables remain unchanged, as the `print` function does not modify any state. Therefore, the output state is: `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by the result of `func_4` applied to each element in `ret_gp`, which is empty; `ret_gp` remains empty; `ok` is set to False; `n` is between 1 and 8; `s1` is unchanged; and `s2` remains unchanged, and the function prints 'Impossible'.
