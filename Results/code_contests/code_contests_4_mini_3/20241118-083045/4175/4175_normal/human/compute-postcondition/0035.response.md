Postcondition: ***`s` is a list containing the integer 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8, `i` is 1, and `ok` remains unchanged. If `s2[i]` is '0' and `n` is at least 1, `ret_gp` is updated by appending the result of `func_2(s)`, while `ok` may be set to False if there are indices in the range of `n` such that `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1'. If `n` is 0 or less, `ret_gp` remains unchanged.***
