The code prints the length of `ret_path` minus 1. The initial state indicates that `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by the results of `func_4` applied to each element in `ret_gp`. The exact number of elements in `ret_gp` is unknown, so the length of `ret_path` may vary. However, since `ret_path` starts with (0, 0), it has at least 2 elements. 

To determine the output state, we need to express the output based on the current values of `ret_path`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the length of `ret_path`, which is at least 2, and thus `len(ret_path) - 1` will be at least 1.

Output State: **`ret_path` has at least 2 elements; the printed output is at least 1**
