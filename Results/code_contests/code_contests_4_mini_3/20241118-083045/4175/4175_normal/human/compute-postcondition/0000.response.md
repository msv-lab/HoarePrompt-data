The variable `ok` is assigned the value `True`, and this assignment does not affect any other variables (`s1` and `s2` remain unchanged). Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's, with the first character being '1'; `ok` is True.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's, with the first character being '1'; `ok` is True**.
