Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with the first character being '1', `ok` is set to False if the value of `i` right-shifted by `ind` is even, and the character at position `i + 2^ind` in `s2` is '1'. Otherwise, `ok` remains True. The values of `n`, `ret_gp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged, with `n` between 1 and 8, `ret_gp` as an empty list, `i` equal to 2, and `s` equal to [2].***
