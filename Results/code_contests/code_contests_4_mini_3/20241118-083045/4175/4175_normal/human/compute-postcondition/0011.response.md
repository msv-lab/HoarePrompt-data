The value of `ok` is set to `False`, which is already its value. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state is `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with the first character being '1', `ok` is False, `n` remains unchanged, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `s` is [2].
