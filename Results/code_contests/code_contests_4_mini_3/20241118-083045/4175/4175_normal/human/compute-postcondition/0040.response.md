The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `s`, `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged, as there are no operations affecting them in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the new value of `ok`.

Output State: **`s` is an empty list, `n` is between 1 and 8, `i` is 0, `ind` is 0, `ok` is False**
