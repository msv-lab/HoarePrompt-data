Output State: **The loop iterates over pairs in `ret_path`, printing each pair's elements as strings concatenated with a space. If `ret_path` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes for each pair present. If `ret_path` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and no pairs are printed. In such a case, `x` and `y` are undefined, and no output is generated.**
