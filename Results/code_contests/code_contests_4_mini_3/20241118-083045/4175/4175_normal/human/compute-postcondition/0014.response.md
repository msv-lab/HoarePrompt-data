The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 8), `ret_gp` is an empty list, `ind` is 2, `s` is [2], and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 8), `ret_gp` is an empty list, `ind` is 2, `s` is [2], and `ok` is False**
