According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have: 
- `s` is [1],
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `i` is 1, 
- `ind` is 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it allows for `ind` to take the value of 2. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `ind` needs to be updated to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `ind` is 2**
