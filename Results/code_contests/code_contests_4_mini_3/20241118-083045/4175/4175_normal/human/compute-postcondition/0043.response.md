The value of `ok` is assigned `False`, but since it is marked as unchanged in the initial state, we assume it retains its previous value. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, and `ind`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `s` is an empty list, `n` is between 2 and 8, `i` is 0, `ind` is 1, and `ok` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an empty list, `n` is between 2 and 8, `i` is 0, `ind` is 1, and `ok` remains unchanged**
