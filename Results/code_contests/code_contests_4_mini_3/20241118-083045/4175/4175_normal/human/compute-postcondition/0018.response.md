The function `func_2(s)` is called with `s` as the argument. The variable `ret_gp` is updated by appending the result of `func_2(s)`. The previous values of the other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 8, `ret_gp` is the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is 2, `s` is [2], and `ok` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 8, `ret_gp` is the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is 2, `s` is [2], and `ok` remains unchanged**.
