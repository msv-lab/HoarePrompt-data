The code prints the string representation of the variables `x` and `y`, which are respectively the first and second elements of the first pair in `ret_path`. The values of `x` and `y` are not altered by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `x` and `y` as they are prior to the execution of the print statement.

Output State: **`ret_path` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the first element of the first pair in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the first pair in `ret_path`, and the function prints str(x) + ' ' + str(y)**
