The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `s`, `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ok` is False, and `ind` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ok` is False, `ind` is 1**
