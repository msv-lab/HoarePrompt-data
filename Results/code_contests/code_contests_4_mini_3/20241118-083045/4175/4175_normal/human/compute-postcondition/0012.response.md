Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with the first character being '1', `ok` is set to False if the value of `i` right-shifted by `n-1` is even and the character at position `i + 2^(n-1)` in `s2` is '1'; otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged. `n` remains unchanged, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `s` is [2].***
