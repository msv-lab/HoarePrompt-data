According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `ind` to 3, which means that `n` must be at least 4 to ensure that the loop will have room for another iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 1, and `ind` is 3**
