Postcondition: ***`s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `ok` remains unchanged, but if the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False, and `ret_gp` is updated by appending the result of `func_2(s)`. This implies that if `i` shifted right by `ind` is even and the specified element in `s2` is '1', the boolean variable `ok` changes to False, while other variables remain unchanged.***
