The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False**
