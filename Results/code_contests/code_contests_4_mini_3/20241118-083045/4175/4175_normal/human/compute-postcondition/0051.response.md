Postcondition: ***`s` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8, and `i` is 0. If `s2[i]` is '0', then for each `ind` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `ok` remains unchanged, and `ret_gp` is increased by the return value of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is not '0', no changes occur to `ok`, `ret_gp`, or any other variables.***
