According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, and since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 8, it ensures that the loop will indeed execute. The variable `ind` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Before the loop starts, `s` is an empty list, which does not affect the execution of the loop. The value of `i` is 0, which is a valid initial state. The variable `ok` remains unchanged, and it does not impact the loop execution either.

Thus, for the loop to be executed correctly, the states should reflect that `ind` is 0 at the start of the loop and that `n` is within the specified range.

State: **`s` is an empty list, `n` is between 1 and 8, `i` is 0, `ind` is 0, `ok` remains unchanged**
