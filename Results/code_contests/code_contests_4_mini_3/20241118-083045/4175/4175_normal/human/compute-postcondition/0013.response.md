According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` remains unchanged. Since `s1` represents a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), the value of `n` must be between 1 and 8. Since `ind` starts at 0 and goes up to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is equal to the current iteration index. To allow for one more execution, `ind` must be incremented by 1. If `n` is 2 (which is the maximum value for `ind` to be less than `n`), then we can determine that `ind` must be 2.

Hence, to execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `ind` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. 

State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 8), ret_gp is an empty list, ind is 2, s is [2]**
