Postcondition: ***If `ok` is True, the function prints 'Possible', the length of `ret_path` minus one, and iterates over each pair in `ret_path` to print their elements as strings concatenated with a space. If `ret_path` has fewer than 2 elements, no pairs are printed. If `ok` is False, the function prints 'Impossible', `ret_path` remains a list starting with (0, 0) followed by the result of `func_4` applied to each element in `ret_gp`, which is empty; `ret_gp` remains empty, `n` is between 1 and 8, `s1` is unchanged, and `s2` remains unchanged. The variable `ok` is set to False if conditions fail, ensuring that the output reflects the success or failure of the operation based on the state of `ok`.***
