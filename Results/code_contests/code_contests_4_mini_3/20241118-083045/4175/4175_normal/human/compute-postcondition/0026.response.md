According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and the value of `n`. The loop runs for `ind` in the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 so that `ind` can take the value 1 in the next iteration. 

Thus, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2, and `ind` should be set to 1 for the next iteration. The other states (`s`, `i`, and `ok`) remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is [1], `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `ok` remains unchanged, `ind` is 1**
