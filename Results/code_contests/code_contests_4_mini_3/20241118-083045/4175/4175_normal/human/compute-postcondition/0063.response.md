The code prints the values of `x` and `y` as strings, concatenated with a space in between. Since `ret_path` is mentioned to contain at least one more pair, it does not affect the calculation but indicates that there are pairs available. However, the values of `x` and `y` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is based solely on the action of printing the values.

Output State: **`ret_path` contains at least one more pair, and the function prints the values of `x` and `y` as strings concatenated with a space**.
