Output State: **`ok` remains unchanged if `n` is 0 or less; if `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, checking the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and the corresponding value in `s2` at index `i + 2 ** ind`. If both conditions are true during any iteration, `ok` is set to `False`. After the loop, `s` is [1], `n` is an integer between 1 and 8, `i` is 1, and `ind` will range from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `ok` remains unchanged.**
