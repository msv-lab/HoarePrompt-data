Output State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by the result of `func_4` applied to each element in `ret_gp`, which may be empty; `ret_gp` may be updated multiple times based on the values of `s2`, `s` will be a list of indices where bits are '1', `ok` may be set to False if conditions fail, `n` is between 1 and 8, and if `s2` has '1's at positions `i`, no changes occur for that iteration; if `n` is 0 or `s2` does not have the expected length, the loop does not execute and `ret_gp` remains empty, `ok` remains True, `s1` is unchanged, and `s2` remains unchanged.**
