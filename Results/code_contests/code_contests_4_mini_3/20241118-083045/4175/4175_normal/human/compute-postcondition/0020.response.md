According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since the loop is decrementing `i` from `2 ** n - 1` to `0`, it can execute one more time if `i` is decremented to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables (`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, `ret_gp`, and `s`) do not affect the loop's execution criteria.

State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's, with the first character being '1', `ok` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8, `ret_gp` is updated by appending the result of `func_2(s) if s2[2]` is '0', `i` is 1**
