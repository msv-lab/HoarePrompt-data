The function prints the concatenated string of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the first element of the second pair in `ret_path`, and `y` is the second element of the second pair in `ret_path`. The values of `x` and `y` are derived from `ret_path`, but the specific values are not given. Therefore, the output state reflects that the function prints the string representation of `x` and `y` separated by a space.

Output State: **The function prints str(x) + ' ' + str(y)**
