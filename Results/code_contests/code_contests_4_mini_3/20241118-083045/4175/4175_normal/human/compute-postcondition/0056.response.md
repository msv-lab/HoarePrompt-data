The code prints the string 'Possible'. The values of the other variables (`ret_path`, `ret_gp`, `s`, `ok`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`) remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects that the message has been printed while the variable states remain as described.

Output State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by the result of `func_4` applied to each element in `ret_gp`, which may be empty; `ret_gp` may be updated multiple times based on the values of `s2`, `s` will be a list of indices where bits are '1', `ok` is True, `n` is between 1 and 8, `s1` is unchanged, and `s2` remains unchanged.**
