The variable `ret_gp` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables (`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not impacted by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the initialization of `ret_gp` and the existing states of the other variables.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8); `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's, with the first character being '1'; `ok` is True; `n` is an integer between 1 and 8; `ret_gp` is an empty list**
