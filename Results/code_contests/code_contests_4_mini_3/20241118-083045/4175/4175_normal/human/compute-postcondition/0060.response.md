According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path` list. If `ret_path` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the first element of the first pair in `ret_path`, and `y` is the second element of the first pair in `ret_path`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ret_path` must have at least one more pair. This means that after the last execution, `ret_path` should have at least 3 elements, and the next pair `x` and `y` must be the first element of the second pair in `ret_path` and the second element of the second pair in `ret_path`, respectively.

State: **`ret_path` has at least 3 elements, `x` is the first element of the second pair in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the second pair in `ret_path`, and the function prints str(x) + ' ' + str(y)**
