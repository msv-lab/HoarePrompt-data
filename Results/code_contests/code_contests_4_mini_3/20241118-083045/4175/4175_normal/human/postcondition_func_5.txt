The function accepts two parameters: a string `s1` representing a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) and a string `s2` of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's, with the first character being '1'. It processes the bits of `s2` to determine a set of indices and constructs a list of paths based on these indices. If certain conditions regarding `s2` are met, it outputs 'Possible' and prints the length of the path followed by the pairs in the path; otherwise, it outputs 'Impossible'. If `s2` does not meet the conditions, or if `n` is 0, the function may not execute properly, and `ret_gp` could remain empty without generating any meaningful output.
