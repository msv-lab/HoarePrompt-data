The function accepts a string `s` and recursively constructs a list. If `s` is empty (after removing its last character), it returns a list containing the last character. Otherwise, it returns a list that includes the result of recursively calling itself with the string excluding the last character, the last character itself, the result of calling another function `func_1` with the result of the recursive call, and the negative of the last character. The function expects `s` to have at least one character to avoid errors.
