The function accepts an integer `v`. If `v` is greater than 0, it returns a list of tuples structured as [(1, 0), (2, 0), ..., (v, 1), (v - 1, 1), ..., (1, 0)]. If `v` is less than 0, it returns the reversed list of tuples obtained by applying the function to the positive value of `v`. If `v` is 0, the function does not return anything and effectively does nothing.
