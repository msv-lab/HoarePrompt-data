The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `ok` is not specified, but it is being set to `False` now. The other variables `s1`, `s2`, `i`, `ind`, and `n` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `ok` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`, `ok` is False, `i` is 1, `ind` is 0, `n` is derived from `s1` and is greater than 0.**
