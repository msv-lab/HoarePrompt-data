According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ret_path`. The loop iterates over pairs in `ret_path`, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the loop has executed for the first two pairs in `ret_path`. 

Given that `ret_path` has at least 1 element, for the loop to execute one more time, `ret_path` must have at least 3 elements so that there is a third pair for the loop to process. Additionally, after the last iteration, `x` is currently the first element of the first pair, and `y` is the second element of that pair. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to indicate the next pair, which means `i` should be 3. The next values of `x` and `y` will need to correspond to the third pair in the list.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `ret_path` has at least 3 elements,
- `i` is 3,
- `x` is the first element of the third pair in `ret_path`,
- `y` is the second element of the third pair in `ret_path`.

State: **`ok` is True, `i` is 3, `ret_path` has at least 3 elements, `x` is the first element of the third pair in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the third pair in `ret_path`, and the output is 'x y' where 'x' and 'y' are their respective values.**
