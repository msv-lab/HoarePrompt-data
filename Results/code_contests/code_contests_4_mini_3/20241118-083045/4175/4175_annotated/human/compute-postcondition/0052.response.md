To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. The loop iterates with `i` starting from `2 ** n - 1` and decrements down to `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be greater than or equal to `0`.

2. We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be equal to `0` for the loop to terminate on the next check. Since `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, if it was `0` at the end of the last iteration, it will not execute again.

3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to `1`. Also, we need to ensure that `n` is such that the range is valid. 

4. The value of `n` must remain within the bounds defined (1 <= N <= 8). 

From the analysis, we can summarize the adjustments:
- Set `i` to `1` to allow the loop to execute again.
- `n` remains unchanged as it still satisfies the condition.

So, the adjusted state needs to reflect that `i` is now `1`.

State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`, `i` is 1**
