Output State: **`ok` is set to False if, for any `ind` in the range `n`, the condition `((i >> ind) % 2 == 0)` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1'. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `ok` remains True. If `i + 2^ind` exceeds the length of `s2`, it may cause an index error which is not handled. Therefore, if `n` is 0, `ok` is True; otherwise, `ok` can be False based on the conditions checked in the loop.**
