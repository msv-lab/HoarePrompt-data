The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than or equal to 2, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`, `i` is 1, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False.
