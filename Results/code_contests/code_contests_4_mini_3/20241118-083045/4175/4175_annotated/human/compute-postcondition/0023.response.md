Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is a boolean, `i` is 2, `ind` is 0, `n` is at least 1. The value of `i` right-shifted by `ind` is even, and the character at position `i + 2^ind` in `s2` is '1'.***
