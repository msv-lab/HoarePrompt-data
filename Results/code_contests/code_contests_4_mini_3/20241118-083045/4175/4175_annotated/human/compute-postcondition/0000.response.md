The variable `ok` is assigned the value `True`. The initial states of `s1` and `s2` are not affected by this assignment, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', and `ok` is True.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', and `ok` is True**
