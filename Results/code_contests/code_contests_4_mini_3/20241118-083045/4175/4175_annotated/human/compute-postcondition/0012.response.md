Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is set to False, and `ind` is the next value in the range (the previous value of `ind` + 1). If the bit at position `ind` of `i` is 0 and the character at position `i + 2^ind` in `s2` is '1', then `ok` remains False.***
