The code prints 'Impossible', and this does not change the values of any variables. The previous state of the variables remains the same, with `ret_gp` containing cumulative results, `ok` being `False`, and `i` ranging from `2`. Therefore, the output state is `ret_gp` contains cumulative results of `func_2(s)`, `ok` is `False`, `i` ranges from `2`, and we print 'Impossible'.

Output State: **`ret_gp` contains cumulative results of `func_2(s)`, `ok` is `False`, `i` ranges from `2`, and we print 'Impossible'**
