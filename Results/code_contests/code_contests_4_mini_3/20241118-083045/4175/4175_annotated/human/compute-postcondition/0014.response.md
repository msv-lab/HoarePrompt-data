The code assigns `False` to the variable `ok`, but `ok` is already set to `False`, so there is no change in its value. The other variables `s1`, `s2`, and `ind` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged initial state.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is False, and `ind` is less than N**
