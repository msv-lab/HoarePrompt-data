The value of `ok` is assigned the value `False`, which means there is no change to its previous state since it was already `False`. The other variables (`s1`, `s2`, and `ind`) are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same for those variables.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is False, and `ind` is the next value in the range (the previous value of `ind` + 1)**
