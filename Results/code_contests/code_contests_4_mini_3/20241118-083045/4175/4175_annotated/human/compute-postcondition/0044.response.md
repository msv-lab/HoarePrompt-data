Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'`, then `ok` is set to False. If either of these conditions is not met, the value of `ok` remains unchanged. This captures the scenario where the specific bit manipulation and string indexing conditions are checked against the values of `s2` while ensuring that `ok` only changes under specified circumstances.***
