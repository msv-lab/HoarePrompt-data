Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`, `ok` is a boolean, `i` is 1, `ind` is 0, `n` is derived from `s1` and is greater than 0. The value of `i` shifted right by `ind` is even, and the character at index `i + 2^ind` of `s2` is '1'.***
