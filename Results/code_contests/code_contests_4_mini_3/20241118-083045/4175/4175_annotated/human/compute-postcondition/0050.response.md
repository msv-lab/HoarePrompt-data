The code updates the value of `ret_gp` by adding the result of `func_2(s)` to it. However, the initial state mentions the variable `ok` and its conditions, which do not seem to directly influence the calculation of `ret_gp`. Since `n` is 1 or less, or the loop conditions are not met, `ok` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ret_gp` has been updated based on the value returned by `func_2(s)`, while `ok` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ok` remains unchanged, `ret_gp` is updated by adding the result of `func_2(s)`**
