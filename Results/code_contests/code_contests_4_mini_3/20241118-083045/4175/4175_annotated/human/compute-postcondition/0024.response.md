The value of `ok` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value. All other variables remain unaffected in this operation. The output state reflects the updated value of `ok`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is False, `i` is 2, `ind` is 0, `n` is at least 1.**
