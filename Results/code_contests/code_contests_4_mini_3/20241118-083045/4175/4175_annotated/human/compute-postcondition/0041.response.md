Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8) and `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`. If `i` is 1, `ind` is 0, and the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true while `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` equals '1', then `ok` is set to False. If the condition is not met, `ok` remains unchanged.***
