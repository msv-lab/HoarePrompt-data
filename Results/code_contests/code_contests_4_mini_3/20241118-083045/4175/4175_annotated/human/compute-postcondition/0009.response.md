Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is set to False if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0) holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1'. In all other cases, `ok` remains True. The values of `n`, `ret_gp`, `ind`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the character at index `i` of `s2` is '0'.***
