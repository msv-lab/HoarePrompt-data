The code prints the value of `len(ret_path) - 1`. The variable `ret_path` is updated to include new tuples generated by `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`. The exact length of `ret_path` is unknown from the previous state. Therefore, the output state is that `ok` is `True`, `i` ranges from `2`, and the output is 'Possible', while the length of `ret_path` is unknown.

Output State: **`ok` is True, `i` ranges from 2, the output is 'Possible', and the length of `ret_path` is unknown**
