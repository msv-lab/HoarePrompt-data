Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`, `ok` is a boolean, and `i` is 2. If `s2[i]` is '0', then `ok` remains unchanged and `ret_gp` is increased by the result of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is not '0', the body of the if statement is not executed, and `ret_gp` remains unchanged. Additionally, the operation evaluates all conditions in the loop to potentially set `ok` to False based on the values of `s2`.***
