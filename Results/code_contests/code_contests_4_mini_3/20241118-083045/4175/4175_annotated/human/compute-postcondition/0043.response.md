The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The initial values of the other variables (`s1`, `s2`, `i`, `ind`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `ok`. 

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, and `ok` is False**
