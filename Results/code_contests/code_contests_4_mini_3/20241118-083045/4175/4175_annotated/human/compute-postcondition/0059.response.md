The code prints the values of `x` and `y` as strings, concatenated with a space in between. The values of `x` and `y` are derived from the initial state: `x` is the first element of `ret_path` and `y` is the second element of the first pair in `ret_path`. The printing operation does not change the state of any variables.

Output State: **`ok` is True, `i` is 2, `ret_path` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the first pair in `ret_path`, and the output is 'x y' where 'x' and 'y' are their respective values.**
