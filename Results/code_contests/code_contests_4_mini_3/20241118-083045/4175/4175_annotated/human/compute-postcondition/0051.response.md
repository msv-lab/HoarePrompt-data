Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8) and `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`. If `s2[1]` is '0', then `ok` remains unchanged, and `ret_gp` is updated by adding the result of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[1]` is '1', the conditions inside the for loop are not executed, and again `ok` remains unchanged while `ret_gp` is updated by adding the result of `func_2(s)`.
