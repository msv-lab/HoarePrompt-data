The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ind` is equal to n, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ind` is equal to n, and `ok` is False**
