According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path`. For the loop to execute, `ret_path` must contain at least one pair of values (x, y). The current state indicates that `ok` is `True`, but does not provide information about `ret_path`. Therefore, we need to specify that `ret_path` should have at least one element. Additionally, since `(x, y)` will take the first pair from `ret_path` during the first iteration, we can assume that `x` and `y` will be initialized to the first values in `ret_path`.

State: **`ok` is True, `i` is 2, `ret_path` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the first pair in `ret_path`**
