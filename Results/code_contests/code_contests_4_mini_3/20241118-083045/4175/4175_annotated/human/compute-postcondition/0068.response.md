Postcondition: ***`ret_gp` contains the cumulative results of `func_2(s)` for all indices `i` where `s2[i]` is '0', `ok` is a boolean indicating if all conditions were met, and `i` counts from 2 upwards. If `ok` is True, the program prints 'Possible', the length of `ret_path` minus 1, and for each tuple `(x, y)` in `ret_path`, it prints the string representation of `x` and `y`. If `ret_path` is empty, it indicates `ok` is still True with `i` being 2, and no values for `x` and `y` are printed. If `ok` is False, the output will be 'Impossible', reflecting that some conditions were not satisfied.***
