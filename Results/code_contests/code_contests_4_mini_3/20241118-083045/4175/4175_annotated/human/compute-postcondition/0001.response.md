The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(s1)`, where `s1` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 8. The value of `n` will therefore be an integer between 1 and 8. The values of the other variables (`s2` and `ok`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is True, and `n` is the integer value of `s1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is True, `n` is the integer value of `s1`**
