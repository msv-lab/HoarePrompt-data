Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is set to False if `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1'; otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `ind` are 2 and 0 respectively, and `n` is at least 1.***
