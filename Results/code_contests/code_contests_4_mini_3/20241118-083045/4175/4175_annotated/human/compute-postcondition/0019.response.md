Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is a boolean that is set to False if for any `ind` in the range `n`, the condition `((i >> ind) % 2 == 0)` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` equals '1'. The list `ret_gp` is increased by the result of `func_2(s)` regardless of the condition. If `s2[i]` is '1', these operations are skipped.***
