Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with `s2[0] = '1'`, `ok` remains False if the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', otherwise the value of `ok` is unchanged. The variable `ind` is less than N.***
