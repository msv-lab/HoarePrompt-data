Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', and `ind` is equal to `n`. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, `ok` retains its previous value.***
