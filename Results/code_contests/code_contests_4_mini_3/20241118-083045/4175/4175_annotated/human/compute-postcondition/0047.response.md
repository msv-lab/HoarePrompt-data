Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than or equal to 2, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where `s2[0] = '1'`, `i` is 1, and `ind` is 2. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` is true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'`, then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
