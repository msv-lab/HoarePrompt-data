Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8), `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is True, `n` is an integer value of `s1`, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `ind` is 0, `s` is [2], the character at index `i` of `s2` is '0', `i` is such that ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0) is true, and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1'.***
