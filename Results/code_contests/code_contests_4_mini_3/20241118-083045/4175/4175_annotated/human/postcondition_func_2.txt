The function accepts an integer `v` and returns a list of tuples based on the value of `v`: if `v` is a positive integer, it generates a list containing tuples (i, 0) for i from 1 to `v`, followed by the tuples (v, 1) and (v - 1, 1), and then tuples (i, 0) for i from `v - 1` down to 1. If `v` is a negative integer, it returns the reversed list of tuples generated by applying the function to the positive value of `v`. If `v` is zero, the function does not return any output, leading to an undefined return value.
