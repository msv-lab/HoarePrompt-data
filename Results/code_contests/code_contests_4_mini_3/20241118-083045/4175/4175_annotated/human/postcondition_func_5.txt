The function accepts a string `s1` representing a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8) and a string `s2` of length `2^N` containing '0's and '1's. It evaluates conditions based on the binary representation of indices and outputs 'Possible' with associated results or 'Impossible' if conditions are not met. It may not handle invalid configurations in `s2` appropriately, leading to cases where no output is produced despite valid input.
