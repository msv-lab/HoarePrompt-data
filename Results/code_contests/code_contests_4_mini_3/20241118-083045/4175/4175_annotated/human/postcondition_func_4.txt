The function `func_5` calls `func_6` with two string arguments, '1' and '11'. The provided annotations suggest that the function expects a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8) and a string A of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', with A[0] = '1'. However, the actual code does not take any parameters or validate these expectations, nor does it process any input beyond the hardcoded strings. Therefore, it does not implement any logic to handle the described conditions or constraints.
