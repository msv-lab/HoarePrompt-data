Output State: **`visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a list that may be empty or contain neighbors. If `grafo[no[0]]` is empty, the loop does not execute and `visitados` remains unchanged. If `grafo[no[0]]` has neighbors, for each `vizinho`, if `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, `func_1` is called with `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, `func_1` is not called, and the state of `visitados` remains unchanged for that `vizinho`. After the loop, `visitados` has the same state as before if no new unvisited neighbors were found.**
