Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. `grafo` is a list of lists containing tuples representing connected districts and road types. `visitados` is a list of boolean values of size `n` initialized to False. If `no[1]` is True, then `cand['value']` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `no[0]`. If `no[1]` is False, `cand['value']` remains unchanged. Thus, `cand['value']` will either be the maximum value between its previous state and `no[0]` if `no[1]` is True, or retain its original value if `no[1]` is False.***
