The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The state of `visitados[no[0]]` is True, indicating that the node is marked as visited. The variable `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 3 elements, and `vizinho` is assigned the third element in that list.

The execution of the function does not change the values of the variables in the current context but may affect the states within the scope of `func_1`. Thus, we acknowledge that the function is invoked with specific parameters while the states of `visitados`, `grafo`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 3 elements, `vizinho` is the third element in `grafo[no[0]]`, and func_1 is called with the parameters (vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand)**
