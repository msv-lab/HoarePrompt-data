The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The state of the variables that are passed to the function will be evaluated based on the initial state provided. 

- `visitados[no[0]]` is `True`, indicating that the node at index `no[0]` has already been visited.
- `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, which means there are neighboring nodes to consider.
- `vizinho` is the first element in `grafo[no[0]]`, representing a neighboring node.
- `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is `False`, indicating that this neighboring node has not been visited yet.

The function call does not change any of the variables in the current state; it merely initiates a new process with the provided parameters. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the values of `visitados`, `grafo`, and `vizinho`.

Output State: **`visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, `vizinho` is the first element in `grafo[no[0]]`, and `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False**
