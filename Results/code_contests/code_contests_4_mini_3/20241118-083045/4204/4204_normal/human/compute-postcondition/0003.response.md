The line of code `visitados[no[0]] = True` updates the `visitados` list at the index `no[0]` to `True`. The previous state of `visitados` indicates which districts have been visited, and this operation marks the district at index `no[0]` as visited. The values of the other variables, including `cand['value']`, remain unchanged by this operation.

Assuming `no[0]` is a valid index within the bounds of `visitados`, the output state reflects that the district at index `no[0]` has now been visited.

Output State: **`visitados[no[0]]` is True**
