The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The initial state indicates that `visitados[no[0]]` is `True`, which likely represents that the first node has been visited. The variable `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 2 elements, and `vizinho` is assigned the value of the second element from `grafo[no[0]]`. 

The state of the variables `visitados`, `grafo`, `depth`, and `cand` is not altered by the call to `func_1`, but it does invoke a function that presumably performs further operations based on the provided arguments. 

Since the function call does not return a value or modify the existing variables in this context, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the initial state.

Output State: **`visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 2 elements, `vizinho` is the second element in `grafo[no[0]]`, and the function `func_1` is called with the specified arguments.**
