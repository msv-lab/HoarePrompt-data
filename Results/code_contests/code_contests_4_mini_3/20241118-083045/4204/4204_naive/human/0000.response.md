To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum subset of candidates such that all problem roads (roads with type `2`) are repaired if the candidates are elected. Each candidate represents a district, and if a candidate is elected, they will repair all problem roads on the path from their district to district `1`. 

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The code reads an integer `n` for the number of districts and then reads `n-1` lines to construct a graph of the districts, where each road is marked as a problem road or not.
   
2. **Graph Construction:**
   - A graph is constructed as an adjacency list, indicating which districts are connected by roads and their types.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - The function `func_1` is called to traverse the graph starting from the neighbors of district `1`. During the traversal, it checks if a road is a problem road and keeps track of the maximum candidate (district number) that is connected through problem roads.

4. **Candidate Collection:**
   - The candidates that can repair problem roads are collected in a list `candi`. The program then prints the size of this list and the unique candidates.

### Potential Issues:
- **Candidate Selection Logic:** 
  - The logic used to determine which candidates are added to the `candi` list seems to depend on a depth-first exploration. If a road is a problem road, it checks if that path leads back to the district `1`. However, if there are multiple problem roads leading to the same district, it does not ensure that the minimal number of candidates is chosen. 
  - For example, if there are multiple paths leading to district `1` that are all problem roads, the program may incorrectly select multiple candidates instead of the minimum required.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
5
1 2 2
1 3 2
3 4 2
3 5 2
```
In this case, both candidates `2` and `3` are connected directly to district `1` via problem roads. However, if candidate `3` is elected, all problem roads to districts `4` and `5` will also be repaired. The expected output should be `1` candidate (candidate `3`), but the program might incorrectly include both candidates.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to select the minimum set of candidates to cover all problem roads, as it may end up selecting multiple candidates unnecessarily. 

Correctness: **False**.
