Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem. 

In particular, the issue arises from the way the program identifies candidates who can repair all problem roads. The logic used in function `func_1` is flawed because it only considers the first candidate found on the path from each district to the city Parliament (district 1). It does not ensure that all problem roads on the path are covered by the selected candidates. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 2 2
2 3 1
2 4 2
4 5 1
```

In this case:

- Road (1, 2) is a problem road.
- Road (2, 3) is not a problem road.
- Road (2, 4) is a problem road.
- Road (4, 5) is not a problem road.

The correct output would require candidates 2 and 4 to be elected to ensure all problem roads are repaired. However, the program is likely to miss candidate 2 because it does not correctly track all candidates that cover problem roads on the paths from other districts to district 1.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
