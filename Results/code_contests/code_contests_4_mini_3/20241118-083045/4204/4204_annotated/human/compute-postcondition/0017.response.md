Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `no` representing a node, a graph `grafo` represented as an adjacency list, a list `visitados` to track visited nodes, an integer `depth` indicating the current depth of traversal, and a dictionary `cand` to store a candidate value. It updates `cand['value']` to the maximum of its current value and `no[0]` if `no[1]` is true. The function marks the node `no[0]` as visited and recursively visits all unvisited neighbors in the graph, but does not return any value. If all neighbors are already visited or if `grafo[no[0]]` is empty, no further changes occur. The function does not handle cases where `no` is not in the expected format or where `grafo` does not have the expected structure.**
