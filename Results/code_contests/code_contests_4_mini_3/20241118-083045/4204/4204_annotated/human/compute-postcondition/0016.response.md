The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:  
- `no`: an integer representing a node in the tree.  
- `grafo`: a representation of the tree structure, likely a list or dictionary of edges.  
- `visitados`: a collection (such as a set or list) used to keep track of visited nodes.  
- `depth`: an integer indicating the current depth in the tree traversal.  
- `cand`: a variable that may represent a candidate value related to the problem being solved.

The function processes these parameters and performs operations based on the tree structure defined by `grafo` and the properties of the nodes visited. However, the specific return value is not detailed in the output provided.

Given the information, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters that represent a node, a tree structure, a collection of visited nodes, the current depth of traversal, and a candidate value. The specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
