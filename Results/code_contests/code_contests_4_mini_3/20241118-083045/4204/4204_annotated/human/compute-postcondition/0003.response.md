In the provided code snippet, the statement `visitados[no[0]] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `no[0]` of the list (or array) `visitados`. The previous value of `visitados[no[0]]` is not specified, but it will now be set to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `cand['value']`, and `no`.

Since the condition regarding `no[1]` does not affect the current code line, it does not have an impact on this output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `cand['value']` is unchanged; `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True**
