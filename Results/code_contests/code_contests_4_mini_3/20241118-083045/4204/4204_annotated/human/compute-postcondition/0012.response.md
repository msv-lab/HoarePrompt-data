Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `cand['value']` is unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` contains at least three neighbors, `vizinho` is the third neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`, and the function `func_1` is called with parameters (`vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, `cand`).**
