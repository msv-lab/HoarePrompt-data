Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `cand['value']` is unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True. If `grafo[no[0]]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no changes occur to `visitados`. If `grafo[no[0]]` contains neighbors, `vizinho` will be each neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]` in sequence. For each `vizinho`, if `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, no changes occur to the state of `visitados`, and `func_1` is not called. Additionally, if all neighbors are already visited, `func_1` will not be called at all.**
