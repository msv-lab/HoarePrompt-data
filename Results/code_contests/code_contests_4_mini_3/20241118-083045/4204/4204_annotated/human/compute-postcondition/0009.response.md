The function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The initial state indicates that `n` is within the range 2 to 100,000, `cand['value']` remains unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, and `grafo[no[0]]` contains at least two neighbors, with `vizinho` being the second neighbor of `grafo[no[0]]`. 

The call to `func_1` does not change the state of the variables directly, but it signifies that the function is being executed with the given parameters. The state of the variables is maintained as per the initial state, and the function call may lead to further changes depending on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided here.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `cand['value']` is unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` contains at least two neighbors, `vizinho` is the second neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`, and `func_1` is called with the specified parameters.**
