Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `cand['value']` is unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` contains at least one neighbor, and `vizinho` is the first neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, then `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, there is no change to the state of the program.***
