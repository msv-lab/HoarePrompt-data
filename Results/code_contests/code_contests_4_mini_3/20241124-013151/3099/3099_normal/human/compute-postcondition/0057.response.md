The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is executed. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `query strings`, `plen`, `qlen`, and the output still being 'NO'.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the output is 'NO'**
