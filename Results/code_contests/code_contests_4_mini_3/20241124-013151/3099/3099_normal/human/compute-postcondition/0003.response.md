`plen` is assigned the value of `len(p)`, which calculates the length of the input string `p`. The values of `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, and the query strings remain unchanged, as this line only affects `plen`. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, the query strings remain unchanged, and `plen` is the length of the input string `p`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, the query strings remain unchanged, and `plen` is the length of the input string `p`.**
