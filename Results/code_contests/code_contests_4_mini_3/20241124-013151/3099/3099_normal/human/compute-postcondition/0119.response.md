Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `y` is False if the character at index `i` of `p` is '?' and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the characters at index `i` of `p` and `q` are not equal (with `p[i]` not being '?'). If either condition is met, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If the character at index `i` of `p` is '?' and the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, or if the characters at index `i` of `p` and `q` are equal, `y` remains True and no other changes occur.***
