The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`, which was already its value based on the initial state description. Therefore, there are no changes to any variables, and the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and the output is 'NO'.**
