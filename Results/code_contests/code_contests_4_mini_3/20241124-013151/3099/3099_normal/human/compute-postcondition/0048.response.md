According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `plen`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` must be adjusted to allow for another iteration of the loop.

Since `i` is currently less than `plen`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state for `i` should be `i + 1`. The conditions for `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `query strings`, `plen`, and `qlen` remain unchanged, as they do not affect the loop execution in this scenario.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is incremented by 1**
