The function `func` accepts three parameters: `good_letters`, `pattern`, and `n`. 

- `good_letters` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters.
- `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", with a length from 1 to 10^5.
- `n` is a positive integer that indicates the number of query strings.

Following `n`, the function accepts `n` non-empty query strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters, such that the total length of all query strings does not exceed 10^5.

The function processes the input parameters and returns a result based on matching the query strings against the `pattern`, utilizing the `good_letters`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string of distinct lowercase English letters (`good_letters`), a pattern string (`pattern`), and an integer (`n`), followed by `n` query strings, and then return results based on whether each query string matches the `pattern` under the constraints specified by `good_letters`.
