Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `p1len` is greater than 2. If the character at index `i` in `p1` does not match the character at index `i` in `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If they are equal, there is no change to `y1`, and the program continues execution.***
