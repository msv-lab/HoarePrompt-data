Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is False. This indicates that at least one character at index `i` of `p1` does not match the corresponding character in `qr`, or `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or the loop did not execute due to `p1len` being 0 or `qr` being shorter than `p1`.***
