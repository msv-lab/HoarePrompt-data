According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `p0len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `p0len`, indicating that the loop can execute one more time. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to its current value plus 1.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is equal to its current value plus 1.**
