Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and if `plen` is less than or equal to `qlen`, the loop will execute `plen` times, checking each character of `p` against `q`. If any character at index `i` of `p` is a wildcard `?` and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, it prints 'NO' and sets `y` to False. If any character at index `i` of `p` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, it also prints 'NO' and sets `y` to False. If `plen` exceeds `qlen`, the loop will not execute, and `y` remains True. Additionally, if `p` is empty or if `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute and `y` remains True.**
