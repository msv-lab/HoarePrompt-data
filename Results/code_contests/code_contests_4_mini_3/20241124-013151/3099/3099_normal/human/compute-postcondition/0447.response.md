The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, `p1`, `t`, and the condition regarding `good_letters` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, `p1` retains its initial state, `t` is assigned a value that is a subset of `q`, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, `p1` retains its initial state, `t` is assigned a value that is a subset of `q`, and the function prints 'NO'**
