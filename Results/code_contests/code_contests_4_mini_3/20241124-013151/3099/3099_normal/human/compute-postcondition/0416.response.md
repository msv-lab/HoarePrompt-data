The `print` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, `p1len`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the string 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the string 'NO' is printed**
