Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `y` is True, the output is 'YES', indicating all character conditions were satisfied for the given indices. If `plen` is greater than `qlen`, the output remains 'YES' as no comparisons can be made. If `y` is False at any point during the conditions check, the output will not occur, implying that the conditions were not met satisfactorily.***
