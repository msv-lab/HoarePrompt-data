The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables; rather, it causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. The values of `n`, `q`, and `qlen` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0; `q` is an input string; `qlen` is the length of `q`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `q` is an input string; `qlen` is the length of `q`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
