Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and if the character at index `i` of `pattern` is a '?', then if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop; otherwise, no action is taken and the flow continues. If the character at index `i` of `pattern` is not a '?', the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop if the character at index `i` of `pattern` does not equal the character at index `i` of `q`. The program handles cases where `i` is within bounds and assumes that `plen` is not exceeded during the execution.***
