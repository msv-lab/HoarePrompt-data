The variable `qr` is assigned the value of `q` reversed, which means that `qr` will be a new string that consists of the characters of `q` in reverse order. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the original value of `q` and the newly computed value of `qr`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is True, and `qr` is the reversed string of `q`.**
