Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and if the character at position `i` in `p0` does not match the character at position `i` in `q`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, no changes are made to `y0` or control flow.***
