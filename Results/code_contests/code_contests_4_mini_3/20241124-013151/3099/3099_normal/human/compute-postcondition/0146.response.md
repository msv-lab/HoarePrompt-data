Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes `n` times, processing `n` query strings `q` against the pattern `p`. For each query, if its length `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed. If `qlen` equals `plen`, it checks each character against `p`. If `p[i]` is '?', it checks if `q[i]` is in `good_letters`. If any conditions fail, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False; if all conditions are met, 'YES' is printed. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain unchanged: `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, and `qlen` remain unchanged.**
