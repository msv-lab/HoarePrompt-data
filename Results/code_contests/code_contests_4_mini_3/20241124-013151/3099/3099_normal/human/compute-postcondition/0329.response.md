Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than `i`, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the updated length of `q`. If the character `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `y1` or output.***
