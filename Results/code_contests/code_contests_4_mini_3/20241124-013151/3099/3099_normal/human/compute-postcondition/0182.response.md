Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and if at index `i` (where `i` is less than `p0len`), the character `p0[i]` does not match `q[i]`, then the function prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, further iterations may occur, but this specific condition does not alter the values of `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, `p0`, `p1`, `p0len`, `p1len`, `q`, and `qlen`.***
