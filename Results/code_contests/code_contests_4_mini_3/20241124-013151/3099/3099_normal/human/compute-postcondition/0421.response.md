The variable `y1` is assigned the value of `False`, which means that its value does not change since it remains unchanged in the initial state. The values of the other variables (`y0`, `p1len`, `i`, and the output 'NO') remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'**
