The value of `y` is changed from `True` to `False`. The previous state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark ('?'), and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`; the output is 'NO'.
