The variable `good_letters` is assigned the value of a set created from the characters in `gls`. Since `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `good_letters` will contain each character from `gls` as individual elements in the set. The state of `pattern`, `n`, and the query strings remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates the content of `good_letters` based on the input string `gls`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, and the query strings remain unchanged.**
