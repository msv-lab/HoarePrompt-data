The value of `y1` is changed from `True` to `False`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `y0` remains True or False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed string of `q`, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p1` is '?', and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, and 'NO' is printed.
