Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string of length `qlen`, `p0` is a string of length `p0len`, `y0` is set to False, and 'NO' is printed if the character at index `i` of `p0` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, there is no change in `y0` or any output, and the program continues executing the following code.***
