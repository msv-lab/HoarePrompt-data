Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`. If the character at index `i` in `p` does not match the character at index `i` in `q`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` remains False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
