According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p1len`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `p1len`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `p1len`, which means `p1len` must be adjusted to be greater than `i` (which is equal to `p1len`).

Since `i` has reached its limit (equal to `p1len`), the condition for executing the loop again is not satisfied, so we need to ensure that `p1len` is adjusted to be greater than `i` (i.e., `p1len` must be incremented by at least 1).

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than `i`, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the updated length of `q`.**
