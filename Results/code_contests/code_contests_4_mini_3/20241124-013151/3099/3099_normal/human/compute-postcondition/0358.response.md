Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, the program proceeds without any action stated in this fragment.***
