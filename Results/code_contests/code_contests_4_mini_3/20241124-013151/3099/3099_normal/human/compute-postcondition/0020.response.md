Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False and 'NO' is printed, indicating that the current query character is invalid. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `y` remains True and the program continues executing.***
