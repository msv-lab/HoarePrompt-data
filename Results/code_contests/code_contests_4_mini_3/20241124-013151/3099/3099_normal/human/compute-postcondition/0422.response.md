The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
