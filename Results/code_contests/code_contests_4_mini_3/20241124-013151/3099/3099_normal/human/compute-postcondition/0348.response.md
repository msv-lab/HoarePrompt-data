The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change during this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same, indicating that the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any modifications to the existing variable values.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `y1` is False indicating a mismatch occurred during the checks against the reversed string `qr`, `t` is assigned the value of `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0 or the substring of `q` from index `p0len` to index `-p1len` otherwise, the intersection of the set of characters in `t` with `good_letters` is non-empty, and the output printed is 'NO' and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
