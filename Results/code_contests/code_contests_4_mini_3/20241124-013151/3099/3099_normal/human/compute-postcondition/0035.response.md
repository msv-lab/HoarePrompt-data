The `break` statement does not change any variable values but exits the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. The output state reflects that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is equal to `plen`, the output is 'NO'; `y` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
