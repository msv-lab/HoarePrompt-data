Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of distinct lowercase English letters (`good_letters`), a pattern string (`pattern`) that may include the characters '?' and '*', and a positive integer (`n`), followed by `n` query strings. It checks if each query string matches the pattern according to specific rules: if the pattern does not contain '*', it verifies that the lengths of the query match the pattern and checks characters against `good_letters`. If '*' is present, it verifies the prefix and suffix of the query against the respective parts of the pattern while ensuring that the substring in between does not contain any characters from `good_letters`. The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query string based on these conditions. It does not return any values; instead, it directly prints the results. Edge cases include handling query strings that do not meet the length requirements or contain invalid characters. Additionally, if `n` is 0, no queries are processed and no output is generated.**
