Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, `p1` retains its initial state, and `t` is assigned the value of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end if `p1len` is 0. If `p1len` is greater than 0, `t` is assigned the value of `q` starting from index `p0len` to `-p1len`, effectively slicing off the last `p1len` elements of `q`.***
