Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and if the character at position `i` of `pattern` does not equal the character at position `i` of `q`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
