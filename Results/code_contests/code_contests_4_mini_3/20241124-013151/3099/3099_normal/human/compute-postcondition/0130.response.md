According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `plen`. Given that `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`, the current value of `i` is now greater than its previous value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `plen`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, and `i` has been incremented (let's denote its previous value as `i_prev`), so it must be adjusted to `i` being equal to `i_prev + 1`. 

Since `plen` is greater than 0, it is possible that `plen` is at least 2 or more, but to ensure that the loop executes again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `plen`. Thus, we adjust `plen` to be greater than `i` after the increment, which can be set to `plen` being greater than `i` (which is now equal to `i_prev + 1`).

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than `i`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`**
