Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `qlen` equals `plen`, there is no action taken as the condition is not triggered.***
