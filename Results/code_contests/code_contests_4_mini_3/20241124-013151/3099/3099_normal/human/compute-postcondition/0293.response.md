Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `i` is `p0len`, and `y0` is False. If the character at position `i` in `p0` is a '?', and the character at position `i` in `q` is not found in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks from the loop. If, instead, the character at position `i` in `p0` does not match the character at position `i` in `q`, the program likewise prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks from the loop, indicating a mismatch. If either condition does not trigger, the program continues without any changes to `y0`, which remains False, ensuring that all edge cases are covered concerning character matching and the use of the '?' wildcard.***
