Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `y0` remains unchanged. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues to the next iteration, maintaining the state of `y1` and the conditions of the variables as described.***
