Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` remains False. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark and the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, nothing is printed, and `y` retains its value of False. If the character at index `i` of `p` is not a question mark and does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` remains False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In summary, if any condition fails the checks, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False, otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.***
