Postcondition: ***If the character at index `i` of `p1` does not match the character at index `i` of `qr`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the loop or if statement. This implies that the character at index `i` of `qr` must match the corresponding character in `p1` (unless `p1[i]` is '?'). Additionally, it is ensured that `good_letters` contains only valid characters from `gls`, `pattern` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, and `p1len` is greater than 0, along with the updated length `qlen` of `q` being maintained. If the loop continues without breaking, then all characters at the corresponding indices of `p1` and `qr` are either equal or `p1[i]` is '?'.***
