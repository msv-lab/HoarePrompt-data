Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is set to False, and the program prints 'NO' if the character at index `i` of `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, then the values of `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, `qlen`, and `y` remain unchanged and the program continues execution without interruption.***
