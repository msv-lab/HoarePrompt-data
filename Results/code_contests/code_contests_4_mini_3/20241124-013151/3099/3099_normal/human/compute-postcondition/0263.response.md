Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `y0` is True, `i` is 0, the character at position `i` in `p0` is '?', and the character at position `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`; the output is 'NO'.**
