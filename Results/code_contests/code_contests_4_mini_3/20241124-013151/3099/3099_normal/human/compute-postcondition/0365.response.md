Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, the element at index `i` of `p0` is equal to '?', the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
