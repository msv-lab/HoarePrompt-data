The code snippet prints 'NO', which affects the output state but does not modify any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is True, `qr` is created but its value is unknown, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of the list `p1` is equal to '?', and the value of `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO'.
