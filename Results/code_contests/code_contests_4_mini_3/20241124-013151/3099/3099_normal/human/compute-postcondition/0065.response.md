The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark (`'?'`, and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
