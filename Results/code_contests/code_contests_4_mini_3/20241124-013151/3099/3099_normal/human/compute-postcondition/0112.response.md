Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is False if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the loop breaks. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True and no action is taken.***
