Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is equal to `plen`. If `p[i]` is a wildcard character '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks. If `p[i]` is not a wildcard and does not match `q[i]`, then the output is also 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks. If `p[i]` is a wildcard and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, or if `p[i]` matches `q[i]`, then there is no action taken regarding `y` or output, and the program continues.***
