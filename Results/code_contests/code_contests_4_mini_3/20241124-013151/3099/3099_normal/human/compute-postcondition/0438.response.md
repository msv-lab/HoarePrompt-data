The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `y0` and `y1` remain unchanged at False and False, respectively. The state of the program indicates that the loop will continue iterating without affecting the values of `y0` or `y1`. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` remains False, `y1` is False, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`y0` remains False, `y1` is False, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
