The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the other variables (`y0`, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the function prints 'NO'**
