Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `y0` is False, and if the character at position `i` of the substring `p0` is not a question mark and does not match the character at position `i` of the string `q` (i.e., `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`), then 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the characters match, there is no change to `y0` or any other variables, and the program continues executing without entering this conditional block.***
