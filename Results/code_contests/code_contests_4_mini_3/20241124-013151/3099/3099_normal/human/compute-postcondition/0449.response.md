Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, and `p1` retains its initial state. If the set of characters in `t`, which is a substring of `q`, intersects with `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program proceeds without printing 'NO', ensuring that `t` does not contain any characters from `good_letters`.***
