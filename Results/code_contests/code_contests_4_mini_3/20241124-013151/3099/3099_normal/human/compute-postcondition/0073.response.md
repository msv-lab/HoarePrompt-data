Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `y` is set to False if either the character at index `i` of `p` is a '?' and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the character at index `i` of `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a '?' and the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, or if the characters at indices `i` of both `p` and `q` are equal, then `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, `qlen`, and `y` remain unchanged with no output generated.***
