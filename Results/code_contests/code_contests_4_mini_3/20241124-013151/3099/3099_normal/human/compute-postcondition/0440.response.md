The variable `t` is assigned the value `None`. The initial states of `y0`, `y1`, and `p1` remain unchanged since the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `y0`, `y1`, and `p1`, and the new value of `t`.

Output State: **`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, `p1` has its initial state, `t` is None**
