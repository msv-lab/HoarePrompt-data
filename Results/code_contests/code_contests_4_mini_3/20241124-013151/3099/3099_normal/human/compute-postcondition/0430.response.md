The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and 'NO' is printed.**
