According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1, as it will be decremented by 1 after each iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is unchanged, and `t` is a substring of `q` starting from index `p0len:` if `p1len` is equal to 0, or from index `p0len` to index `-p1len` if `p1len` is greater than 0.**
