The variable `y1` is explicitly assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not depend on any previous values of `y1`, as it is being set directly. The other variables remain unchanged, and their states do not affect the outcome of this assignment.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `y0` remains True or False, and `y1` is False.**
