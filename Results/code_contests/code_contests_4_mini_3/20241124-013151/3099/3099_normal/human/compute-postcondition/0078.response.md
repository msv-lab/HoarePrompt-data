Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `plen`. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y`, and the program continues its execution without breaking.***
