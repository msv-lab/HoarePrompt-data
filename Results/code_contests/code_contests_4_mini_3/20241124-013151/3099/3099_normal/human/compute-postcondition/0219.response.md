Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is set to False if the character at index `i` of `q` (denoted as `qr[i]`) is not in `good_letters`, causing a 'NO' to be printed and breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the flow continues without any changes to `y1`.***
