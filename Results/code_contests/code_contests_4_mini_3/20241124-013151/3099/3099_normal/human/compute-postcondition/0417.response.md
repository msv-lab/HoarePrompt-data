The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state indicates that `y0` is already `False`, and `y1` remains unchanged, which implies that the previous value of `y1` is not specified but can be anything (it could be `True`, `False`, or any other value). The assignment of `False` to `y1` will overwrite its previous value. Other variables (`p1len`, `i`, and the printed string 'NO') are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the string 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the string 'NO' is printed**
