In this case, `y1` is assigned the value `False`. Its previous state is not specified, but according to the initial state, `y1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the function prints 'NO'**
