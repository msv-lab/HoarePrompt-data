The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`, which overwrites its previous value of `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, and since the only change is to `y1`, the output state reflects the new value of `y1`. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is created but its value is unknown, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and it prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is created but its value is unknown, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and it prints 'NO'**
