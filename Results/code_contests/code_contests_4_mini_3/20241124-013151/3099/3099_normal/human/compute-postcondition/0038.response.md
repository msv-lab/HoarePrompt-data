According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `plen`. The loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `plen - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `plen`, which means that the loop has completed all its iterations and cannot execute again unless `plen` is incremented or `i` is reset.

Since `plen` is greater than 0, the loop has executed `plen` times, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `plen` and `plen` should remain unchanged. 

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is equal to `plen`**
