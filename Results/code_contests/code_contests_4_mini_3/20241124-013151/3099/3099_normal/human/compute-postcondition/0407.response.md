Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains False, `qr` is created but its value is unknown, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO' and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without modifying `y1`.***
