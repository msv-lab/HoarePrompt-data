The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `q`, `p0`, `y0`, and `i` remain unchanged as the print function does not alter any of them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string with length `qlen`, `p0` is a string with length `p0len`, `y0` remains in its current state, `i` is less than `p0len - 1`, and the output 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string with length `qlen`, `p0` is a string with length `p0len`, `y0` remains in its current state, `i` is less than `p0len - 1`, and 'NO' is printed.**
