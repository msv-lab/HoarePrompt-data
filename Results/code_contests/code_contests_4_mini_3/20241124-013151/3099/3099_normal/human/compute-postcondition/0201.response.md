According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p1len`. For the loop to execute at least once, `p1len` must be greater than 0. Given that the state indicates `p1len` is already greater than 0, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, `i` will begin at 0, which is the initial value for the loop variable. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the initial value of `i` and the condition that allows the loop to execute.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is True, `qr` is the reversed string of `q`, `i` is 0**
