Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is set to False if either `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters` (causing a 'NO' to be printed and breaking the loop) or if `p1[i]` does not equal `qr[i]` (resulting in 'NO' being printed and breaking the loop). If both conditions are satisfied (i.e., `qr[i]` is in `good_letters` and `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`), the flow continues without any changes to `y1`.***
