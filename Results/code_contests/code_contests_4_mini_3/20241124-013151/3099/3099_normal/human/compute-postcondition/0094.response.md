According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `plen`, meaning the loop cannot execute again. To allow the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, which means `i` should be set to `plen + 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, and `qlen` are not required to change for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than `qlen`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `plen + 1`**
