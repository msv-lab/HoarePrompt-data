Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than `i`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
