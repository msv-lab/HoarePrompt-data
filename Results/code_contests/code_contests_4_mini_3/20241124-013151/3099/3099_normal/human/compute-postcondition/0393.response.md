Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string of length `qlen`, `p0` is a string of length `p0len`, and `i` is less than `p0len - 1`. If the character at position `i` in `p0` is a '?', and the character at position `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the character at position `i` in `p0` is a '?', but the character in `q` is in `good_letters`, there are no changes to `y0` or output. If the character at position `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop; if they match, then there is no change to `y0` or output.***
