Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than `qlen`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `plen`. If the character at position `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop. If the character at position `i` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y` or the output, and the execution continues.***
