According to the code, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than the current iteration count. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, meaning the loop has executed at least once, and `n` must be decremented after each iteration. 

To execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 1. The other states remain unchanged as they do not depend on the loop's iteration count.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and if `y` is True, 'YES' is printed. If `y` is False, no output is produced.**
