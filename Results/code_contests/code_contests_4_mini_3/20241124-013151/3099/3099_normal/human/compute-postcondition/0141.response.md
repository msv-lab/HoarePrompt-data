Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `y` will be set to False if any character in `p` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if any character in `p` does not match the corresponding character in `q` (with `p[i]` not being '?'). If both `plen` and `qlen` are greater than 0, the loop will execute `plen` times. If `plen` is 0 or if `qlen` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `y` remains True.**
