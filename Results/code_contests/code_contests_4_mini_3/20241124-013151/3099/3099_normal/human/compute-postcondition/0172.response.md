Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, and if the character at index `i` of `p0` is not a question mark and is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, the output is 'NO' and execution breaks out of the loop. The program only proceeds to the next iteration if the characters match.***
