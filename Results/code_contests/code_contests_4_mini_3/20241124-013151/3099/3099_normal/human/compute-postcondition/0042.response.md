Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is equal to `plen`. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character is in `good_letters`, no action is taken, and the flow continues past this condition.***
