The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the other variables (`good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, and `qlen`) remain unchanged and are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the action of printing.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
