Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then `y0` is set to False, and 'NO' is printed, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, then `y0` remains True and the execution continues without any change to `y0` or output.***
