Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the program processes `n` query strings against the pattern `p`. For each query, if its length `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed. If `qlen` equals `plen`, the program checks each character against `p`; if `p[i]` is '?', it verifies that `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, and if any conditions fail, 'NO' is printed. If all conditions are satisfied, 'YES' is printed. If `n` is 0, no queries are processed, and all variables remain unchanged. If `p` contains '*', it checks that each query has a length of at least `plen - 1`. It verifies the prefix `p0` against the start of each query and the reversed suffix `p1` against the end of each query, printing 'NO' if either check fails. If both checks pass and the substring between `p0` and `p1` contains no characters from `good_letters`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The overall state of the program includes the unchanged variables `good_letters`, `pattern`, and `n`, while `plen` remains constant, and `qlen` reflects the lengths of the processed queries.***
