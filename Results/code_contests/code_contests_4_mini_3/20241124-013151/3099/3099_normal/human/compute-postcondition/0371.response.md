Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, the element of `p0` at index `i` is not '?', the element of `p0` at index `i` is not equal to the element of `q` at index `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; output is 'NO'**
