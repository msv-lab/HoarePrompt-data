Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `y0` will be set to False if there is a mismatch between characters at corresponding indices in `p0` and `q`, or if a '?' in `p0` corresponds to a character in `q` that is not in `good_letters`. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute and `y0` remains True. If `p0len` is greater than `qlen`, the loop does not execute and `y0` remains True, as there are not enough characters in `q` to match `p0`. In all other cases, if the characters match or a '?' in `p0` is matched by a character in `good_letters`, `y0` remains unchanged.**
