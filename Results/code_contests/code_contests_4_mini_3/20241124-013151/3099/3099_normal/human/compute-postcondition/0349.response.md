Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `y1` is False indicating a mismatch occurred during the checks against the reversed string `qr`, and `t` is assigned the value of `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0 or the substring of `q` from index `p0len` to index `-p1len` otherwise. If the intersection of the set of characters in `t` with `good_letters` is non-empty, then 'NO' is printed, and the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, no action is taken. This covers all cases, including when `t` contains no characters from `good_letters`, ensuring that both edge cases of `t` being empty or containing characters are addressed.***
