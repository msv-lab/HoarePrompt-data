According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range defined by `plen`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` would have taken on the value of `plen - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `plen`, which means that `i` needs to be adjusted to `plen`, and the loop will stop executing once `i` equals `plen`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, `qlen`, and `y` remain unchanged.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `plen`**.
