According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `plen`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached the current value, and since the loop iterates for `i` from 0 to `plen - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented.

Given that `plen` is greater than 0, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be changed to `plen` on the next iteration. There are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is equal to `plen`**
