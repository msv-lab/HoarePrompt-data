Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is False, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` remains False. If the character at index `i` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without printing anything and `y` retains its value of False.***
