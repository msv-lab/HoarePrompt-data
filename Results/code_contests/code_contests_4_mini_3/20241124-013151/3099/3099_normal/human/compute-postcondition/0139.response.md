Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than `i`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If the character at position `i` in `p` is a '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at position `i` in `p` does not match the character at position `i` in `q`, then `y` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases, the execution continues without modifying `y` or producing any output.***
