The code prints 'NO' to the output. The values of the variables do not change as printing does not affect them. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values. 

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is True, `i` is 0, `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`; and the output is 'NO'**.
