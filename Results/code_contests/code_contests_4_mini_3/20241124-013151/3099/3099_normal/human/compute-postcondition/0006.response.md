According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The states that need to be adjusted are that `n` should be greater than 0, and since the loop variable `_` is typically used as a placeholder, it doesnâ€™t require an initial value. However, we can note that the loop will iterate `n` times.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`**
