According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `plen`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `plen + 1`, but since this is beyond the range defined by `range(plen)`, we need to adjust `plen` to be greater than `i` which is `plen`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state so that `plen` is greater than `i` (which is `plen`). No other states need to be adjusted because `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, and `qlen` remain unchanged.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `plen`**.
