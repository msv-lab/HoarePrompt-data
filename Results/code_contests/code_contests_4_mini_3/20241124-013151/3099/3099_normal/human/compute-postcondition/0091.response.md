The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is `plen`, the function prints 'NO', and `y` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
