Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `plen`. If the character at index `i` of the pattern `p` does not match the character at index `i` of the input string `q`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
