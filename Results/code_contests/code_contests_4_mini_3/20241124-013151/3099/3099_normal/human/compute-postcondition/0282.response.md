Postcondition: ***If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` remains False, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variables `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, `p0`, `p1`, `p0len`, `p1len`, `q`, `qlen`, `i`, and their respective states remain unchanged, except for the control flow which exits the current loop or condition block.***
