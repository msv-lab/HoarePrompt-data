Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains False if `p1[i]` is either '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. If `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True and the program continues. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` also remains True while the program continues execution. The variable `qr` is created but its value is unknown, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.***
