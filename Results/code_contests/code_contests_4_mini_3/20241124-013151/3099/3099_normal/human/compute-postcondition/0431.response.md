The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `y0` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. The value of `i` is 2, and `p1len` is greater than 2, but these values are also not affected by the assignment. The printed output 'NO' is not changed by this code either. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged states of `y0`, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len`.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and 'NO' is printed.**
