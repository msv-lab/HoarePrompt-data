Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 0, and if the character at position `i` in `p` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `q` (and is also not '?'), the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, the program continues execution without any changes to `y`, and the state of the other variables remains as initially described.***
