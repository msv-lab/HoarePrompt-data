The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string with length `qlen`, `p0` is a string with length `p0len`, `y0` is False, `i` is less than `p0len - 1`, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
