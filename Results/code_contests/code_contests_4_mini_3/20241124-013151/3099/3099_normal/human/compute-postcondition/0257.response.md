The statement `continue` is used to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, and it affects only the control flow of a loop, the output state remains unchanged for the variables.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is unchanged, `t` is a substring of `q` starting from index `p0len:` if `p1len` is equal to 0, or from index `p0len` to index `-p1len` if `p1len` is greater than 0; `qlen` is now updated to the length of `q`, and the output is 'NO' and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
