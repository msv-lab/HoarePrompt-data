The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this action. Therefore, the output state includes all previously defined values, along with the indication that the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is False, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
