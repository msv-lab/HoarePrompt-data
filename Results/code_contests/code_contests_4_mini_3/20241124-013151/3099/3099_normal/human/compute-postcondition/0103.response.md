The `continue` statement is executed, which will skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration without changing any variable states or values. The values of `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, and `qlen` remain unchanged. The output state notes that 'NO' has been printed to the console previously. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and 'NO' was printed to the console.
