Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is set to False if `p1[i]` does not equal `qr[i]`, at which point the function prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, the program continues without any changes to the state of `y1`.***
