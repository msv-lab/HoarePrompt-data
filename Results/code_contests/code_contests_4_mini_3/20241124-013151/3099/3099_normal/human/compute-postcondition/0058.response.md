Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the function prints 'NO'. If `qlen` is equal to `plen`, no action is taken in this fragment.***
