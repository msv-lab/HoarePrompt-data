Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `y1` is False indicating a mismatch occurred during the checks against the reversed string `qr`, `t` is assigned the value of `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0 or the substring of `q` from index `p0len` to index `-p1len` otherwise, and both `y0` and `y1` are True.***
