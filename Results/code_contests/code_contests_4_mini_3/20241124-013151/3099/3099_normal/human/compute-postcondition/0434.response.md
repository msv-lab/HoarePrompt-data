Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `p1len` is greater than 2. If the character at index `i` in `p1` is '?', and if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the program continues without changes to `y1`. Additionally, if `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, or if `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, the program continues execution without printing 'NO'.***
