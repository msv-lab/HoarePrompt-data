Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than 0, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed to the console. Otherwise, there is no output or action taken by the program.***
