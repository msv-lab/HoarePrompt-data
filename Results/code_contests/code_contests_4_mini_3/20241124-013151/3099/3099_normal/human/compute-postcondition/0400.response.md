The code snippet `qr = q[::-1]` attempts to reverse a sequence `q`. However, since there is no initial state provided for `q`, its value is unknown. The values of `y0` and `y1` are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `y0` and `y1`, while indicating that `qr` is created but its value cannot be determined.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is True, and `qr` is created but its value is unknown**
