Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, and `i` is `p0len - 1`. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, and `y0` remains False, with execution breaking out of the current loop. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is a '?', but the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, then no action is taken, and the program continues. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, and `y0` remains False, with execution breaking out of the current loop. In all cases, the variables `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, `p0`, `p1`, `p0len`, `p1len`, `q`, `qlen`, `i`, and the state of `y0` may be unchanged except for control flow changes.
