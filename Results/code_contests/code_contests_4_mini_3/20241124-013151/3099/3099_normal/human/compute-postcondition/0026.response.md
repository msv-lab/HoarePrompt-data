Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, if the character at position `i` in `p` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `q`, then `y` is set to False, and the loop exits. Otherwise, `y` remains True and the program continues without executing the print statement.***
