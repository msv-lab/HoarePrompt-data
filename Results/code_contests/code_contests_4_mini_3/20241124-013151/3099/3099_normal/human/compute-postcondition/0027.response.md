Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, if the character at index `i` of `p` is a wildcard `?` and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False, indicating the query character is invalid. If the character at index `i` of `p` is not a wildcard and does not match the corresponding character in `q`, then 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False. In all other scenarios, `y` remains True, and the program continues executing without printing 'NO'.***
