The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The variables `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `plen`, `qlen`, and `i` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any of their values. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `plen`, and the function prints 'NO'**
