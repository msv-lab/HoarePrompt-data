Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is set to False if any character at index `i` of `p1` does not match the corresponding character in `qr`, or if `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, in which case 'NO' is printed and the loop breaks. If `p1len` is 0, the loop doesnâ€™t execute, and `y1` remains unchanged. If `qr` is shorter than `p1`, it is also possible that the loop won't execute, and `y1` remains unchanged.**
