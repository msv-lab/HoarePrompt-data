Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string with length `qlen`, `y0` is a boolean that becomes False if `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, and in that case, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y0` remains True, and no action is taken regarding the print statement or breaking out of the loop.***
