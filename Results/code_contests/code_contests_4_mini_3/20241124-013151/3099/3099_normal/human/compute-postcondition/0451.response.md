The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The values of `y0`, `y1`, and `p1` remain unchanged. Since the initial state indicates that `y0` and `y1` are both False, the condition `y0 and y1` being true is indeed unreachable, but that does not affect the execution of the print statement.

Output State: **`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, `p1` retains its initial state, and 'YES' is printed.**
