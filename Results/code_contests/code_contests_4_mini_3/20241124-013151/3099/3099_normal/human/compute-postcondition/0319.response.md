Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the updated length of `q`. If the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the loop. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?' and does not match the character at index `i` of `qr`, then `y1` is also set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks. If both conditions for `y1` are satisfied, then `y1` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `p1len`. All these conditions ensure that the integrity of the variables and their relationships are maintained throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
