Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is equal to `plen`. If the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part, so any case where `q[i]` is in `good_letters` is not handled within this block, and the program continues without any action related to `y` or output.***
