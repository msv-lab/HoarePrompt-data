The value of `y` is set to `False`, changing it from `True` to `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are `good_letters` as a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `pattern` is a question mark (`?`), and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`. The state of other variables remains unchanged, and the printed output 'NO' does not affect the state.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 0, and 'NO' is printed.**
