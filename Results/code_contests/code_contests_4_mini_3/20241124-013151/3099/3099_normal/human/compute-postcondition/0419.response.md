Postcondition: ***`y0` is False; if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the values of `y0`, `y1`, and `p1len` remain unchanged, and the program continues executing without printing 'NO'.***
