The variable `p1` is assigned the value of `p1` reversed, which means that the order of characters in `p1` will be flipped. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is an input string, the query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', and `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'.
