Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `plen` is greater than `i`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and if the character at position `i` in `p` does not match the character at position `i` in `q`, then `y` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
