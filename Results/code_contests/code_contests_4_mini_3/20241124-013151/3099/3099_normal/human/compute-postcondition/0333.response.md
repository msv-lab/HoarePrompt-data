Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than `i`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, if the character at index `i` of `p1` does not match the character at index `i` of `qr`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no changes occur.***
