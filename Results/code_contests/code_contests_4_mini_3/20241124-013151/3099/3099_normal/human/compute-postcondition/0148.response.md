The code `p0, p1 = p.split('*')` splits the string `p` into two parts using the '*' character as the delimiter. This means that `p0` will be assigned the substring that appears before the first '*' in `p` and `p1` will be assigned the substring that appears after the first '*' in `p`. The initial state indicates that `p` contains at least one '*' character, ensuring that both `p0` and `p1` will have valid values. 

Other variables such as `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, and `plen` remain unchanged by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is an input string, the query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', and `p1` is the substring after '*'.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is an input string, the query strings remain unchanged, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', and `p1` is the substring after '*'**.
