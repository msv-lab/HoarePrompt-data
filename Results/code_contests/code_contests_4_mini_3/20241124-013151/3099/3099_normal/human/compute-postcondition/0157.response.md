The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q` such that `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, and the output is 'NO'.
