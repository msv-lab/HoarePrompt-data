Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, and if `y1` is False, indicating a mismatch occurred during the checks against the reversed string `qr`, the loop continues without making changes to any variables. If `p1len` equals 0, all variables retain their initial values, and `y1` remains True, meaning no mismatches were found. The state of the program reflects these conditions after the execution of the if statement.***
