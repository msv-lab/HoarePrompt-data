Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and if `y0` is False due to a mismatch between characters at corresponding indices in `p0` and `q`, or if a '?' in `p0` corresponds to a character in `q` that is not in `good_letters`, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing further code. If `y0` is True, the execution proceeds past the if statement. Additionally, if `p0len` is 0 or greater than `qlen`, the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True.***
