Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `q` is a string with length `qlen`, if the character at position `i` in `p0` is '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output will be 'NO', `y0` will be set to False, and execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y0` remains True with no output. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output will be 'NO', `y0` will be set to False, and execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y0` remains True with no output. Therefore, the final state of `y0` will be False if either condition fails, and True if both conditions are satisfied.***
