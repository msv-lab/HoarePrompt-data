Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` is False, indicating that either a '?' in `p1` had a corresponding `qr` value not in `good_letters`, or that a character in `p1` did not match the corresponding character in `qr`. If `p1` has a length greater than 0, the loop has executed at least once, and `qr` has been created and may have affected the outcome based on the conditions checked. If `p1` is empty, `y1` remains True.***
