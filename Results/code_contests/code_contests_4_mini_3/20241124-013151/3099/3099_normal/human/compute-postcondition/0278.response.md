Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `i` is `p0len - 1`, and `y0` is False. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not present in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` remains False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if the character is in `good_letters`, no action is taken, and the state continues without interruption.***
