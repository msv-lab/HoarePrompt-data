Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False. If `y1` is False, the loop continues to the next iteration without making any changes to the variables. If `p1` is empty, `y1` remains True, indicating no iterations occurred. If `p1` has a length greater than 0 and `y1` is False, the loop will continue executing until the end of `p1`, maintaining `y0` as False and `y1` as False throughout the iterations.***
