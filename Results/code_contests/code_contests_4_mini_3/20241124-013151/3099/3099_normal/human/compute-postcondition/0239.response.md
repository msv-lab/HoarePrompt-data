Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, and if `y1` is False, the loop continues to the next iteration without any changes to `y0`, `y1`, or the other variables, while if `y1` is True, the current iteration of the loop continues executing the subsequent statements. If `p1len` is 0 or if `qr` is shorter than `p1`, `y1` remains unchanged, and the loop does not execute further validation.***
