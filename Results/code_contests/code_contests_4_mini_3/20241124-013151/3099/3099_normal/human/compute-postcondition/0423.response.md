Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, and if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the output is 'NO' and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, there is no change to `y1`, and the loop continues if applicable. Additionally, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.***
