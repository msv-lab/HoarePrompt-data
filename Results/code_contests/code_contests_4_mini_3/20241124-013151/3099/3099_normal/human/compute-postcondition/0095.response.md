Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `y` will be set to False if any character at index `i` of `p` is '?' and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the character at index `i` of `p` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`. If all conditions are satisfied for all indices from 0 to `plen - 1`, `y` remains True. If `plen` is greater than `qlen`, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True as no comparisons can be made. If `plen` is less than or equal to `qlen` and `y` is set to False at any point, the program will output 'NO'.**
