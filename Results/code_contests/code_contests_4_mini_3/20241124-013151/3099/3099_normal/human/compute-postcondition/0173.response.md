Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and if the character at index `i` of `p0` is a question mark, then `y0` remains True if the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, otherwise, it is set to False and 'NO' is printed. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not a question mark and does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and execution breaks out of the loop. If the characters match, `y0` remains unchanged, and execution continues. Thus, the program verifies the conditions based on the characters at index `i` and updates `y0` accordingly.***
