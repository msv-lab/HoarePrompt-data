Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is set to False if the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, in which case 'NO' is printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the character at index `i` of `p1` does not equal the character at index `i` of `qr`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is also set to False; if they match, `y1` remains unchanged and the program continues. If the character at index `i` of `qr` is in `good_letters`, or if the characters at indexes `p1[i]` and `qr[i]` are equal, the program continues without any changes to `y1` or any output.***
