Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, `y0` is True initially, `i` is 0, and `p0len` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is '?', then if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y0` to False; otherwise, `y0` remains True. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not '?', and it does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y0` to False; otherwise, there are no changes to `y0`. All cases are handled, ensuring that `y0` reflects the validity of the characters in `q` according to the conditions defined by `p0`.***
