Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is set to False, and if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed and the loop is exited. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, then the program continues without any changes to `y`, and no output is generated.***
