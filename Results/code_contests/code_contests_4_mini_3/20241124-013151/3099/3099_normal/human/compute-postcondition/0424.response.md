Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged, and if `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, there are no changes to `y1`. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', then if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, there are no changes to `y1`. Additionally, `p1len` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1 throughout the execution.***
