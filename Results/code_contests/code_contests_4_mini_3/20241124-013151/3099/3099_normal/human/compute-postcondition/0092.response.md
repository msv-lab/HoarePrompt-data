Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is greater than `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is `plen`. If the character at position `i` in `p` does not match the character at position `i` in `q`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters do match, the program continues executing without altering `y` or producing any output.***
