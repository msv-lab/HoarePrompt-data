The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same, indicating that the loop will continue without executing the subsequent code for the current iteration.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the updated length of `q`, `y0` remains True or False, and `y1` is False due to a mismatch occurring during the checks against the reversed string `qr`. The loop has executed and found a mismatch, leading to the conclusion that not all conditions were satisfied, and the loop will continue.**
