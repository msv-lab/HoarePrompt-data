Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the input string `gls`, `pattern` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is unchanged, and `t` is assigned the substring of `q` starting from index `p0len:` if `p1len` is equal to 0, or the substring of `q` from index `p0len` to index `-p1len` if `p1len` is greater than 0. Edge cases regarding the lengths of `q`, `p0len`, and `p1len` are handled, ensuring that `t` is correctly formed based on the conditions.***
