Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True, and the program continues execution. The variable `qr` is created but its value is unknown, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0, with `p1[i]` not equal to '?'.***
