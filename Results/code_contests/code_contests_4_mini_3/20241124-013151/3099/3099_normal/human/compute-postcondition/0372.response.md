Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is True, `i` is 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, and the element of `p0` at index `i` is not '?'. If the element of `p0` at index `i` is not equal to the element of `q` at index `i`, the output is 'NO', and `y0` is set to False; otherwise, there are no changes to `y0` or any output.***
