Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `i` is 0, and if the element `p0[i]` is not equal to the element `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the state remains unchanged.***
