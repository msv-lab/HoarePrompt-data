Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y1` is False indicating that at least one condition was not met during the loop execution for `p1` against `qr`, `t` is assigned the substring of `q` starting from index `p0len` if `p1len` is 0, or the substring `q[p0len:-p1len]` if `p1len` is greater than 0, and the intersection of the set of characters in `t` and `good_letters` is not empty, indicating that `t` contains at least one character from `good_letters`.***
