Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, and `qr` is the reversed value of `q`. If the character at index `i` (which is 1) of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', and the loop breaks; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
