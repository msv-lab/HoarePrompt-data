Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and `i` is less than `p1len`. If `y1` was False, the current iteration is skipped; otherwise, the program's state remains unchanged. If `p1len` is 0, `y1` remains True and no iterations are executed.***
