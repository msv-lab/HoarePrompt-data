The value of `y` is assigned `True`, but since `y` was already `True` in the initial state, there is no change to the state of the variable `y`. The values of the other variables `plen` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, and `n` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, and `n` is greater than 0**
