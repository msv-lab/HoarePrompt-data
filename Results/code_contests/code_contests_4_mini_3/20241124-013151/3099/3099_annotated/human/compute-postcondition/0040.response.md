The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `i` is equal to `plen`, `y` is False, and the output is 'NO'.
