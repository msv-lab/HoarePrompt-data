The code creates a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`. The variable `good_letters` is now a set that contains each unique character in `gls`, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`**
