According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `plen` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again. For the loop to run one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The variable `p[i]` will need to be evaluated in the next iteration, and since the current state does not provide specific information about `p[2]`, it will remain unchanged. 

So, to adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `i` should be updated to 2.

State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
