Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and if `y1` is False, indicating that at least one condition was not met during the loop execution for `p1` against `qr`, the loop will continue to the next iteration without executing further statements. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True, meaning all conditions were deemed met. If `p1` consists solely of '?' characters, `y1` will also remain unaffected as long as all characters in `qr` are found within `good_letters`.***
