Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, and `i` is equal to `plen`. If the character at position `i` in string `p` does not match the character at position `i` in string `q`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters do match, the program continues without any changes to `y` or printing. Edge cases include scenarios where `i` is equal to the length of `p` or `q`, which should be handled prior to this condition to avoid index errors.***
