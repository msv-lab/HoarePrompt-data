Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is unchanged, `p0len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, and if `qlen` (the length of input string `q`) is less than `plen - 1`, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, the program does not print anything and continues executing the following statements in the loop.***
