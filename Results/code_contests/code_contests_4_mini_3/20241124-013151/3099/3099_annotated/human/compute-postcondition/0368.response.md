Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, the element `p0[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`.***
