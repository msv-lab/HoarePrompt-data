Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?', the program prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`; otherwise, the variables remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', the program prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. If both conditions are satisfied, the function continues execution without any changes to the variables.***
