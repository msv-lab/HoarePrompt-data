The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not modify any variables or affect their values. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged aside from the printed output.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y1` is True, `qr` is the string `q` reversed, `i` is 0, the `i`-th character of `p1` is not '?', and the `i`-th character of `p1` is not equal to the `i`-th character of `qr`, and the function prints 'NO'.**
