The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `plen` and `i` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of `plen` and `i` along with the printed output.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'**
