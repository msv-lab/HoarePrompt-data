Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, and `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1. If the elements at index `i` in arrays `p` and `q` are not equal, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If the elements are equal, no changes are made to `y`, and the program continues without exiting the loop.***
