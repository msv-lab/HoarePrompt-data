Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is less than `p1len`, there is at least one character in `t` that is also in `good_letters`, and we continue to the next iteration.**
