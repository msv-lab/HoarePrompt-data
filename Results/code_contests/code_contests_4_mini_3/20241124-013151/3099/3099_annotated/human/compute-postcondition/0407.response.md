Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is `q` reversed, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if the first character of `qr` (which corresponds to the first element of `p1` at index `i`, a question mark) is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the loop is exited. If the character is in `good_letters`, the state of `y1` remains True, and the program continues executing without any changes to `y0` or `y1`.***
