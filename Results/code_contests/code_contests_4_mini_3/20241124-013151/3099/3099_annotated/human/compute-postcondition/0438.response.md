The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1` is a list that has a length greater than 0, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, there exists at least one index `i` such that either `p1[i]` is a '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or `p1[i]` does not match `qr[i]`, and `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
