Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, the program does not print anything and proceeds with further execution.***
