Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', then if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks from the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks from the loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes occur to `y` or any other variables.***
