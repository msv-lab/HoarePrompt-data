Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` remains the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and if the character at index `i` (which is 1) in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at that index is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains unchanged.***
