Output State: **If `plen` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `plen` times. If any `p[i]` is equal to '?', then if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, or if `q[i]` is in `good_letters` when `p[i]` is '?', `y` remains unchanged. If `plen` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute, leaving `y` as True.**
