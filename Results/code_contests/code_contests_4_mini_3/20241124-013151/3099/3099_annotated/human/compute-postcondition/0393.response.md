Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, `p1len` remains unchanged, `p0len` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `qlen` remains unchanged. If the character at index 2 of `p0` is a '?', and if the character `q[2]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the loop. If `p0[2]` is not equal to `q[2]`, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the loop. Thus, 'NO' is printed if either condition is met, indicating a mismatch or an invalid character.***
