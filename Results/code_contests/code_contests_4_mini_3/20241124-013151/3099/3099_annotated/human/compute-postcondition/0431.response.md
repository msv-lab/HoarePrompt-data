The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, but it is already `False` based on the initial state. Therefore, the value of `y1` remains unchanged. The other variables (`y0`, `qr`, `p1len`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` remains the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed.**
