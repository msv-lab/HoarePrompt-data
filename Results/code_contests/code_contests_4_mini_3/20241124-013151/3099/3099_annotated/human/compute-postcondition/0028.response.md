According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `i` must be less than `plen` for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, if the loop has executed at least once, `i` must now be equal to `plen - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `plen`, thus `plen` must remain unchanged while `i` becomes `plen`.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `y` is set to False, `i` is `plen`**
