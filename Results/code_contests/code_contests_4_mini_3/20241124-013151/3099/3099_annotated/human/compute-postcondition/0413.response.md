Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, the function prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` remains True.***
