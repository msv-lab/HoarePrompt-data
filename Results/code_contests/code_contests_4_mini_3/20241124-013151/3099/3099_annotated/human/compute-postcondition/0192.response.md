Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than or equal to 3, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is equal to `p0len`. If the character at position `i` in `p0` does not match the character at position `i` in `q`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `y0` or output.***
