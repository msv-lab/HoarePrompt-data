The value of `y0` is assigned `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is less than `p1len`, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is less than `p1len`, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`.**
