Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is assigned the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', and if the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.***
