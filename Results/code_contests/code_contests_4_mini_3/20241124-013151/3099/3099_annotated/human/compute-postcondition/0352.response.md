Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, the value of `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and `i` is less than `p1len`. If both `y0` and `y1` are True, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, no output occurs.***
