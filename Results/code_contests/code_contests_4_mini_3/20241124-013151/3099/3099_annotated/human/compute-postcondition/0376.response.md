Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and the output is 'NO'**
