The value of `y` is changed from `True` to `False`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, and the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `y`.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `y` is False, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `i` is 0, `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.**
