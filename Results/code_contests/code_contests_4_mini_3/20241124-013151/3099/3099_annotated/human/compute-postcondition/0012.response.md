Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the function prints 'NO' and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` is equal to `plen`, there are no actions taken in this code fragment.***
