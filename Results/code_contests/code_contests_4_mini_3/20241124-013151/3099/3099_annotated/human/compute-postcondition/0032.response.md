Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, and `i` is equal to `plen`. If the character at index `i` of the string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without any changes to `y` or printing 'NO'.***
