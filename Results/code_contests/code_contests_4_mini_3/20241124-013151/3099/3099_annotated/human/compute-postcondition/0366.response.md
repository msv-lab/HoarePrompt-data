Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and if the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to `y0`, `y1`, and other variables.***
