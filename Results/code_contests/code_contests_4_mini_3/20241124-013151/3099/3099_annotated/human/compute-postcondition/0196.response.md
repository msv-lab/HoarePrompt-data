Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `y0` is False indicating that at least one character at index `i` in `p0` does not match the corresponding character in `q`, or a character in `p0` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`. Additionally, it is noted that if the loop executed, `i` is within the bounds of `p0` and `q` before the condition is checked. If `p0len` is 0, the loop did not execute and `y0` remains True.***
