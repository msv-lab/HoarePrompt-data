According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `p1`, which is represented by `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `p1len` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 1, and since `p1len` remains unchanged, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 1**
