Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y1` is False indicating that at least one condition was not met during the loop execution for `p1` against `qr`, `y0` is True, and the intersection between the set of characters in `t` and `good_letters` has not been checked as the loop execution is conditional on both `y0` and `y1` being true. Additionally, if `p1len` is 0, then `t` is set to `q[p0len:]`; otherwise, `t` is set to `q[p0len:-p1len]`.***
