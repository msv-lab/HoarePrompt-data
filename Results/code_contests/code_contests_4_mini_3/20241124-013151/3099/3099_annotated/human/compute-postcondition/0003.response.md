The value of `plen` is assigned the length of the string `p`. Since `p` is an input string, the length of `p` will depend on the specific input provided. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, and `plen` is the length of the input string `p`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, and `plen` is the length of the input string `p`**
