The variable `p1len` is assigned the value of `len(p1)`, which calculates the length of the string `p1`. The initial state mentions that `p1` is a substring after '*', but its specific content is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `p1len`. However, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is an input string, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, and `p1len` is the length of `p1`**
