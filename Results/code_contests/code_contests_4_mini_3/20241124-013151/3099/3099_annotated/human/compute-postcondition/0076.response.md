The value of `y` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True`. The other variables `plen`, `qlen`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, `y` is False, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, `y` is False, and the output is 'NO'**
