Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `y` is set to False, and if the character at index `i` in string `p` does not match the character at index `i` in string `q`, the function prints 'NO' and breaks out of the innermost loop, ensuring that the comparison halts immediately upon finding the first mismatch.***
