The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`, which is its current value. Therefore, the state of `y1` remains unchanged. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'**
