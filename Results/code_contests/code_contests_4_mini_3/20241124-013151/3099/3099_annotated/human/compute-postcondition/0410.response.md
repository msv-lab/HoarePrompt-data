The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The variables in the initial state are not modified by this print operation. Therefore, the output state retains the values of the variables as they were initially. 

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is True, `qr` is `q` reversed, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, and the output is 'NO'**.
