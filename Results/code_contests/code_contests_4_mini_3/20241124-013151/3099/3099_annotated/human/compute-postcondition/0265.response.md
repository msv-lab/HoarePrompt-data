The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p0` is equal to '?', the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
