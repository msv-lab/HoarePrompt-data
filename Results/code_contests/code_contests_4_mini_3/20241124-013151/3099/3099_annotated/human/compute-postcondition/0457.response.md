Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of distinct lowercase English letters `good_letters`, a pattern string `p` which may include the wildcard character '*', and a positive integer `n` which indicates the number of query strings to process. It reads `n` query strings and checks them against the conditions specified by `p`. If `p` does not contain '*', for each query string `q`, it checks if its length matches `p` and verifies character conditions, returning 'YES' or 'NO' based on these checks. If `p` contains '*', it splits `p` into two parts, `p0` and `p1`, and checks if query strings match `p0` at the start and `p1` at the end, ensuring that the substring between them does not contain any characters from `good_letters`. If any conditions fail, it returns 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0, resulting in no output generated. Additionally, if `plen` (length of pattern `p`) is 0, it does not explicitly return 'YES' for each query which is a missing functionality, as per the annotations.**
