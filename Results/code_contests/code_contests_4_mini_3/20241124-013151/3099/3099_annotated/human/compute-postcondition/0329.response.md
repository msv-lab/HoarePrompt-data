Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and if the character at index `i` (which is 2) of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', `y1` remains False, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.***
