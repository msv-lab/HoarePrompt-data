Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than or equal to 3, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is equal to `p0len`. If the character at position `i` in `p0` is '?', and the character at position `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no actions are taken. If `p0[i]` is not '?', and it does not match `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, the program continues without any changes to `y0` or output. This ensures that `y0` is set to False if there is a mismatch or if the character is invalid according to `good_letters`.***
