The variable `y0` is assigned the value `True`, which was already its initial value. Therefore, the execution does not change the value of `y0`. The other variables remain unchanged as well. The program continues executing without any print statements. 

Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is unchanged, `p0len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, and the program continues executing without printing anything.**
