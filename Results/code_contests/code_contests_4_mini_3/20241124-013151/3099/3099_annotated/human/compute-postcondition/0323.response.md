Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, and `qr` is the reversed value of `q`. If the character at position `i` (which is 1) of `p1` does not match the character at the same position of `qr`, the program prints 'NO', and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, the program continues execution without printing anything or altering the values of `y0`, `y1`, `t`, `good_letters`, or `qr`.***
