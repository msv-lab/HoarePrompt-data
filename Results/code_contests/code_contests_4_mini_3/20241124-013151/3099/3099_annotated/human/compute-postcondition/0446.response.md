Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False. `t` is a slice of `q` that contains at least one element from `good_letters`, which means there is a non-empty intersection between the set of characters in `t` and `good_letters`. If `p1len` is 0, then `t` is a slice of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end of `q`. If `p1len` is greater than 0, then `t` is a slice of `q` from index `p0len` to index `-p1len`, excluding the last `p1len` elements of `q.`**
