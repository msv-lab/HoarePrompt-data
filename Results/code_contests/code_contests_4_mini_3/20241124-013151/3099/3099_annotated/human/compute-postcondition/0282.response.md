Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is unchanged, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, and if the character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, the output is 'NO' and the loop is exited. Otherwise, if the characters are equal, no changes occur to the variables or output.***
