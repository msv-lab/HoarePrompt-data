The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program continues executing the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same with respect to the variables.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y1` is False indicating that at least one condition was not met during the loop execution for `p1` against `qr`, and the function prints 'NO'.**
