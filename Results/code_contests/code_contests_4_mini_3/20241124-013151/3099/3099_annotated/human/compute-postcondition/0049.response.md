Output State: **If `plen` is greater than 0 and `qlen` is equal to `plen`, the loop will check each character in `p` against the corresponding character in `q`. If `p[i]` is '?', it allows `q[i]` to match any character as long as it's in `good_letters`; if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p[i]` is not '?', it must equal `q[i]`; if they differ, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If all characters match or are allowed, `y` remains True. If `plen` is 0 or `qlen` is less than `plen`, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True.**
