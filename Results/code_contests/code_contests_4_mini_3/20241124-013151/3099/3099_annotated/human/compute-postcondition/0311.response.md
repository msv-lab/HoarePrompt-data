The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, so after execution, `y1` is now `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and the output includes the new value of `y1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is assigned the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is assigned the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, and 'NO' is printed.**
