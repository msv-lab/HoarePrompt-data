Output State: **`y0` is False if any character in `p0` does not match the corresponding character in `q` and that character is not a '?' or if `p0[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`; otherwise, `y0` remains True. `y1` remains unchanged. `p1len` remains unchanged. `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0. `t` remains unchanged. `good_letters` remains unchanged. `qr` remains unchanged. `i` will be less than `p0len` if the loop executed. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True. If `p0len` is greater than 0 and the conditions for printing 'NO' are not met, then `y0` remains True. `n` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, and `qlen` remains unchanged.**
