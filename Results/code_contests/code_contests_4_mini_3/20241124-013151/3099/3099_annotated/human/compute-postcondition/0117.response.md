The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were inside. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed while we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed while we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
