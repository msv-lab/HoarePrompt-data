Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains False, and `qr` remains the reverse of `q`. If `p1[i]` is a '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and execution breaks. If `p1[i]` is a '?' and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, or if `p1[i]` matches `qr[i]`, then there are no changes to `y1`, and the execution continues without output. If `p1[i]` does not match `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed and execution breaks. The conditions regarding `p1len` being greater than 1 are maintained throughout.***
