Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False. If `t` contains any elements that intersect with `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the current loop iteration is skipped. If `t` does not intersect with `good_letters`, the program continues to the next iteration without printing anything.***
