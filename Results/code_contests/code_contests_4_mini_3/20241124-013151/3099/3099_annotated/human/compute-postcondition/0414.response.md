Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is True or False depending on the evaluation of the conditions. If `p1[i]` is a question mark and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If `p1[i]` is not a question mark and does not equal `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True. In all cases, `y0` remains False, `qr` is still the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.***
