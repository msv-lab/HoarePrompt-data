The function `func` accepts three parameters: `good_letters`, `p`, and `n`. 

- `good_letters` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters.
- `p` is a string containing lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*" character.
- `n` is a positive integer.

The function processes a list of query strings, which consist of lowercase English letters, and returns a list of results based on the criteria defined by the function. 

The functionality of the function is to check each query string against the patterns defined by `good_letters` and `p`, returning results that indicate whether each query string matches the specified conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string of distinct lowercase English letters `good_letters`, a string `p` containing lowercase English letters and patterns, and a positive integer `n`, and processes query strings to determine if they match the specified patterns.**
