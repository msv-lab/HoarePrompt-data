Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 1. If the character `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In case `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues executing without any change to `y1` or output.***
