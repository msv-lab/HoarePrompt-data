The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is `q` reversed, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
