Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, and `qr` is the reversed value of `q`. If the character at index `i` (which is 1) of `p1` is a question mark, and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks the loop. If `p1[i]` is not a question mark, the program prints 'NO' and breaks if `p1[i]` does not equal `qr[i]`. If neither condition is met, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
