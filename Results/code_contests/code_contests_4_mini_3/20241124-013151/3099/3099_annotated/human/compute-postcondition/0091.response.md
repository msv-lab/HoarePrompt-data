The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is greater than 1, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, `y` is False, and the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
