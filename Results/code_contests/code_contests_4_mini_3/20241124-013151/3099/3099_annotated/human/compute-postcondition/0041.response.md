The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `i` is equal to `plen`, `y` is False, and the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
