Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains unchanged and the program continues executing without printing 'NO' or affecting the values of `y` and `i`.***
