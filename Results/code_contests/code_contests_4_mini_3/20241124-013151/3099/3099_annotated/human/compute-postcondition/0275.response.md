The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is unchanged, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is unchanged, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'**
