Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, if `p1len` is 0, then `t` is equal to `q`, otherwise `t` is equal to the substring of `q` starting from `p0len` and excluding the last `p1len` characters. The value of `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and `i` is less than `p1len`.***
