Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 1, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, and `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y` or the output. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and execution breaks. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes are made to `y` or the output, and the program continues execution.***
