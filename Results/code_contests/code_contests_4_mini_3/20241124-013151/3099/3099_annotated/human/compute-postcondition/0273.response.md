Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is unchanged, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is '?', and if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop. Alternatively, if `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop. If `p0[i]` equals `q[i]`, all states remain unchanged.***
