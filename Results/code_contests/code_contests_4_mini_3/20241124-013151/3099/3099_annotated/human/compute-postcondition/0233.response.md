Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 2, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` (which is 2) in `p1` does not match the character at index `i` in `qr`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y1`, and the program continues executing subsequent statements without interruption.***
