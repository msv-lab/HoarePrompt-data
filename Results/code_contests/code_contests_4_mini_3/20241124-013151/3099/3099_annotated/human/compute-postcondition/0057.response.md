The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables `plen`, `qlen`, `y`, `n`, or `q` during this iteration. The output state remains unchanged for these variables, and the program will simply continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `y` is True, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `q` is an input string, and 'NO' has been printed.**
