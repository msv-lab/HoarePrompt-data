Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y1` is False if the character at index `i` of `qr` (the reversed string `q`) is not in `good_letters`. The program will print 'NO' and break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of `qr` is in `good_letters`, then `y1` remains True.***
