Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` is unchanged, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, and `good_letters` is unchanged. If `p0[i]` is '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is not '?', and if `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed and execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes occur to the variables or output.***
