The `print` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables, and the state of the variables remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False, and the condition `(y0 and y1)` is True, which implies `y1` must be True.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False, and the condition `(y0 and y1)` is True, which implies `y1` must be True; the output is 'YES'**.
