The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is assigned the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
