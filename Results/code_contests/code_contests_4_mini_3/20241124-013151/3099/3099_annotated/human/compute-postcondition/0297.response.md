The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `p0len`, `y0`, `y1`, `p1len`, `t`, and `good_letters` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing within the loop without altering these variables.

Output State: **`p0len` is greater than 0, `y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False, the state of `p1len`, `t`, and `good_letters` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
