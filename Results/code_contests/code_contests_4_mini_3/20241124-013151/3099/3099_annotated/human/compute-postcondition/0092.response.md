Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 1, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, and `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes are made to `y` or the output, and the program continues execution.***
