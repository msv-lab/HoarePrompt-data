Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `y` is False, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `p` is equal to '?'. If the element at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, there are no changes to `y`, and the program continues executing beyond this point.***
