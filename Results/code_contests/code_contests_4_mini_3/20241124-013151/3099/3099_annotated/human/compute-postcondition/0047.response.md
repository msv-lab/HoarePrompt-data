Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, and `i` is equal to `plen`. If `p[i]` is '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur in `y`, and the program continues. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the program continues without changes to `y` or printing. Edge cases where `i` equals the length of `p` or `q` must be handled prior to this condition to prevent index errors.***
