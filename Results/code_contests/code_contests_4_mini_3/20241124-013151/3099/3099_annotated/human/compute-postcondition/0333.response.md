Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and if the character at index 2 of `p1` does not match the character at index 2 of `qr`, the program prints 'NO', assigns `False` to `y1`, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables involved in the condition.***
