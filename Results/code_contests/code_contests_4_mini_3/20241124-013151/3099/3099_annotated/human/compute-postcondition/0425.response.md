To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided information carefully.

1. The loop iterates over the range defined by `p1len`. To execute one more time, the current index `i` must be less than `p1len - 1` (since the range is 0 to `p1len - 1`).

2. We know that `i` is currently 1. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `p1len` must be greater than 1, which ensures `i` can increment to 2 in the next iteration.

3. The conditions regarding `y0`, `y1`, `p1`, `qr`, and `good_letters` are relevant to the loop's inner logic, but do not affect the iteration count or the index directly. They dictate what happens within the loop but not whether the loop itself continues to execute.

4. Since `p1len` is greater than 0 and `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `p1len` is at least 2 so that `i` can increment to 2 in the next iteration.

5. The values of `y0`, `y1`, `qr`, and the state of `p1` do not need to be changed for the next iteration to occur as they are not directly tied to the loop control variables.

Thus, we summarize the necessary adjustments:

- Ensure `p1len` is greater than 1, allowing `i` to become 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains False if either the character at index `i` in `p1` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p1[i]` does not match `qr[i]`. If `p1[i]` is a '?' but `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y1` remains unchanged. If `p1[i]` matches `qr[i]`, the execution continues without any changes to `y1`. `qr` remains the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1.`**
