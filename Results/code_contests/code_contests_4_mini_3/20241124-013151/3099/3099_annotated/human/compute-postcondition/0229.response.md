Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 2, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 2. If the character `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y1` or the output.***
