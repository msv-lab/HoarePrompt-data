The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables `plen`, `qlen`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. The output is still 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, `y` is False, and the output is 'NO'**
