The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` could have been either `True` or `False`, but after the assignment, it is now definitely `False`. The other variables (`y0`, `qr`, `p1len`, `i`) remain unchanged. The printed output 'NO' is also not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is still the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is still the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
