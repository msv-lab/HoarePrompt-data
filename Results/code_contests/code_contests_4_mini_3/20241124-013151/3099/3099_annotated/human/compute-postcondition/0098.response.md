Postcondition: ***If `plen` is greater than 0 and `y` is True, meaning all characters of `p` match the corresponding characters in `q` according to the defined rules, the output will be 'YES'. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True, leading to 'YES' being printed. If any matching condition fails during the loop execution, `y` is set to False and 'NO' is printed, thus ensuring that 'YES' is only printed when all conditions for matching are satisfied.***
