Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains False if either the character at index `i` (which is 1) in `p1` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p1[i]` does not match `qr[i]`. If `p1[i]` is a '?' but `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y1` remains unchanged. If `p1[i]` matches `qr[i]`, the execution continues without any changes to `y1`. In all cases, `qr` remains the reverse of `q`, and `p1len` is greater than 0.***
