The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y1` is False, `qr` is the string `q` reversed, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
