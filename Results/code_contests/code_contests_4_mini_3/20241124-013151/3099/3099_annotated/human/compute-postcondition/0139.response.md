Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `p[i]` is '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains unchanged. If `p[i]` is not '?', and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the program continues execution without modifying `y`. Overall, `y` will be False if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters` or if `p[i]` does not equal `q[i]`, else `y` remains unchanged.***
