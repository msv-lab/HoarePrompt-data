Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `y` is False, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `i` is 0, `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the function prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the function does not print anything and `y` remains True.***
