Postcondition: ***If `plen` is greater than 0 and `qlen` is equal to `plen` with all character checks passing, `y` is True and 'YES' is printed. If `plen` is 0 or `qlen` is less than `plen`, or if any character comparison fails resulting in `y` being set to False during the loop, then 'YES' is not printed and `y` remains unchanged.***
