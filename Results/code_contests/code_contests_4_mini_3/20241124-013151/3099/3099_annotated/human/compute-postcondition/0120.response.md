According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `plen`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `plen` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

After the current iteration, `i` will increment by 1 before the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1, and since `plen` is greater than 0, it is sufficient for `plen` to remain greater than 1 to allow for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted because the conditions regarding `p[i]` and `q[i]` do not affect the ability to execute the next iteration.

State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
