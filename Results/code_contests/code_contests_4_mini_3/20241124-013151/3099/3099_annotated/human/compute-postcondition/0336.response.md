Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and `i` is less than `p1len`. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute and `y1` remains True. If `p1len` is greater than 0, the loop checks each character in `p1` against the corresponding character in `qr`. If any character in `p1` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, it prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False. If any character in `p1` does not match the corresponding character in `qr`, it prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False. If neither of these conditions are met for all characters, the variables remain unchanged.**
