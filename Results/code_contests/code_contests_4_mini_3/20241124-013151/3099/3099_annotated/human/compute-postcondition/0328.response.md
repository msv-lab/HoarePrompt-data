The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 2, and the function prints 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
