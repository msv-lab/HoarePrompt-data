Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `y` is True, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, and `q` is an input string. If the length of `q` (qlen) is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, there is no change to the program state as the condition was not met.***
