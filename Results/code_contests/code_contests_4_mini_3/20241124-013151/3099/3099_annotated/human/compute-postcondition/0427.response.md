The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, which means it is explicitly set to `False`. The previous state of `y1` is unchanged, but since `y1` is now assigned `False`, it confirms that `y1` is indeed `False`. Other variables (`y0`, `qr`, `p1len`, and the output) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` remains the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'**
