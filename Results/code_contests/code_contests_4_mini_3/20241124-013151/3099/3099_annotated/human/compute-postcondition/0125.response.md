The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of `plen` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed to the console**
