The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This does not affect any of the variables, as it only produces an output. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `i` is equal to `plen`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `i` is equal to `plen`, and the output is 'NO'**
