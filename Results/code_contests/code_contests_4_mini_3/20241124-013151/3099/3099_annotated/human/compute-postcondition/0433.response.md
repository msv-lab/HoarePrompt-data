Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains False, and `qr` remains the reverse of `q`. If the character at index `i` in `p1` does not match the corresponding character in `qr`, 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` matches `qr[i]`, there are no changes to `y1`, and the program continues without breaking. This covers cases where `p1[i]` is a matching character, a '?' not corresponding to a good letter, or a mismatch that results in 'NO' being printed.***
