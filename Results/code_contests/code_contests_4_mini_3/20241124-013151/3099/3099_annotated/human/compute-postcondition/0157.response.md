The `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables, but it skips the current iteration of the loop it is contained in. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement. The output state remains unchanged, and we note that we are skipping to the next iteration.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
