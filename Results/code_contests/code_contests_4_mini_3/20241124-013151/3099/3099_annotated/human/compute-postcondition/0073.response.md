Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `y` is False if the element at index `i` of `p` is equal to '?' and the element at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters` (printing 'NO' and breaking out of the loop). If the element at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True and continues execution. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?' and is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False, breaking out of the loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y` remains True and nothing is printed.***
