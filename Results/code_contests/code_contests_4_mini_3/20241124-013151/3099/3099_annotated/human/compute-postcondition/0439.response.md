Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, and `y1` is either True or False. If `y1` is False, the loop skips to the next iteration without executing further checks. If `p1` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True. If `p1` has a length greater than 0 and contains at least one index `i` such that `p1[i]` is a '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or `p1[i]` does not match `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and the loop exits. Otherwise, the conditions do not lead to printing 'NO', and the state remains unchanged for the iteration. All conditions are consistent with `p1len` being greater than or equal to 0.***
