The value of `y` is set to `False`. The previous value of `y` was `True`, but it is now changed to `False`. The states of the other variables (`plen`, `i`, `n`, and the lists `p` and `q`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 0, the first element of the list `p` at index `i` is not equal to '?', and the first element of the list `p` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of the list `q` at index `i`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 0, the first element of the list `p` at index `i` is not equal to '?', and the first element of the list `p` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of the list `q` at index `i`, and 'NO' is printed.**
