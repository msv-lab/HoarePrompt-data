Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is '?', `y1` is False and 'NO' is printed if the character at index `i` of `qr` (the reversed string `q`) is not in `good_letters`. If the character at index `i` of `qr` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is not '?', `y1` is False and 'NO' is printed if the `i`-th character of `p1` does not match the `i`-th character of `qr`; otherwise, `y1` remains True if they match. This ensures that all characters are checked against the conditions set by `good_letters` and the corresponding characters in the reversed string `q`.***
