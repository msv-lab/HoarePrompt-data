Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, and `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1. If `p[i]` is a question mark (`?`), then if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and execution continues without changes. If `p[i]` is not a question mark, and if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, then `y` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing without breaking. All possible cases regarding the values of `p[i]` and `q[i]` are covered.***
