Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If the elements at index `i` of arrays `p` and `q` are not equal, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the elements at index `i` of arrays `p` and `q` are equal, the program continues execution without modifying `y`.***
