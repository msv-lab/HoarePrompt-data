Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, `p1len` remains unchanged, `p0len` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `qlen` remains unchanged. If the characters at index `i` (2) of `p0` and `q` are not equal, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop.***
