According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `plen`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `plen`, so if `i` is currently equal to the previous `i` + 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `plen` for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, and `plen` is greater than 0. This means that the new value of `i` should be the previous `i` + 1, which would be equal to the length of the range, making it necessary to adjust `plen` to be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `plen` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current value of `i`, which is now equal to the previous `i` + 1.

State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1**
