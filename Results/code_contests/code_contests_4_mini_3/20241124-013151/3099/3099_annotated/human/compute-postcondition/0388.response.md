Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, `p1len` remains unchanged, `p0len` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `qlen` remains unchanged, and if the character `q[i]` (where `i` is 2) is not found in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
