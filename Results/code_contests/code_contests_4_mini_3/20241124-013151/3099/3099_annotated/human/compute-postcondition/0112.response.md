Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `y` is False if the element at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, leading to a print of 'NO' and a break from the loop. If the element at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, then `y` remains True. The program execution will proceed based on the conditions established by the values in `q` and `good_letters`.***
