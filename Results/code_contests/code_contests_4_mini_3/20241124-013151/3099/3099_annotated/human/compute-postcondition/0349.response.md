Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`. The value of `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and `i` is less than `p1len`. If there is at least one character in `t` that is also in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues to the next iteration. If no characters in `t` are found in `good_letters`, the program continues without printing 'NO'.***
