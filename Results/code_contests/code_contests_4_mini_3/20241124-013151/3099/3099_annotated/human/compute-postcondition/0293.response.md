Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` is unchanged, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, and `good_letters` is unchanged. If the character at index `i` in `p0` is a question mark and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed and the loop is exited. If the character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is exited. Thus, the program handles the cases where `p0[i]` is a question mark or differs from `q[i]`.***
