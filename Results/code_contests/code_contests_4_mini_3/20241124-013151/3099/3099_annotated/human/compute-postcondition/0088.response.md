Postcondition: ***If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Given that `plen` is greater than 1, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, and `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, the state of `y` indicates that an invalid letter was found in `q`. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without any changes to `y` or output.***
