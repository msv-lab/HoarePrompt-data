Output State: **If `p0len` is greater than 0, then `y0` is either False (if any character at index `i` of `p0` is '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`), or remains True (if the characters match or if `p0[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`). If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain unchanged: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is unchanged, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, and `good_letters` is unchanged.**
