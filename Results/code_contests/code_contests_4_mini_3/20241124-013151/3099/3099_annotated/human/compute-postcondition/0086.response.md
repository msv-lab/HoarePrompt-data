The value of `y` is assigned `False`, and this does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 1, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is `False`.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is False**
