The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
