Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `p1` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, the output is 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, the program continues to execute without any changes to `y1` or output.***
