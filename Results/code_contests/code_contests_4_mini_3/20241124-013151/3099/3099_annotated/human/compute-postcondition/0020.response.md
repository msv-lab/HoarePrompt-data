Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `y` is set to False if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`. The loop is broken, indicating that the character at index `i` fails to meet the criteria. If the character is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and the program continues without any changes to `y` or other variables.***
