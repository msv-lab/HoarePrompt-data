The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, `qr`, `p1len`, and `i` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variable values along with the printed output.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is True or False depending on the evaluation of the conditions, `qr` is still the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
