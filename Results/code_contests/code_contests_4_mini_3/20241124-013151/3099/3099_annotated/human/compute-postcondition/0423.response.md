Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` remains the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and if the element at index `i` of `p1` does not match the element at index `i` of `qr`, then 'NO' is printed to the console and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, no changes occur to `y1`, and the program continues execution without breaking.***
