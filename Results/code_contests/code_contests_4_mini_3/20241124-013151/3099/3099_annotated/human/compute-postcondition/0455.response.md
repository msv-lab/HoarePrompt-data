Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, and `n` is an input string. If `n` is greater than 0, the program reads `n` input strings `q`. If `'*'` is not in `p`, for each `q`, if its length equals `plen` and all character conditions pass based on `p`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `plen` is 0, 'YES' is printed for each input string regardless of its content. If `'*'` is in `p`, for each `q`, if its length is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program checks the beginning of `q` against `p0` and the end of `q` against the reversed `p1`. 'YES' is printed only if both checks pass and the substring `t` does not contain any characters from `good_letters`. If `n` is 0, no input is read, and no output is generated. The output respects the checks for each condition, including cases where `n` is 0 or where `q` does not meet the expected conditions.***
