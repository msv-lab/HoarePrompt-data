Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False. If `p1len` is 0, then `t` is assigned the value of `q[p0len:]`, which is a slice of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end of `q`. If `p1len` is greater than 0, then `t` is assigned a slice of `q` from index `p0len` to index `-p1len`, which excludes the last `p1len` elements of `q`.***
