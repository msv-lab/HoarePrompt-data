Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `p0[i]` is '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the state remains unchanged. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and breaks; if they are equal, the state remains unchanged. This encapsulates all scenarios including edge cases where `q[i]` might be a good letter or when `p0[i]` and `q[i]` are identical or different.***
