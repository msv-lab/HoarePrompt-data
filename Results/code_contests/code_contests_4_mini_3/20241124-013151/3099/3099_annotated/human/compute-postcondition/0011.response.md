The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, we note that the program continues without changing the state of the variables involved.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, and the function prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
