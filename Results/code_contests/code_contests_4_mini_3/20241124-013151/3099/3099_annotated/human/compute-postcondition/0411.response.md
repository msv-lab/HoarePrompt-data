The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `y1` was `True`, but it is now changed to `False`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is `q` reversed, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, and the output is 'NO'**
