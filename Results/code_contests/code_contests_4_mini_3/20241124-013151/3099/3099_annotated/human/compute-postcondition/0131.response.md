The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The variables `plen` and `i` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not affect their values. Therefore, the output state is `plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'**
