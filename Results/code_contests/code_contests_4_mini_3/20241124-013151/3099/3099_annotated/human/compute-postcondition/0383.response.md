Postcondition: ***`y0` remains False, `y1` remains False, and the values of `p1len`, `p0len`, `t`, `good_letters`, `qr`, `i`, `n`, `q`, and `qlen` remain unchanged. If the character at position `i` (which is 1) in `p0` is a '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur, and the program continues execution. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This ensures that all cases regarding the character checks and mismatches between `p0` and `q` are handled appropriately.***
