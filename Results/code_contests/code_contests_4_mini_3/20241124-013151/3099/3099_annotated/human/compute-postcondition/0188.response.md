Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than or equal to 3, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is equal to `p0len`. If the character at position `i` in the string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, the variable `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at position `i` is in `good_letters`, no actions are taken in this block.***
