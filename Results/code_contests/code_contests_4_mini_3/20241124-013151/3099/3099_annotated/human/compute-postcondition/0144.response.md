Postcondition: ***If `y` is True, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that all conditions in the loop were satisfied without any contradictions. If `y` is False, 'YES' is not printed, reflecting that either `p[i]` did not match `q[i]`, or a character in `q` was not in `good_letters` when `p[i]` was '?', indicating a failure in the matching process. If `plen` is less than or equal to 0, `y` remains True and 'YES' is printed, as the loop does not execute and no mismatches are found.***
