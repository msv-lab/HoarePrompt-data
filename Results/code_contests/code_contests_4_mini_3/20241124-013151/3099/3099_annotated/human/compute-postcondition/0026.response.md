Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y` is set to False, and the program prints 'NO' if the character at index `i` of `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`. The loop is exited if this condition is met, while if the characters are equal, the program continues without any changes to `y` or other variables.***
