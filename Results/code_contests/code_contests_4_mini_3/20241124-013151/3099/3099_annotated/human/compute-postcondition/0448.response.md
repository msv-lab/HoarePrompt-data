The values of the variables do not change because the `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration without altering any variable states. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False, and 'NO' is printed while we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False, and 'NO' is printed while we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
