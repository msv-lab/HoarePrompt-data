The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered, so `plen` remains greater than 1, `i` is still 1, and 'NO' is printed to the console. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is False.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is False**
