The value of `y` is assigned `False`. The initial state indicates that `plen` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1, while the output is 'NO'. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `y` is False, and the output remains 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `y` is False, and the output is 'NO'**
