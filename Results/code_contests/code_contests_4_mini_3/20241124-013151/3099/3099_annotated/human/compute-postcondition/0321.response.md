The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, which is already its current value; hence no change occurs in the program state. The other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed.**
