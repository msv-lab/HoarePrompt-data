Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y1` is False if the `i`-th character of `p1` is not equal to the `i`-th character of `qr`, where `qr` is the string `q` reversed; otherwise, `y1` remains True if the characters match or if the comparison does not occur. The variable `i` is 0, and the `i`-th character of `p1` is not '?'. This captures the condition of breaking out of the loop upon finding a mismatch or continuing if they match.***
