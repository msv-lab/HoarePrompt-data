Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, and `q` is an input string of length `qlen`. If the character at position `i` (which is equal to `plen`) in `q` is not found in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y`, and the program continues executing without interruption.***
