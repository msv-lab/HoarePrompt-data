The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one. In this case, the values of the variables do not change as a result of the `continue` statement. The state of the variables remains unchanged, but we indicate that we are skipping to the next iteration in the loop.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is unchanged, `p0len` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
