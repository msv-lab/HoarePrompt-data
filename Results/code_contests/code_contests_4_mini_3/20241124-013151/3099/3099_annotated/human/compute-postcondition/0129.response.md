Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the program continues without changes to `y` or any output.***
