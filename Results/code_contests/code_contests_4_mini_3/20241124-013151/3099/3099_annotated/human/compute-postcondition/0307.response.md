Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, and since the element at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?', if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the variables remain unchanged.***
