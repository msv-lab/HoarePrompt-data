According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` relative to `plen`. Since `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1 at the end of the last iteration, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `plen`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is greater than 1, and `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to its current value (which is previous `i` + 1) and must be less than `plen`. 

So, if we assume the previous `i` was `k`, then `i` is now `k + 1`. Since `plen` is greater than 1, `plen` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `plen` is still greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`plen` is greater than `k + 1`, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is `k + 1`**
