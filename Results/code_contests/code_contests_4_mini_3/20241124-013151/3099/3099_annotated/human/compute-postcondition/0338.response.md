The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration. Since the previous values indicate that `y1` remains False and `i` is less than `p1len`, the values of other variables are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is less than `p1len`, and `y1` remains False while skipping the current iteration.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `good_letters` is unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is less than `p1len`, and `y1` remains False while skipping the current iteration.**
