Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is at least 0, `p0len` is 0, `t` is equal to `q` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is a substring of `q`, `good_letters` remains unchanged, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is less than `p1len`, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`. If the length of `q` is less than `plen - 1`, the output will be 'NO' and the program will continue to the next iteration or statement. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, the program continues without outputting 'NO'.***
