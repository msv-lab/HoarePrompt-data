Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is equal to `p0len`. If `p0[i]` is equal to '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is equal to '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur to `y0`, and the program continues execution. If `p0[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p0[i]` does not equal `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p0[i]` equals `q[i]`, the program continues without any changes to `y0` or output.***
