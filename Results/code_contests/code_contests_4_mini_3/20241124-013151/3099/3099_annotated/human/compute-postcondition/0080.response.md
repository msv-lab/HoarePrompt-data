The value of `y` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous state from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`plen`, `qlen`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, `y` is False, and 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to the length of `q`, `i` is equal to the previous `i` + 1, `y` is False, and 'NO' has been printed.**
