The variable `p` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts user input. The `good_letters` variable remains unaffected since the input operation does not change its state. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, and `p` is an input string.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, and `p` is an input string**
