Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `y` is set to False and 'NO' is printed if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters` (if `p[i]` is '?') or if the character at index `i` of `p` is different from the character at index `i` of `q` (else case). If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters` and the characters at index `i` of `p` and `q` are equal, then `y` remains True and the program continues without any changes to `y` or other variables.***
