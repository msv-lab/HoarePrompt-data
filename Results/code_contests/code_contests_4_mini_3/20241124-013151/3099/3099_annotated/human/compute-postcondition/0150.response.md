The length of the substring `p0` is calculated and assigned to `p0len`. The variable `p0len` is now defined based on the length of `p0`, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the value of `p0len` which is the length of `p0`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is an input string, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*' reversed, and `p0len` is the length of `p0`**.
