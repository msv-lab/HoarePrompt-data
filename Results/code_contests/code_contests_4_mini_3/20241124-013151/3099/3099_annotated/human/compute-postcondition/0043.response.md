The code executes a print statement, which outputs 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial conditions of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `i` is equal to `plen`, and 'NO' is printed.**
