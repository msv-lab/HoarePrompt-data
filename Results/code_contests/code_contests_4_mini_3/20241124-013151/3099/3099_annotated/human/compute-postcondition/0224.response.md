Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 1. If `p1[i]` is '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is '?', but `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without changes to `y1` or output. If `p1[i]` is not '?', and `p1[i]` does not match `qr[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` matches `qr[i]`, the program continues executing without any changes to `y1` or output. Thus, `y1` will only be set to False if a mismatch occurs when `p1[i]` is not '?' or if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters` when `p1[i]` is '?'.***
