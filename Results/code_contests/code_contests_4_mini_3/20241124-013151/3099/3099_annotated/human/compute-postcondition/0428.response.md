The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` remains the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO' while we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
