Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the first element of the list `p` at index `i` is not equal to '?'. If the element `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and exits the inner loop or statement; otherwise, there are no changes to `y` or any other variables.***
