Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes `n` times, and for each iteration, if `qlen` equals `plen` and all character checks pass, 'YES' is printed. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, or any character comparison fails (either due to `p[i]` not matching `q[i]`, or `q[i]` not being in `good_letters` when `p[i]` is '?'), 'NO' is printed instead. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated. If `plen` is 0, then regardless of `n`, 'YES' is printed since the character checks do not apply. Therefore, the values of `y` remain unchanged, and there is no comparison needed.**
