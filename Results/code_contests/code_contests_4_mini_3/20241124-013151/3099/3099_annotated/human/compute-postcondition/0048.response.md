According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `plen`. The loop iterates from `0` to `plen - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `plen`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations and will not execute again as it is set to iterate only while `i` is less than `plen`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `plen + 1`, which is beyond the current bounds of the loop. However, since the loop cannot execute again once `i` reaches `plen`, it indicates that the loop has finished its iterations and cannot continue. 

Thus, there are no states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop is already at the end of its execution.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is greater than 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, and `i` is equal to `plen`**
