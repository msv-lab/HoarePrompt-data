To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
1. If the length of the string `S` is at most `K`, print `S` without change.
2. If the length of `S` exceeds `K`, extract the first `K` characters in `S`, append `...` to the end, and print the result.
3. Constraints:
   - `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - The length of `S` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

### Program Code:
```python
input = iter(sys.stdin.readlines()).next

def func_1():
    K = int(input())
    S = input().strip()
    if len(S) <= K:
        print(S)
    else:
        print(S[:K] + '...')
    return 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
    func_1()
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - `K` is read as an integer.
   - `S` is read as a string and any leading/trailing whitespace is stripped.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program checks if the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`. If true, it prints `S`.
   - If the length of `S` exceeds `K`, it prints the first `K` characters of `S` followed by `...`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Length of S**: If `S` has a length of 1 and `K` is also 1, the output should be `S` which is correct.
2. **Maximum Length of S**: If `S` has a length of 100 and `K` is 100, the output should be `S` which is also correct.
3. **When K is less than Length of S**: For various values of `K` (e.g., `K=5` and `S='abcdefghij'`), the output should be `abcde...`, which the program correctly handles.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements as stated in the problem description. It handles all edge cases appropriately and follows the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly prints the string `S` as specified based on its length in relation to `K`.
