Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. It reads an integer K from the input.
2. It reads a string S from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace (though the problem specifies that S will consist of lowercase letters without whitespace).
3. It checks the length of S:
   - If the length of S is less than or equal to K, it prints S unchanged.
   - If the length of S exceeds K, it extracts the first K characters of S and appends '...' to the end, then prints the result.

The program handles all specified constraints correctly:
- K is within the range of 1 to 100.
- S is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100.

All test cases provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program. For example:
- When K is 7 and S is "nikoandsolstice", the output is "nikoand..." as expected.
- When K is 40 and S is "ferelibenterhominesidquodvoluntcredunt", the output is the same as S because its length does not exceed K.

Since all potential cases that abide by the constraints are covered, I conclude that the program is correct.
