The value of `K` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `S` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `K` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output State: **`K` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters**
