The code prints the first `K` characters of the string `S`, followed by an ellipsis (`...`). The variable `S` is an input string, and its length is greater than `K`, so the operation `S[:K]` will yield the first `K` characters of `S`. The output state will include the unchanged values of `K` and `S`, as well as the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`K` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `S` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and the output is `S[:K] + '...'`.**
