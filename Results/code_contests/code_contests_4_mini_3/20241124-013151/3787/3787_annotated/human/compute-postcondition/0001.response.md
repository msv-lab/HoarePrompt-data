The variable `S` is assigned the value of the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state of `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, but after the `input()` function is called, it will take a new value based on user input. The integer `K` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `K` is an input integer between 1 and 100, and `S` is now an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`K` is an input integer between 1 and 100, and `S` is now an input string after stripping whitespace**
