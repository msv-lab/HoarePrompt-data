Postcondition: ***`K` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `S` is a string with no leading or trailing whitespace. If the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`, the function prints `S`. Otherwise, if the length of `S` exceeds `K`, the function prints the first `K` characters of `S` followed by '...'.***
