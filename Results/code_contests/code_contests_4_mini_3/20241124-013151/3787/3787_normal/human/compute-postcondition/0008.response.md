The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `K` and `S`. `K` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100 (inclusive). After executing the function body, it always returns 0, regardless of the values of `K` and `S`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `K` and a string `S`, and always return 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters K (an integer between 1 and 100) and S (a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100), and always returns 0.**
