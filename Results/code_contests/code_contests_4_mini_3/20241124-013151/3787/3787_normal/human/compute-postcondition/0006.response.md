Postcondition: ***`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `S` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100 (inclusive). If the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`, then the output is the full string `S`. If the length of `S` is greater than `K`, then the output is the first `K` characters of `S` followed by '...'.***
