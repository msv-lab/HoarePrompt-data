The code prints the first `K` characters of the string `S` followed by an ellipsis ('...'). The variable `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and its length is greater than `K`. Therefore, `S[:K]` takes the first `K` characters of `S`. The output does not change the values of `K` or `S`, but it produces a formatted string.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `S` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than K, and the output is the first K characters of S followed by '...'**
