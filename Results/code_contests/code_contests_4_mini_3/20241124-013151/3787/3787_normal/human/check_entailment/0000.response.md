Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
1. If the length of string S is at most K, print S without change.
2. If the length of S exceeds K, extract the first K characters in S, append `...` to the end of them, and print the result.
3. Constraints are given for K (1 to 100) and the length of S (1 to 100).

### Program Code:
```python
import sys
input = iter(sys.stdin.readlines()).next
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
    func_1()
input = iter(sys.stdin.readlines()).next

def func_1():
    K = int(input())
    S = input().strip()
    if len(S) <= K:
        print(S)
    else:
        print(S[:K] + '...')
    return 0
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
    func_1()
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts an integer input K (between 1 and 100) and a string S (of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100). It prints the full string S if its length is less than or equal to K; otherwise, it prints the first K characters of S followed by '...'. The function always returns 0.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program correctly reads the integer K and the string S.
2. It checks the length of S against K:
   - If `len(S) <= K`, it prints S.
   - If `len(S) > K`, it prints the first K characters followed by `...`.
3. The program seems to be structured correctly according to the problem description.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- **Minimum Length S**: If S is of length 1 and K is also 1, it should return S (which is valid).
- **Exact Length**: If S is of length K, it should return S without change.
- **Just Over K**: If S has a length of K+1, it should return the first K characters followed by `...`.
- **Maximum Length**: If S is 100 characters long and K is 100, it should return S without change.
- **Single Character Cases**: If K is 1, and S is longer than 1, it should return only the first character followed by `...`.

### Confirmation with Output Hints:
The output hints align with the code's logic:
- They confirm that the function will print S if `len(S) <= K`.
- They also confirm that it will print the first K characters plus `...` if `len(S) > K`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles all specified cases and adheres to constraints.

Thus, after reviewing the code, the description, and the output hints,

Correctness: **True**.
