The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s0` can be either 1 or 2, so after the execution, `s0` will be either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables (`S`, `c`, and `s1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of length greater than 2, `c` is the third character in the string, `s0` is either 2 or 3, and `s1` is 0 or 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length greater than 2, `c` is the third character in the string, `s0` is either 2 or 3, `s1` is 0 or 1**
