Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `s0` is incremented by 1 if the first character `c` is '0', and `s1` remains 0. If `c` is '1', then `s0` remains 0 and `s1` is incremented by 1. Thus, after the execution, either `s0` is 1 and `s1` is 0 (if `c` is '0') or `s0` is 0 and `s1` is 1 (if `c` is '1').**
