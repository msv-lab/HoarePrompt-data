The value of `s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` can either be 0 or 1, so after the execution, `s1` can be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables, `S`, `c`, and `s0`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of length greater than 2, `c` is the third character in the string, `s0` is 1 or 2, and `s1` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length greater than 2, `c` is the third character in the string, `s0` is 1 or 2, `s1` is either 1 or 2**
