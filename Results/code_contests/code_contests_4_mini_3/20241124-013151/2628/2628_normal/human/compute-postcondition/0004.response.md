The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s0` is 0, so after the execution, `s0` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`S`, `s1`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `s0` is 1, and `s1` is 0.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0**
