Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length greater than 2, `c` is the third character of `S`. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is incremented to either 2 or 3. Otherwise, if `c` is not '0', then `s1` is incremented to either 1 or 2. Therefore, after the execution of the program fragment, if `c` is '0', `s0` will be 2 or 3 and `s1` will remain 0 or 1; if `c` is not '0', `s0` can be 1 or 2, and `s1` will be 1 or 2.***
