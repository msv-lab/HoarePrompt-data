Output State: **`s0` is the count of '0' characters in string `S`, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in string `S`. If `S` is a non-empty string containing only '0's, then `s0` is equal to the length of `S` and `s1` is 0. If `S` is a non-empty string containing only '1's, then `s0` is 0 and `s1` is equal to the length of `S`. If `S` is an empty string, then the loop does not execute, and both `s0` and `s1` remain 0.**
