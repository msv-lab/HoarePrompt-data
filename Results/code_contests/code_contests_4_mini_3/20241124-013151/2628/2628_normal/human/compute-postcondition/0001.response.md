The variables `s0` and `s1` are both initialized to `0`. The previous values of `s0` and `s1` were not defined before this line of code, so they both start from `0` as per the current assignment. The state of the string `S` is not affected by this line. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 100,000; `s0` is 0, `s1` is 0**
