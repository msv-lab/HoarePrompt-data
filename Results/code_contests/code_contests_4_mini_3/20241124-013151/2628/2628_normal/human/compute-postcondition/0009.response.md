The value of `s0` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s0` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, the new value of `s0` could be 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`S` is a string of length greater than 1, `s0` is either 1 or 2, `s1` is 0 or 1, `c` is the second character in `S`**
