The value of `s1` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1. Therefore, after execution, `s1` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, `c` is '0' or '1', `s0` is 2, `s1` is 2.

Output State: **`S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, `c` is '0' or '1', `s0` is 2, `s1` is 2**
