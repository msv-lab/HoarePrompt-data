The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`. `S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1', with a length such that 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100,000. The specific output and behavior of the function are not provided, but based on the parameter description, we can infer that the function processes the string `S` and returns a result based on its content. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter S, which is a string of '0' and '1' characters with a length between 1 and 100,000.**
