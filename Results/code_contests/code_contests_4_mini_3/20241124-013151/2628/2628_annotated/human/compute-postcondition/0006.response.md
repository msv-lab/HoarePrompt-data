The value of `s1` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0, so after execution, `s1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables `S`, `s0`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, and `c` is '1'.

Output State: **`S` is a string of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, and `c` is '1'**
