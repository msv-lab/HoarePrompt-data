Output State: **`s0` is the count of '0's in string `S`, `s1` is the count of '1's in string `S`. If `S` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `s0` and `s1` remain 0. If `S` contains at least one character, the loop will execute for the length of `S`, incrementing `s0` or `s1` based on the characters in `S`.**
