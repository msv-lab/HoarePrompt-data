The value of `s1` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0, so after execution, `s1` is now 1. The values of the other variables, `S` and `s0`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, `s0` is 1, `s1` is 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, `s0` is 1, `s1` is 1**
