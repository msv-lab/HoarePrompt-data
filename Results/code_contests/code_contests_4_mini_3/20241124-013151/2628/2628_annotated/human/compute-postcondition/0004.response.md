The value of `s0` is incremented by 1, and since `s0` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The values of `S`, `s1`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0, and the first character `c` of `S` is '0'.

Output State: **`S` is a string of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0, and the first character `c` of `S` is '0'**
