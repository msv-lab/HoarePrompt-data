The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s0` is 2, so after execution, `s0` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, `c` is '0' or '1', `s0` is 3, `s1` is 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, `c` is '0' or '1', `s0` is 3, `s1` is 1**
