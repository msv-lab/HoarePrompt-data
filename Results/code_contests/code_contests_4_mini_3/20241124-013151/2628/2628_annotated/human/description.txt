You are given a string S consisting of `0` and `1`. Find the maximum integer K not greater than |S| such that we can turn all the characters of S into `0` by repeating the following operation some number of times.

* Choose a contiguous segment [l,r] in S whose length is at least K (that is, r-l+1\geq K must be satisfied). For each integer i such that l\leq i\leq r, do the following: if S_i is `0`, replace it with `1`; if S_i is `1`, replace it with `0`.

Constraints

* 1\leq |S|\leq 10^5
* S_i(1\leq i\leq N) is either `0` or `1`.
