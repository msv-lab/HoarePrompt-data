n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000. Each operation consists of either painting a row or a column, where the row index ri satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ n and the column index ci satisfies 1 ≤ ci ≤ m, and ai is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
