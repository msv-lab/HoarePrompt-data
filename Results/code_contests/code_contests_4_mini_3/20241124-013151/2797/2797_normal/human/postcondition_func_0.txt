The function accepts no parameters and initializes a 2D list of size `n x m` with zeros. It then processes up to `k` operations that either set all elements in a specified row or column to a given value. If `k` is 0 at the start, the list remains unchanged. If invalid indices are provided for rows or columns, it may result in an indexing error. Finally, the function prints the modified 2D list.
