According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must have been at least 1 before the decrement, meaning that it should currently be greater than 0.

Since `k` is a positive integer and has been decreased by 1, it must have been at least 1 before the last iteration, which means that `k` should currently be at least 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned integer values from user input**
