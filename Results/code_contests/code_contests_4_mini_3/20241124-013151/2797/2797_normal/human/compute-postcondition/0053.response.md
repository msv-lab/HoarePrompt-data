The statement `l[b - 1][i] = c` assigns the value of `c` to the specific location in the list `l` at the index `b - 1` and column `i`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i` do not affect this operation directly. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input from the user, but their specific values are not known. The operation updates the list `l` at the specified index.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are new integer values from user input, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are new integer values from user input, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
