According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `m` must be at least 1, since the `range(m)` function generates a sequence from 0 to `m-1`. With `n`, `m` as positive integers, and `k` having been decreased by 1, we need to ensure that `m` remains positive. Additionally, `i` will start from 0 at the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, the states should be adjusted as follows: `m` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0 before the loop starts executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input, `c` is an integer from user input, `i` is 0**
