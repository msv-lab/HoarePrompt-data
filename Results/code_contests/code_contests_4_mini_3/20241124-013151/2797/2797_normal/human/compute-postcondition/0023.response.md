Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, and `l` is a 2D list of size n x m. If `a` is 1 and `1 <= b <= n`, all elements in row `b - 1` of `l` are set to `c`. If `a` is 1 and `b` is outside the range [1, n], `l` remains unchanged as a 2D list of 0s. If `a` is not 1 and `1 <= b <= m`, all elements in column `b - 1` of `l` are set to `c`. If `a` is not 1 and `b` is outside the range [1, m], an indexing error occurs. In all cases, the size and structure of `l` remain as a 2D list of size n x m.***
