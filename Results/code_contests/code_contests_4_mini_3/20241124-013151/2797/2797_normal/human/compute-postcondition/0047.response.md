The line of code assigns new integer values to `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input, where the input values are split and converted into integers. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be overwritten by the new input values. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged aside from `k`, which has been stated to be decreased by 1 prior to this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with `n`, `m`, and the updated value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are the new integer values from user input, `k` is decreased by 1**
