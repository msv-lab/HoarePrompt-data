The code assigns the value of `c` to `l[b - 1][i]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `l[b - 1][0]`, which is already assigned the value of `c`, and `i`, which is 1. Therefore, the value of `l[b - 1][1]` is now set to `c`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input, `c` is an integer from user input, `i` is 1, and `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
