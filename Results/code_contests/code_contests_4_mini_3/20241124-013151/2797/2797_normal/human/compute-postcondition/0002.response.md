The code iterates over a 2D list `l` of size `n x m`, where each element is initially 0. The nested loops will print each element of the list in a row-wise manner, with the elements of the same row printed on the same line followed by a newline for the next row. However, since printing does not change the state of the variables, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `l` is a 2D list of size n x m filled with 0s, and the elements of `l` are printed row-wise.**
