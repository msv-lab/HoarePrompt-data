The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, so the new value of `k` will now be one less than that. The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 99999, and `l` is a 2D list of size n x m filled with 0s.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 99999, `l` is a 2D list of size n x m filled with 0s**
