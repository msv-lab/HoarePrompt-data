Output State: **`l[b - 1][0]` to `l[b - 1][m - 1]` are all assigned the value of `c`. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the list `l` remains unchanged. If `b` is less than 1 or greater than the number of rows in `l`, it results in an index error. Thus, for valid execution, `b` must be between 1 and the number of rows in `l`, and `m` must be greater than 0.**
