According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which is less than `m`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

Since `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, it is guaranteed that `m` is at least 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted from 0 to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 99999, `l` is a 2D list of size n x m filled with 0s, `a` is equal to 1, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1; the element at position `l[b - 1][0]` is assigned the value `c`.**
