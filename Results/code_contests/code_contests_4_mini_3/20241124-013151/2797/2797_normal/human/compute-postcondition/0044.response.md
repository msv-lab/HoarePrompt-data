Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers; `k` is decreased by 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned integer values from user input. If `a` is equal to 1 and `b` is within the valid range (between 1 and the number of rows in `l`), then the elements `l[b - 1][0]` to `l[b - 1][m - 1]` are assigned the value of `c`, provided that `m` is greater than 0; otherwise, the list `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to 1 and `b` is within the valid range, then the elements `l[0][b - 1]` to `l[n - 1][b - 1]` are assigned the value of `c` for `n` iterations, provided that `n` is less than or equal to the number of rows in `l` and greater than 0; if `n` is 0, the list remains unchanged. In both cases, if `b` is out of the valid range or if `m` or `n` are such that they would lead to index errors, an index error may occur.***
