Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, and `k` is greater than 0. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is greater than 0, then the first `m` elements of the list `l` at index `b - 1` are assigned the value `c`, while `k` is decreased by 1 and remains greater than 0. If `m` is 0, no changes are made to `l`, and `k` is still decreased by 1 and remains greater than 0. If `a` is not equal to 1, and if `n` is at least 1, then the first `n` elements of the list `l` at index `b - 1` are assigned the value `c`. If `n` is 0, no changes are made to `l`. Note that if `b` is out of the valid index range for the sublists in `l`, an error will occur. In all cases, `k` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than 0.***
