To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variable `k`, as it directly influences the loop's continuation condition `k > 0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state indicates that:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `k` is greater than 0.

Since the `while` loop checks if `k` is greater than 0, and we know that `k` is already greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time without needing any modifications to the state.

Thus, we can repeat the program state from the end of the previous iteration without any adjustments.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, and `k` is greater than 0**.
