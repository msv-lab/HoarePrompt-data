The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is split and converted into integers. The constraints indicate that `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 5000, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000. Other variables are not affected by this operation, so the output state reflects the newly assigned values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000**
