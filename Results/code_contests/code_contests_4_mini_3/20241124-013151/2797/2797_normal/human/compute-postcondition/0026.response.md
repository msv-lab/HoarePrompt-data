The line of code `a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unaffected directly, but `k` is noted as having been decreased by 1 prior to this line of code. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` depend on the user's input.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `k` (with `k` being one less than its original value) and acknowledges that `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on user input.

Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers; `k` is decreased by 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned integer values from user input.**
