According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is still a positive integer. Therefore, it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, and `l` is a 2D list of size n x m**
