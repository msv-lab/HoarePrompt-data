The value of `k` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is greater than 0, so the new value of `k` will still be positive. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned integer values from user input, and `k` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned integer values from user input, and `k` is decreased by 1**
