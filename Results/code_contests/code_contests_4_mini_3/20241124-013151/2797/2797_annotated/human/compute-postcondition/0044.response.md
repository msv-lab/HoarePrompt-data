Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s, `k` has been decremented by 1, and `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is greater than 0, then after executing the loop `m` times, `l[b - 1]` will be filled with `c` for indices `0` to `m - 1`. If `m` is 0 or less, `l[b - 1]` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to 1, and if `n` is greater than 0, then after executing the loop, `l` will have `c` set at positions [0][b - 1], [1][b - 1], ..., up to [n-1][b - 1]. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains unchanged. In all cases, `k` remains a positive integer decremented by 1.***
