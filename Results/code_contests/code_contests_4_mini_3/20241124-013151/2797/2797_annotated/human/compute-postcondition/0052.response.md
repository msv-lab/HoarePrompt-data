According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. There are no other states that need to be adjusted since `m` remains greater than 1 in this case.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `l` has been updated at position [b - 1][1] to the value of `c`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2**
