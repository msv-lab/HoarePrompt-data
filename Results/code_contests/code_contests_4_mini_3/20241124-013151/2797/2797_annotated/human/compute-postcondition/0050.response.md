According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Additionally, since `m` is greater than 0, it is possible for `m` to remain unchanged in this case.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `l` has been updated at position [b - 1][0] to the value of `c`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1**
