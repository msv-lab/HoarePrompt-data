To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `k > 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `k` has already been decremented by 1 and remains a positive integer. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the condition of the loop execution.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k` is greater than 1, `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s, `k` has been decremented by 1, and `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers.**
