Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers within their specified ranges, and `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s. If `a` equals 1 and `m` is greater than 0, then the elements `l[b - 1][0]` through `l[b - 1][m - 1]` are set to the value of `c`. If `a` equals 1 and `m` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to 1 and `n` is at least 1, then `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c` for `i` from 0 to `n - 1`. If `a` is not equal to 1 and `n` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. In all cases, the indices accessed in `l` are valid given the constraints on `b`, `m`, and `n`.***
