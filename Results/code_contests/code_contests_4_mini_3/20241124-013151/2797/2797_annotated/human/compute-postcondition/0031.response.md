According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `m` must be at least 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`**
