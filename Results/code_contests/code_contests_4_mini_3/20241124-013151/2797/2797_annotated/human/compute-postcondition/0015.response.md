According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, it ensures that the loop can execute at least once when `n` is 1 or greater. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will initialize to 0, representing the first iteration of the loop. To ensure the loop can execute, the current states are sufficient as `n` is a positive integer.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted, and we can state the current values:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` - 1 ≤ 99999, `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s, `a` is an integer not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are input integers from raw input, `i` is 0**
