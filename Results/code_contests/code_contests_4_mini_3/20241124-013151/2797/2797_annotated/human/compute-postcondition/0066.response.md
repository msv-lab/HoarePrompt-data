To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop statement. The loop condition is `k > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `n`, `m`, `k` are greater than 0, and `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s. 

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. 
2. **Current State**: Since `k` is stated to be greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration, this means the loop can indeed execute again.

No adjustments are needed for any other variables (n, m, l) since they do not influence the loop's ability to execute one more time in this specific context.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, and `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s.**
