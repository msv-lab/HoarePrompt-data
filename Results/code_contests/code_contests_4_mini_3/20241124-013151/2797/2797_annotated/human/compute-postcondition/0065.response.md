Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are greater than 0, and `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s. If `a` is equal to 1, then for all valid indices `b - 1`, all elements `l[b - 1][i]` for `i` in the range 0 to `m - 1` are set to `c`. If `m` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `b - 1` is out of bounds, an index error occurs. If `a` is not equal to 1, then for all valid indices `b - 1`, all elements `l[i][b - 1]` for `i` in the range 0 to `n - 1` are set to `c`. If `n` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `b` is out of bounds, an index error occurs. In both cases, if the loop does not execute due to `m` or `n` being 0, `l` remains a 2D list filled with 0s.***
