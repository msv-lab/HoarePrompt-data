To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current values of the variables involved in the loop.

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `m`. The current iteration variable `i` is 2.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.
3. Given that `m` is greater than 1 (as stated), and `i` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again (i.e., `i` needs to be less than `m`).
4. After the current iteration, `i` will increment by 1, resulting in `i` being 3 at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute again, we must adjust the state such that `m` is at least 3, and `i` is set to 3.

Based on this reasoning, the adjusted state will be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `i` is 3, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
