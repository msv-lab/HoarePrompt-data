According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1. Therefore, the state of `i` should be adjusted to 1. The value of `m` remains unchanged, as it is still greater than 1 (since it is greater than 0). 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `i` is 1, and the value of `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
