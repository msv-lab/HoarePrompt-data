The provided code snippet is a nested loop that iterates through a 2D list `l` of size `n` by `m` and prints each element without any additional formatting. The initial state specifies that `l` is filled with 0s.

Here's the step-by-step impact of the code:

1. The outer loop iterates over the range of `n`, meaning it will execute `n` times.
2. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates over the range of `m`, executing `m` times.
3. Each element `l[i][j]` is printed, and since `l` is filled with 0s, each printed value will be `0`.

Since the loop will print `m` zeros for each of the `n` rows, the total output will consist of `n` lines, each containing `m` zeros.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables and the printed result:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100000; `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s, printed as `m` zeros per row for `n` rows.**
