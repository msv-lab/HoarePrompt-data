The value of `k` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. Other variables `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` - 1 ≤ 99999; `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` - 1 ≤ 99999; `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s**
