The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since `k` is a positive integer, its new value will be one less than its previous value. The values of `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s, and `k` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `l` is a 2D list filled with 0s, and `k` is decremented by 1**
