The statement `l[b - 1][i] = c` assigns the value of `c` to the specific location in the list `l` at index `b - 1` and `i`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. The only change is in the list `l`, where the value at `l[b - 1][i]` now becomes `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `l[b - 1][i]` is now assigned the value of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`**
