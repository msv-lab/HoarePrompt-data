The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. The variable `b` is greater than 0, which means `b - 1` is a valid index for the first dimension of the list `l`. The variable `i` is 0, so it targets the first column of the row indexed by `b - 1`. The 2D list `l` is initially filled with 0s, and since `c` is an input integer, we replace the value at that position in the list with the value of `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the 2D list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `l` has been updated at position [b - 1][0] to the value of `c`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 0**
