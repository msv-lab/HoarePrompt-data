The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string and then splits it to convert into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` can be any integers within the specified ranges. The states of the variables are not affected by this code aside from the assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `k` are now defined as integers within their respective ranges.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100000.**
