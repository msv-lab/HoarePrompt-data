According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will need to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `l` has `c` at position [1][b - 1], `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2**
