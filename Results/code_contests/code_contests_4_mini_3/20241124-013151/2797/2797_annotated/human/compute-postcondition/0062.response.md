The value of `l[i][b - 1]` is updated to `c`. Since `i` is 2 and `b` is an input integer, the expression `b - 1` is valid, and `l[2][b - 1]` will now hold the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `l[0][b - 1]` is c, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `l[1][b - 1]` is updated to c, and `l[2][b - 1]` is now c.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `l[0][b - 1]` is c, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `l[1][b - 1]` is updated to c, `l[2][b - 1]` is now c**
