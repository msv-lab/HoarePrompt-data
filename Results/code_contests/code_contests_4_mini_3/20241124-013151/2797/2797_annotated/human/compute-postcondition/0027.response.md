According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are all positive integers, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 at the beginning of the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `i` is 0**
