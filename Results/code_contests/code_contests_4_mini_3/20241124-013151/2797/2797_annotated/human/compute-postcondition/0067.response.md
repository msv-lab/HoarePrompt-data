Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers within their specified ranges. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop executes up to `k` times, decrementing `k` by 1 each time. For each iteration, `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers. If `a` equals 1 and `b - 1` is a valid index (0 to `n-1`), then elements `l[b - 1][0]` through `l[b - 1][m - 1]` are set to the value of `c` if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to 1 and `b - 1` is a valid index (0 to `m-1`), then elements `l[0][b - 1]` through `l[n - 1][b - 1]` are set to `c` if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `b` is out of bounds (less than 1 or greater than `n`/`m`), an index error occurs. The loop does not execute if `k` is 0, and `l` remains a 2D list filled with 0s in that case. After the loop, if it executed, `k` is decremented to `0`.**
