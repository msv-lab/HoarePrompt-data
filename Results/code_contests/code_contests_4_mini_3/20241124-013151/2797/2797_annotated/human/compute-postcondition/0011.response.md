The variable `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. The previous values tell us that `c` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `c` ≤ 5000) and `i` is equal to 2. The initial state indicates that `l[b - 1][0]` and `l[b - 1][1]` have been assigned the value of `c`, but we do not have specific values for `b` and `c`, only that they are positive integers. Thus, the assignment will modify the third position (index 2) of the list `l[b - 1]` to hold the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` - 1 ≤ 99999; `l[b - 1][0]` is c; `l[b - 1][1]` is c; `l[b - 1][2]` is c; `a` is 1; `b` and `c` are input integers; `i` is 2**
