Output State: **`l` is updated such that all elements `l[i][b - 1]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1` are set to `c`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains unchanged, with all elements still being 0. `b` must be a valid index within the bounds of the columns of `l` (i.e., `b` should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the number of columns in `l`). If `b` is out of bounds, it will cause an index error when accessing `l[i][b - 1]`.**
