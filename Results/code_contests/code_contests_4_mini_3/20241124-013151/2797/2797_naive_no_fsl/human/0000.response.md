Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that when a cell is painted multiple times, the most recent operation (either row or column) should determine the final color of that cell.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the case with the following input:
```
3 3 3
1 1 3
2 2 1
1 2 2
```
According to the operations:
1. Paint row 1 with color 3. The table becomes:
   ```
   3 3 3
   0 0 0
   0 0 0
   ```
2. Paint column 2 with color 1. The table becomes:
   ```
   3 1 3
   0 1 0
   0 1 0
   ```
3. Paint row 2 with color 2. The table becomes:
   ```
   3 1 3
   2 2 2
   0 1 0
   ```

However, the program provided incorrectly paints the row and column without checking which operation was the most recent for each cell. The final output should be based on the last operation affecting each cell, which the program fails to implement correctly. 

Furthermore, rows and columns can be overwritten by subsequent operations, which must be taken into account to yield the correct results.

In conclusion, because the program does not maintain the correct order of operations for overlapping cells, it produces incorrect results, leading to the answer being **False**.
