To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the operations it performs and the logic implemented.

### Problem Analysis
1. The program must handle two types of operations:
   - **Type 1:** Paint all cells in a specified row with a specific color.
   - **Type 2:** Paint all cells in a specified column with a specific color.
2. If a cell has already been painted by a previous operation, it will change to the new specified color.

### Program Evaluation
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step.

```python
(n, m, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
l = [[0 for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
while k > 0:
    k -= 1
    (a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if a == 1:
        for i in range(m):
            l[b - 1][i] = c
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            l[i][b - 1] = c
print('\n'.join([''.join(['{:2}'.format(item) for item in row]) for row in l]))
```

1. **Initialization:** The program initializes a 2D list `l` of size `n x m` filled with zeros, which is correct.
2. **Processing Operations:**
   - For **row operations** (when `a == 1`), it correctly sets all elements of the specified row to the new color.
   - For **column operations** (when `a == 2`), it correctly sets all elements of the specified column to the new color.
   
### Potential Issues
However, there is a critical issue in the implementation:
- The program does not account for the priority of operations. If a cell is painted by a row operation and then by a column operation, the column operation should overwrite the row operation. The current implementation does not have this priority handling; it simply overwrites the whole row or column without checking previously painted cells.

### Example of Failure Case
Consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  3 3 2
  1 1 3  # Paint row 1 with color 3
  2 2 1  # Paint column 2 with color 1
  ```
  
- Expected output should be:
  ```
  3 1 3
  0 1 0
  0 1 0
  ```
  
- Actual output will be:
  ```
  3 1 3
  3 0 3
  3 0 3
  ```
  
This is because the row painting does not take into account that column painting should overwrite the previous row painting.

### Conclusion
Due to this failure to handle the priority of operations correctly, the program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
