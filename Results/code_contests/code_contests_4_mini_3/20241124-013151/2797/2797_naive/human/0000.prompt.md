You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kris works in a large company "Blake Technologies". As a best engineer of the company he was assigned a task to develop a printer that will be able to print horizontal and vertical strips. First prototype is already built and Kris wants to tests it. He wants you to implement the program that checks the result of the printing.

Printer works with a rectangular sheet of paper of size n × m. Consider the list as a table consisting of n rows and m columns. Rows are numbered from top to bottom with integers from 1 to n, while columns are numbered from left to right with integers from 1 to m. Initially, all cells are painted in color 0.

Your program has to support two operations: 

  1. Paint all cells in row ri in color ai; 
  2. Paint all cells in column ci in color ai. 



If during some operation i there is a cell that have already been painted, the color of this cell also changes to ai.

Your program has to print the resulting table after k operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n·m ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 000) — the dimensions of the sheet and the number of operations, respectively.

Each of the next k lines contains the description of exactly one query: 

  * 1 ri ai (1 ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), means that row ri is painted in color ai; 
  * 2 ci ai (1 ≤ ci ≤ m, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), means that column ci is painted in color ai. 

Output

Print n lines containing m integers each — the resulting table after all operations are applied.

Examples

Input

3 3 3
1 1 3
2 2 1
1 2 2


Output

3 1 3 
2 2 2 
0 1 0 


Input

5 3 5
1 1 1
1 3 1
1 5 1
2 1 1
2 3 1


Output

1 1 1 
1 0 1 
1 1 1 
1 0 1 
1 1 1 

Note

The figure below shows all three operations for the first sample step by step. The cells that were painted on the corresponding step are marked gray.

Program:
```
(n, m, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
l = [[0 for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
'for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            print l[i][j],\n        print'
while k > 0:
    k -= 1
    (a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if a == 1:
        for i in range(m):
            l[b - 1][i] = c
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            l[i][b - 1] = c
print('\n'.join([''.join(['{:2}'.format(item) for item in row]) for row in l]))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
