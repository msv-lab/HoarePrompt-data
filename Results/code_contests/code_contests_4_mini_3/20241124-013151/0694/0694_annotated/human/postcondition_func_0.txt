The function continuously accepts pairs of integers `h` and `w` until the pair (0, 0) is input, which terminates the process. For each valid pair where both `h` and `w` are greater than 0, the function prints a rectangle with `#` characters forming the border and `.` characters filling the interior. However, if both `h` and `w` are less than 3, the outer loop will not execute, and no output will be produced. Additionally, if either `h` or `w` is 0, no rectangle will be printed, and the function will simply await further input.
