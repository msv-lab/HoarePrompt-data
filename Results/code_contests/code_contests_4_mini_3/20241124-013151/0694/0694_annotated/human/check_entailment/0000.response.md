Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly print the frame as required. The key issues are:

1. The inner loop's print statements for the '#' and '.' characters are incorrect. The program currently prints '#' for every border character without considering the position in the grid properly. Specifically, it only prints a line of '#' characters instead of the required structure for the frame.

2. The logic for printing the frame does not correctly handle the printing of characters on the same line. After printing each character, it does not ensure that it remains on the same line until the entire row is printed. Instead, it seems to print each character on a new line.

3. The program does not handle the requirement to print a blank line after each dataset. The `print` statement at the end of the inner loop does not achieve the intended result of spacing between different frames.

As a result, the output from the program will not match the expected output described in the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
