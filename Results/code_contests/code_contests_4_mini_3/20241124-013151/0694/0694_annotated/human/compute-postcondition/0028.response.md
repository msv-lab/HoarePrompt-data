Postcondition: ***`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, the output is '.' indicating that `i` is within the valid range not touching the boundaries of the grid defined by `h` and `w`.***
