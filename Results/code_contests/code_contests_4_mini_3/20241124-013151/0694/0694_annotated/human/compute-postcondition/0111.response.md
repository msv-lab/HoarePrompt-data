According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `w` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be 2. Since `w` is greater than 1 (because `j` is currently 1), we don't need to change `w`, but we need to ensure that it remains greater than `j` to allow for further iterations.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `i`, and `j` is 2**
