The code prints the character `'#'`. The values of `h`, `w`, and `j` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of `h`, `w`, and `j`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than `w - 1`, `j` is adjusted to `w - 1, and the character '#' has been printed.**
