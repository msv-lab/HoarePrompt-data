To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the state of the variables at the end of the previous iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the relevant states are:
- `i` is 2
- `h` is greater than 1
- `w` is greater than 0
- `j` is 1

The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `0` to `w - 1`. Since `j` is currently `1`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to `2`. 

Next, we also need to ensure that the loop can still execute with the new value of `j`. We know that `w` is greater than `0`, which means `w` must be at least `2` for `j` to take on the new value of `2` without exceeding the limit of the range.

Given these conditions:
- `j` needs to be incremented to `2`.
- `w` must be adjusted to be at least `3` to allow `j` to be in the range for the next iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
