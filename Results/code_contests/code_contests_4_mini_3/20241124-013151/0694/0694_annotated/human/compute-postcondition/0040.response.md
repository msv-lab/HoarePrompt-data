According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `h` is greater than 0. Since `h` is also between 3 and 300, we can infer that `h` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2, and `i` must still be less than `h`.

Therefore, `h` remains between 3 and 300, and now `i` should be 2. 

State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is 0 or lower, `i` is 2, `j` is undefined, and no output is produced.**
