Output State: **If h is greater than 0 and w is greater than 0, the loop will execute h times, with i taking values from 0 to h-1, and for each value of i, the inner loop will execute w times, with j taking values from 0 to w-1. The output will print '#' for the borders (i = 0, j = 0, i = h - 1, j = w - 1) and '.' for the interior. If either h or w is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and the values of i and j remain undefined, with h and w unchanged.**
