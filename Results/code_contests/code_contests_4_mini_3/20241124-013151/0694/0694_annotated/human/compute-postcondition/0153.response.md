According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` equal to 1 and `w` is greater than 0, meaning `j` could still be less than `w`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to increment `j` by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2. Additionally, since `w` is greater than 0, it must also be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `j` should be changed to 2, and `w` must be greater than 2.

State: **`w` is greater than 2, `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `i` is 1**
