Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, then the output is '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`, the output is '.'.***
