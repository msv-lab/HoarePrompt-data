The code executes a print statement that outputs a period ('.'). The values of the variables `w`, `j`, `i`, and `h` do not change due to this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the fact that a period has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`, and a period ('.') has been printed.**
