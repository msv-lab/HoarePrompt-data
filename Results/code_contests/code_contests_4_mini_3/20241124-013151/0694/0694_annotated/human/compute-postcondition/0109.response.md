The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot (`.`) to the console. The values of the other variables (`h`, `i`, `w`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the indication that a dot was printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `i`, `j` is 1, and a dot was printed.**
