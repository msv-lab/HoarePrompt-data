The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `w`, and the output is `#`.

Output State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `w`, and the output is `#`**
