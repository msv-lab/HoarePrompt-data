Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, and `j` is an integer that is either 1 or incremented to the next integer where `j < w`. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program outputs '#'. In all other cases, the program outputs '.'***
