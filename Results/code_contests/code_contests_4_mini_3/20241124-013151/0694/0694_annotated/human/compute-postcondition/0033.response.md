According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. The condition states that `j` is between 0 and `w - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to be 2. 

Since `W` is between 3 and 300, it is guaranteed that `w` is at least 3, allowing for `j` to take on the value of 2. 

State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2.**
