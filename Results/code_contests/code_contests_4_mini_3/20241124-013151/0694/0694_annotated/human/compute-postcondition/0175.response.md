According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to `w`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions for `i`, `h`, and `w` do not affect the loop execution itself, but rather the output.

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `j` is 3**
