According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state indicates that `h` and `w` remain unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `w` must be greater than 0, `j` should start at 0, and `i` should be the value it was before the increment plus 1.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is the incremented value, `j` is 0**
