According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be greater than `i`, which is currently 1. Since `h` is greater than or equal to 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it must be adjusted to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. The value of `i` will also need to be updated to reflect the next iteration, which will be 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1**
