The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the character `#`. The values of the other variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the output is '#'**
