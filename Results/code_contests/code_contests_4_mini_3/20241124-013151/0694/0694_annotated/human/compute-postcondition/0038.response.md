Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times. For each iteration, `j` takes values from 0 to `w - 1`. When `j` is 0 or `j` is `w - 1`, the output is '#'. For other values of `j`, the output is '.'. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains 1, `j` is undefined, and no output is produced. In this case, `H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, and `w` is 0 or lower.**
