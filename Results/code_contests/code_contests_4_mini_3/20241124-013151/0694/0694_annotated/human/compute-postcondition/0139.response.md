According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either 1 or incremented to the next integer where `j < w`, which means `j` is not equal to `w - 1` and is less than `w`. 

To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, if `j` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, it will now be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

No further adjustments to the other states are necessary since `h` and `w` are already greater than 0, and we know `i` is a non-negative integer.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is incremented to 2**
