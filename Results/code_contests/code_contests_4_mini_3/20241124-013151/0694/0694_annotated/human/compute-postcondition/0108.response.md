The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The state of the variables `h`, `i`, `w`, and `j` remains unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `i`, `j` is 1**
