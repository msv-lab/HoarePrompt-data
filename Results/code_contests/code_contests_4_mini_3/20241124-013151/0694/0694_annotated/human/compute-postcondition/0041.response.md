According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 0 because the `range(0, w)` function generates a sequence starting from 0 up to (but not including) `w`. 

Given that `w` is currently 0 or lower, it needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `j` will start at 0 as it is the first value in the range.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `w` must be greater than 0, `j` is now 0 (the first value in the range).

State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
