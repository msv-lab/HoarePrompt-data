Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` and `j` are within valid bounds. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is between 1 and `h - 2`, and `j` is between 1 and `w - 2`, the output is '.'.***
