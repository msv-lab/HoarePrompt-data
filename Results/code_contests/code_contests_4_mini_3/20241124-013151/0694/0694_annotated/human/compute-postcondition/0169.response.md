The code executes a print statement that outputs a dot ('.'). The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the output is a dot.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the output is a dot.**
