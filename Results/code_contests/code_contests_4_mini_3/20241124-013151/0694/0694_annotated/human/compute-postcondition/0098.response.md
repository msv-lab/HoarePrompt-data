Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1 after the loop. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times printing either `#` or `.` based on the conditions. If `w` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `i` remains unchanged. The printed character will be `#` if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`; otherwise, `.` is printed for the remaining iterations.**
