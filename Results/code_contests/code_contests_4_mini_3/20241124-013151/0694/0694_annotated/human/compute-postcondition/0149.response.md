According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0, which means that the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1, while `w` remains greater than 0. The variables `i` and `h` do not need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, and `h` is greater than or equal to 1**
