Output State: **If `h` and `w` are both greater than or equal to 3, the loop will execute and print a rectangle of '#' for the borders and '.' for the interior. After the loop executes, `h` and `w` will retain their last input values. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the loop terminates immediately and no output occurs, leaving `h` and `w` as 0. If either `h` or `w` is less than 3, the outer loop will not execute, and `h` and `w` will remain unchanged. If `h` is greater than or equal to 3 and `w` is 0, the output will not occur, and `h` will remain unchanged while `w` will be 0. Similarly, if `h` is 0, the loop will not execute, leaving both `h` and `w` unchanged.**
