The code executes a print statement, which outputs a period ('.') to the console. The state of the other variables (`h`, `i`, `w`, `j`) is not altered by the print operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current values and conditions of those variables.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `i`, `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`, and a period ('.') is printed to the console.**
