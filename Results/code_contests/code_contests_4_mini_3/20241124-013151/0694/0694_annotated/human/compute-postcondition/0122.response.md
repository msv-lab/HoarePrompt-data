The values of the variables `h` and `w` do not change, and we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` and `w` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`h` and `w` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
