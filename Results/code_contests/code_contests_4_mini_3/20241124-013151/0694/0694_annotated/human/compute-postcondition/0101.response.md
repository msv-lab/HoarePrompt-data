According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0. The state indicates that `w` is greater than or equal to 0, but it doesn't guarantee that the loop will run unless `w` is strictly greater than 0. Additionally, the loop variable `j` will start at 0 for the first iteration. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `w` is greater than 0 and that `j` starts at 0.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `i`, `j` is 0**
