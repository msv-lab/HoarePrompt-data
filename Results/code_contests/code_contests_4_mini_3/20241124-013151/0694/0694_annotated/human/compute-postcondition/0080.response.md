Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, printing either '#' or '.' based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `h`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then '#' is printed; otherwise, '.' is printed. If `w` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and the values of `h`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
