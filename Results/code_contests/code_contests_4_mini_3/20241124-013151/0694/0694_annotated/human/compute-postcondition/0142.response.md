According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `h` and the range specified in the `for` loop. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, and the loop does not execute. 

Since the loop does not execute, `h` must be at least 1 for the loop to have the potential to execute. Additionally, `i` needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to be able to execute again.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `h` must be greater than or equal to 1,
- `i` must be adjusted to 1.

State: **`w` is 0, `j` remains undefined, `i` is 1, `h` is greater than or equal to 1**
