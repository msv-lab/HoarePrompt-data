According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `h`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` remains unchanged, the loop has executed with `i` being at its last value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`, and `h` should remain unchanged.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
