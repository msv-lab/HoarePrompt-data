According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 3, and `w` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`w` is greater than 3, `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, and `i` is 1**
