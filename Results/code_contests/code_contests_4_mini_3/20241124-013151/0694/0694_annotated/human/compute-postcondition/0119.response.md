Output State: **If both `h` and `w` are greater than 0, the loop will execute `h` times, and during each execution, `i` will take values from 0 to `h-1`. The printed output will consist of `#` for the first and last rows and the first and last columns, while the interior will be filled with `.`. If either `h` or `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables `h`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `h` is positive and `w` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `h` remains unchanged while `w` is 0. If `h` is 0, the loop won't execute, and both `h` and `w` remain unchanged.**
