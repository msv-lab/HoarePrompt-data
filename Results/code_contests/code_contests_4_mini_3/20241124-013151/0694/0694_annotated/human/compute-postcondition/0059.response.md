Output State: **If `h` and `w` are both greater than or equal to 3, the loop will execute `h` times. During the first iteration (`i` is 0), `j` will range from 0 to `w-1`, printing `#` for the boundary cases and `.` for the inner cells. If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is 0 or lower, the outer loop will still execute `h` times, but the inner loop will not execute, resulting in no output. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the program will break and no iterations will occur. After execution, `i` will be `h` and `j` will be undefined.**
