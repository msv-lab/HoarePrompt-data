According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. Specifically, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since `w` is greater than 0, it implies that the loop can execute again.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `w` does not need to change since it is already greater than 0, and the other variables (`h` and `i`) are not directly influenced by the loop.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` should be updated to 1.

The other states remain the same.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `i`, and `j` is 1**
