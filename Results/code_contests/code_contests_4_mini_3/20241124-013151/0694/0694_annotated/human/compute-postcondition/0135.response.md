According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the range from `0` to `w`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `w`, which allows the loop to execute again. 

Given that `j` is a non-negative integer and currently less than `w`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the value of `j` to the next integer, which would be `j + 1`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the states related to `h` and `w` remain unchanged, as they are still valid for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state would reflect that `j` is now equal to 1 (if it was 0) or incremented accordingly from its previous value, still ensuring that `j` is less than `w`.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1 (or incremented to the next integer where `j < w`)**
