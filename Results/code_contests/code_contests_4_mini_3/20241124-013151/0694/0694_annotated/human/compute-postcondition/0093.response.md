According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2, and it should still be less than `w`.

Since `w` is greater than 0, it could be either 1 or more. If `w` is 1, then `j` would be equal to `w` after the next increment (making `j` equal to 2), and the loop would not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 1.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 2**
