The code is a print statement that outputs the character `#`. It does not change the values of the existing variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state includes the original values of all those variables along with the action of printing.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the character '#' is printed.**
