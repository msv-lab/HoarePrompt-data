The input values for `h` and `w` will be taken from the user through `raw_input()`, and they will be converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The exact values of `h` and `w` are not provided, so we cannot specify them. Other variables (`i` and `j`) are not initialized in this snippet, and their states depend on the subsequent code execution which is not present here.

Thus, based on the provided information, the output state is that `h` and `w` will be defined as integers from user input, while `i` is undefined and will remain so until the loop is executed, which depends on the values of `h` and `w`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `i` is undefined, `j` is undefined**
