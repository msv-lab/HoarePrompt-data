According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute at least once, `w` must be greater than 0. The current state indicates that `h` is greater than 0, `w` is unchanged, and `i` is 0. However, there is no information provided about the value of `w`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `j` will start from 0. Since `i` is 0 and does not influence the loop execution, it remains unchanged.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
