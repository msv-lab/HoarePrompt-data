According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `w`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been adjusted to `w`, which means that `j` is now equal to `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w`, which means `j` needs to be adjusted to `w - 1` (the maximum valid index for `j` in the range). 

Since `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than `j`, we don't need to modify those states. The only state that requires adjustment is `j`.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than `w - 1`, `j` is adjusted to `w - 1`**
