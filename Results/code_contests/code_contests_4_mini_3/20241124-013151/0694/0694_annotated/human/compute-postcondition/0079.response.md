According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last value it took, which is `w - 1` (since the loop starts from `0` and goes up to `w - 1`). Given that `w` is greater than `w - 1`, the loop cannot execute one more time because `j` is now equal to `w - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `w` must be increased so that the new value of `w` is greater than `w - 1`, allowing `j` to take on the next value, which would be `w`. Thus, the adjustment needed is to make `w` greater than `w`.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than `w`, `j` is `w - 1`**
