According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `w`, which means the loop has completed its execution since the range for `j` is from 0 to `w - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 0 (the starting value of the range). Additionally, since `j` is going to be reset, we need to ensure that the conditions regarding `H`, `W`, `h`, and `w` remain valid. 

However, `H`, `W`, `h`, and `w` do not need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute again, as they are already within valid ranges. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be reset to 0.

State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0.**
