Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, and for each iteration `j`, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then `#` will be printed; otherwise, `.` will be printed. If `w` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and variables `h`, `i`, and `w` remain unchanged.**
