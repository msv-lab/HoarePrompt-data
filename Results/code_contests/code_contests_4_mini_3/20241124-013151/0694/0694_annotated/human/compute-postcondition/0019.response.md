According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` compared to `w`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1, which means it is now equal to its previous value plus 1.

Since `j` is incremented by 1, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect that it is now at `w` (which is out of the range for the for loop). Therefore, the loop will not execute again unless we adjust `w` to be greater than `j`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `j` to `w - 1` and `w` must be greater than `j`. This means `w` needs to be at least `j + 1`.

State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `w` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` and `j` are within valid bounds; `j` is equal to `w - 1`**
