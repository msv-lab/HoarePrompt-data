The code executes the `print('#')` statement, which outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output includes `#`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output includes `#`**
