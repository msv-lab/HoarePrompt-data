The code `print('.')` outputs a dot character to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` do not change as a result of this operation. Since `j` is mentioned as being incremented by 1, its state is affected, but the increment has already occurred before this line executes. Therefore, the output state captures the current state of the variables as well as the action taken.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `w` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` and `j` are within valid bounds; `j` is incremented by 1 and a dot is printed.**
