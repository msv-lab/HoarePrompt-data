The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or any conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is 0, `w` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
