Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, and `j` will take values from 0 to `w - 1`. The variable `i` remains 1, and `h` is greater than or equal to 1. Depending on the conditions, the program prints either '#' or '.' during each iteration. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined, while `i` is 1 and `h` is greater than or equal to 1.**
