The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. This action does not modify any of the variables `h`, `i`, `w`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables while indicating that a `#` has been printed. 

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `i`, `j` is equal to 0, and either `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and `#` has been printed.**
