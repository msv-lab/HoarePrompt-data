According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state is such that `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. This means that the loop has printed for `j = 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be incremented to 1.

Since `j` is currently 0, it is still within the valid range of the loop, and as `j` increases, it will eventually reach `w`. Therefore, the new state should reflect that `j` is now 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as `h` remains unchanged, and `w` is still greater than 0.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
