According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is at least 1 because `range(0, w)` generates an iterable that includes numbers from 0 to `w-1`. Since `h` being greater than 0 and `i` being 0 does not directly affect whether the loop will execute, the critical state that needs to be considered is `w`. For the loop to be executed, `w` must be greater than 0, and `j` should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
