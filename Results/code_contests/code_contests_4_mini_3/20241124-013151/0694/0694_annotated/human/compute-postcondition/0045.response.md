The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot (.), but it does not change any of the variables' values. Thus, the existing states of the variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and `i` is less than `h - 1`.

Output State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and `i` is less than `h - 1`**
