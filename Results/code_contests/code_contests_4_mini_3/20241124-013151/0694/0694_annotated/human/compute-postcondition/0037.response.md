According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `w` is between 3 and 300, it is guaranteed that the loop can execute one more time as long as `w` is greater than 2. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 3. The other states (`H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`) remain unchanged.

State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 3**
