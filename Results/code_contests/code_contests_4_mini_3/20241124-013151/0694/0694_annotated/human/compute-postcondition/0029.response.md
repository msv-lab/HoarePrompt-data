According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w`. The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, indicating that the loop has just started. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 1.

Since `W` is between 3 and 300, it ensures that there will be at least 3 iterations for `j` (0, 1, 2) if the loop has started. Therefore, the conditions for `W` must remain unchanged.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `H`, `h`, and `w` are not affected by the loop's execution at this point.

State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
