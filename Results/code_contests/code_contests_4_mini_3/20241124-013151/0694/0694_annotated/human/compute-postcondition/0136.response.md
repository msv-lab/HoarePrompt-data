The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not altered by this statement. Since there is no change to the state of the variables and the output only results in printing a character, we conclude that the output state remains focused on the existing values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1 (or incremented to the next integer where `j < w`), and the output is '#'**
