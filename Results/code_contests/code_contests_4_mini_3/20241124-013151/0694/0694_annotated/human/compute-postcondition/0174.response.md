Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output will be `#`. Otherwise, the output will be `.`. This includes cases where `i` is 2 and both `h` and `w` are more than their respective conditions, ensuring that all edge cases regarding the boundaries of `i` and `j` are covered.***
