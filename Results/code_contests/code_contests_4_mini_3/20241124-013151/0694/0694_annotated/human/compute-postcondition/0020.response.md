Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `w` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 0; `j` is within the range of 0 to `w - 1`. If `w` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes `w` times. In each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is between 1 and `h - 2`, and `j` is between 1 and `w - 2`, the output is '.'. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is produced.**
