Postcondition: ***`w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, and `h` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, the program prints `#`. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`, a period ('.') is printed.***
