The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `h`, `w`, or `j`. The previous states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the action of printing.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than `j`, `j` is adjusted to `w`, and `#` is printed**
