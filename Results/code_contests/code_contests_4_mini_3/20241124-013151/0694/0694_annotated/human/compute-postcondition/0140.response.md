Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, with `j` taking values from 0 to `w-1`. The output is '#' when `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. In all other cases, the output is '.'. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined, while `i` remains 0, `h` remains greater than 0, and `w` is 0.**
