Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are greater than 0, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1` and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, the character '.' is printed.***
