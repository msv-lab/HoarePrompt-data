According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `h` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `h` must be greater than 2 (so that `i` can take the value of 3). The state of `w` does not need to be adjusted since it is already greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute. The variable `j` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not defined in the loop's range.

State: **`w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `h` is greater than 2, `j` is some value from 0 to `w-1`**
