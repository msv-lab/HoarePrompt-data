According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop iterates `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `w` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from 2 to 3. Thus, we need to ensure that `j` is adjusted to 3, and we need to check if the condition for `w` allows `j` to be 3. Since `w` is greater than 1, it must also be at least 4 for the loop to continue. 

So, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `w` must be at least 4 and `j` should be 3.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 3, `i` is equal to `i`, and `j` is 3**
