Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `w` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` and `j` are within valid bounds. If either `i` or `j` is at the boundary (0 or `h - 1` for `i`, and 0 or `w - 1` for `j`), the function prints '#'; otherwise, it prints '.'.***
