According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `h` is greater than 0. Since `h` is between 3 and 300, it guarantees that `h` is at least 3, which means `i` is less than `h` (2 < 3). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value, which would be 3. Thus, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the next iteration. The value of `h` can remain as it is since it is already greater than `i`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `W`, `w`, and `j` do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is 0 or lower, `i` is 3, and `j` is undefined.**
