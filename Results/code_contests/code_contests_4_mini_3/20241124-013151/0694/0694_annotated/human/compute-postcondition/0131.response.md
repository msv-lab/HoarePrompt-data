According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a non-negative integer and we need to ensure that it is less than `w` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `j` is a non-negative integer, the only adjustment that needs to be made to allow the loop to run again is to increase the value of `j` by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to `j + 1`, and `j` must now be less than `w`.

State: **`h` and `w` are greater than 0, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers, `j` is less than `w`**
