The code prints the character `'#'`. Since the printing action does not affect the values of any of the variables, the output state remains unchanged. The current state of the variables is as follows: `H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and `j` is 0; and the output is '#'**
