The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console but does not modify any of the variable states. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `i`, and `j` is 2, and a dot is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `i`, `j` is 2, and a dot is printed.**
