According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. For the loop to execute, `h` must be greater than 0, as the range for `i` is from 0 to `h` (exclusive). If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the loop will not run. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `h` is greater than 0, and we can initialize `i` to 0 as the loop starts counting from there.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer, `i` is 0**
