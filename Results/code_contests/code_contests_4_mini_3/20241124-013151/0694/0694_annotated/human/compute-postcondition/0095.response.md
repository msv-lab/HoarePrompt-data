The `print('.')` statement outputs a period (dot) to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and a dot is printed to the console.**
