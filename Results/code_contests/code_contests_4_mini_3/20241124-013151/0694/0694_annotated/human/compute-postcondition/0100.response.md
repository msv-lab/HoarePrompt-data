According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, meaning it is now equal to its previous value plus 1. Since `w` is greater than or equal to 0, it does not affect the loop control. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `h` must be greater than the current value of `i`, which is `i - 1` before the increment. Therefore, `h` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `i` (which is now the incremented value). 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `h` must be greater than `i` after the increment, which means `h` must be at least `i + 1`.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i`, and `h` is greater than `i`**.
