According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `w` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `w`. Since `w` is greater than 1, `w` could be 2 or more; therefore, it must be adjusted to be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 3, `j` is 3**
