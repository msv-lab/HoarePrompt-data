The `print('.')` function outputs a dot ('.') to the console. The values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `h` and `w` are greater than 0, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers, `j` is less than `w`, and a dot is printed to the console.

Output State: **`h` and `w` are greater than 0, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers, `j` is less than `w`, and a dot is printed to the console.**
