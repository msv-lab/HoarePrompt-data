The print statement outputs a period ('.') to the console, but it does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than `w - 1`, `j` is adjusted to `w - 1`, and a period is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than `w - 1`, `j` is adjusted to `w - 1`, and a period is printed.**
