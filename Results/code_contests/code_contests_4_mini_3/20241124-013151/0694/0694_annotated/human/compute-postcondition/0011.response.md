According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` from 0 to `w-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within valid bounds, but we need to determine the value of `j` for the next iteration.

Since `j` is currently at its last value (which is `w - 1`), for the loop to execute one more time, `w` must be increased so that `j` can take on the value `w`. Therefore, the only adjustment that needs to be made is to ensure that `w` is at least 1 greater than its current value.

State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` and `j` are within valid bounds.**
