The code prints `#`, which does not affect the values of any variables, including `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j`. Since the print statement simply outputs a character and doesn't modify any variable state, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `w` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` and `j` are within valid bounds; `j` is incremented by 1, and the output is '#'**
