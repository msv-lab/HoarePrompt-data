According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within valid bounds, which means it must be less than `w`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. 

Since `j` can be incremented as long as it remains less than `w`, and since `j` is currently less than `w - 1`, we need to adjust `j` to `j + 1`. The value of `w` does not need to change since it will remain the same.

State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `w` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` and `j` are within valid bounds; `j` is incremented by 1**
