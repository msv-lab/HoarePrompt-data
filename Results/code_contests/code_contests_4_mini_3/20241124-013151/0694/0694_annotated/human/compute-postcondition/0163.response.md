The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output is the character `#`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
