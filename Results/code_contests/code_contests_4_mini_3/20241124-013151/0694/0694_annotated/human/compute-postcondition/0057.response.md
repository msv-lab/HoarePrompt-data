Given the initial state where `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined. The print statement does not specify any output, and the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, and `i` do not change.

Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes occurred due to the conditions set by `w`.

Output State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is 0 or lower, `i` is 2, and `j` is undefined.**
