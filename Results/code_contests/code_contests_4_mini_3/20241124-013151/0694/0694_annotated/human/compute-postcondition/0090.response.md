The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1 and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1 and the character `#` is printed.**
