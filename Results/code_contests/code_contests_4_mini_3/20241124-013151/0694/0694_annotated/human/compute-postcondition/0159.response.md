Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, and `j` will take values from 0 to `w - 1`, while `i` is 1 and `h` is greater than or equal to 1. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, `j` remains undefined, `i` is 1, and `h` is greater than or equal to 1. The program prints nothing since the `print` statement is incomplete.**
