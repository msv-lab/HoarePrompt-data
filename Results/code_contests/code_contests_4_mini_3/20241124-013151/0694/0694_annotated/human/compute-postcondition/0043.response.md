The code snippet `print('#')` outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not changed by this operation, and their previous states remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the program prints `#`.

Output State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the program prints `#`**
