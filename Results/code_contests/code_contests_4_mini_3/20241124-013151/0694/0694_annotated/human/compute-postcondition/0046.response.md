Postcondition: ***`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is either 0 or greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, if `j` is 0 or if `i` is equal to 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or if `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints `#`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and `i` is less than `h - 1`, the program prints `.`***
