According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program will not enter the loop and will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. So for the loop to be executed, `h` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. The values of `w` are irrelevant to the execution of this loop.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is unchanged, `i` is 0**
