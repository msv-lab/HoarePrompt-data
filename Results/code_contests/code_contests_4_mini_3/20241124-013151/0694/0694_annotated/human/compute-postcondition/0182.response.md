The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since it appears to read the input values for `H` and `W` within the function itself. However, the constraints indicate that `H` and `W` are integers, with both values ranging from 3 to 300. The function continues to process inputs until it encounters the pair of integers (0, 0), which indicates the end of input. Based on the output conditions and constraints provided, the functionality of the function is to handle pairs of integers `H` and `W`, ensuring they meet the specified bounds, and to terminate input processing when the pair (0, 0) is received.

Functionality: **The function accepts pairs of integers H and W within the range of 3 to 300, and it processes these pairs until it encounters the pair (0, 0), which signals the end of input.**
