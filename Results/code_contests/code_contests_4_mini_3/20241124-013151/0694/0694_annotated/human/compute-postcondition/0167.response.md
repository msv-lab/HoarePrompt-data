According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `w`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since `w` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `j` will increment by 1.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state of `j` to 1. The state of `i`, `h`, and `w` does not need to be modified for this next iteration since they are not directly influencing the loop execution at this moment.

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
