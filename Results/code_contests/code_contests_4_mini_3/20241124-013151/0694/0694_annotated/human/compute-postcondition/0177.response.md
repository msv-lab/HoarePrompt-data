Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, and `j` will take on values from 0 to `w-1`, the output will be '#' if `i` equals 0, or `j` equals 0, or `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`. Otherwise, the output will be '.'. If `w` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and the values of `i`, `h`, and `j` remain unchanged, with `j` not being defined.**
