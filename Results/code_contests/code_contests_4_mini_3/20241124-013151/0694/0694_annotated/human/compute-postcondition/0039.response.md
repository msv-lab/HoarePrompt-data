The loop does not execute because `w` is 0 or lower. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 1, `j` is undefined, and no output is produced. The other variables `H` and `W` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is 0 or lower, `i` is 1, `j` is undefined, and no output is produced.**
