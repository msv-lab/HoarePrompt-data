The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `w`, `j`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `h` is greater than or equal to 1, and the program prints `#`.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `h` is greater than or equal to 1, and the program prints `#`**
