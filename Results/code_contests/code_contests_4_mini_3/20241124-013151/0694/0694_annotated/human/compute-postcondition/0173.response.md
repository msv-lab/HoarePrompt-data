The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The values of `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after the execution. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the dot is printed.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the dot is printed.**
