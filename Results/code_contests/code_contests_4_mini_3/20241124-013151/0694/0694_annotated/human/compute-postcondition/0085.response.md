The code executes a print statement which outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that the character has been printed, while the previous values of the variables are maintained. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is the incremented value, `j` is 0, and the character `#` has been printed.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is the incremented value, `j` is 0, and the character `#` has been printed.**
