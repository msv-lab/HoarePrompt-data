Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, iterating `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. During each iteration, if `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, the output is '.'. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined. In this case, `H` is between 3 and 300, `W` is between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is 0 or lower, and `i` is 2.**
