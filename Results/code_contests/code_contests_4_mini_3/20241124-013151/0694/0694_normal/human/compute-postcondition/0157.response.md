According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 1. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3, and it must still be true that `w` is greater than 3 to allow `j` to be less than `w`.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
