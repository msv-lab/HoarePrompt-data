According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is at least 1, as it specifies the range for the variable `j`. The current state indicates that `h` is greater than 0, which is not relevant for the execution of this loop, and `i` is 0, which is also not used in this loop.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `w` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0, since the range is from 0 to `w`.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
