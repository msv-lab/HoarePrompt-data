Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is equal to `w`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, the output is a dot ('.').***
