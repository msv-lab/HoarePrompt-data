The code prints a period (`.`), which does not affect the values of any variables. The states of `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 2**
