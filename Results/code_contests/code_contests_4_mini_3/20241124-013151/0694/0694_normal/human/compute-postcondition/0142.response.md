According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `h` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1, and we need to ensure that `h` remains greater than `i` (which will be 1). Thus, `h` needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is at least 0, `i` is 1**
