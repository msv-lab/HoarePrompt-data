Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, iterating over values of `j` from 0 to `w-1`. In each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, it outputs `'#'`. Otherwise, it outputs `'.'`. If `w` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and no output occurs. In this case, `j` is not defined, and `w` remains 0, while `h` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2.**
