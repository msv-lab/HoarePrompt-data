According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `w` is greater than 2. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3, and it must be ensured that `w` is still greater than 3.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted such that `j` is 3 and `w` is greater than 3.

State: **`i` is `h - 1`, `h` is greater than `h - 1`, `w` is greater than 3, and `j` is 3**
