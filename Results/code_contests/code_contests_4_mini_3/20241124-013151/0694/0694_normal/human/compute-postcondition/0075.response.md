According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the dimension `w`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `w` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
