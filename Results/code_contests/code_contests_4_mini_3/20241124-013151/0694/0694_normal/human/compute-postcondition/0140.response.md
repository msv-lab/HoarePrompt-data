Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 0, and `i` is 0. The loop will execute `w` times if `w` is greater than 0. For each iteration `j`, if `j` is 0 or equal to `w - 1`, or `i` is 0 or equal to `h - 1`, the program prints '#'. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no character is printed. Therefore, if `w` is 0, the output is empty, while if `w` is greater than 0, the output will contain a series of '#' and possibly '.' characters based on the conditions.**
