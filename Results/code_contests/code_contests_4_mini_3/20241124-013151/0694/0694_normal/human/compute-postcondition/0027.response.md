The code executes a print statement that outputs a dot (`.`). The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the dot was printed while all other variables retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h` and is not equal to 0, `j` is 0 and is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1` and a dot (.) was printed.**
