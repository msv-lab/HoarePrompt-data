According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `h`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `h` is greater than 2, which means `h` could be 3 or more. To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `h` must remain greater than 3.

State: **`w` is 0, `h` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
