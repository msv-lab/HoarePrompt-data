Output State: **If h is greater than 0 and w is greater than 0, the loop will execute h times, printing '#' for the first and last rows and first and last columns, and '.' for the inner parts of the grid. If either h or w is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated. In cases where both h and w are 0, the program breaks out without any execution, and no output occurs. Therefore, h remains unchanged, and w remains unchanged.**
