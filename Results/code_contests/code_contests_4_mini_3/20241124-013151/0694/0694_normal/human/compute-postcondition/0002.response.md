The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is equal to 0, and `w` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
