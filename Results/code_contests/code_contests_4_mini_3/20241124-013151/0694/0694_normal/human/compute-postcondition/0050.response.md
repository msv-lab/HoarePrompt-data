Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 1. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.' This encompasses all edge cases, considering the boundaries where `i` and `j` can reach their minimum or maximum values.***
