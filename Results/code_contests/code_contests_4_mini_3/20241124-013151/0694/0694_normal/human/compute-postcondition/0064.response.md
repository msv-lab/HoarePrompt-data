According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `h`. The loop will only execute if `h` is greater than 0. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, meaning the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `h` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is any value (can be 0 or non-zero), `i` is 0**
