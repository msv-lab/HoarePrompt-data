According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 0. The current state indicates that `w` is at least 0, but to ensure the loop executes, `w` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `w` is greater than 0.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
