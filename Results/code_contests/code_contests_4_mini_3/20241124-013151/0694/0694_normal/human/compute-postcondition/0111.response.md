According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `w` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `w` for the loop to execute again.

To adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop:
- The current value of `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
- The condition `j < w` must still hold true. Since `w` is greater than 0, we will assume that it is at least 2 to allow `j` to be incremented to 2.

So we need to ensure that:
- `j` is now 2.
- `w` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

No other states need to be adjusted since `i`, `h`, and `w` do not need changes based on the loop's requirements.

State: **`i` is `h - 1`, `h` is greater than `h - 1`, `w` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
