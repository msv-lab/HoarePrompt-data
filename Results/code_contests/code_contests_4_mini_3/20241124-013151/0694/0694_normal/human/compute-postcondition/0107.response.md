According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to run one more time, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect the next iteration. The next value of `j` will be 1. Since the condition regarding `j` being less than `w` must hold true, we do not need to change `w`, but we do need to ensure that `j` is now set to 1.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` has incremented to 1 while `h` and `w` remain as they are.

State: **`i` is `h - 1`, `h` is greater than `h - 1`, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1**
