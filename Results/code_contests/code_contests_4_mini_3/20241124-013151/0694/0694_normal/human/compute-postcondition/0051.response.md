According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is 1. Since `w` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, and `i` are not directly affecting the loop's execution in this case. 

State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 2.**
