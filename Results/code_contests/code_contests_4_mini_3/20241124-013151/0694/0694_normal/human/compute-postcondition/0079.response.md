According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which means `j` will become 3 in the next iteration. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3, and the condition for the loop to execute again requires that `w` must be greater than 3.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
