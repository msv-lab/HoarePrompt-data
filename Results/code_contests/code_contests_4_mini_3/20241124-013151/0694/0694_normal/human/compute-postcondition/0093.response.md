According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j`, which is used as the loop index. The loop is set to execute for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `w` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value, which would be 2. In addition, we need to ensure that `j` is still within the range defined by `w`. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `w` must be at least 3 (to accommodate `j` values of 0, 1, and 2).

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 2**
