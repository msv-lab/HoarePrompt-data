According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `w - 1`, so for it to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3, and `w` must be at least 4 to allow for the loop to iterate on this new value of `j`.

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer greater than 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 3**
