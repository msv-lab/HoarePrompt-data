Output State: **If `h` and `w` are both greater than or equal to 3, the loop will execute, printing a grid with `#` for the perimeter and `.` for the inner cells, producing `h` lines of output with `w` characters each. If either `h` or `w` is less than 3, the loop will not execute, and no output will be generated, with `h` and `w` remaining unchanged. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the program will terminate without executing the loop, and no output will occur. The loop control variables `i` and `j` will be reset for each grid generated, ranging from 0 to `h - 1` and 0 to `w - 1`, respectively.**
