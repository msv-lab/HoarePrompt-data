Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer greater than 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints `'#'`. Otherwise, the program prints `'.'`. This accounts for the boundaries of the grid or area defined by `h` and `w`, ensuring proper handling of edge cases where `i` or `j` may be at the limits of their respective ranges.***
