Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 0. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, when `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, and `j` is less than `w - 1`, the program prints '.'***
