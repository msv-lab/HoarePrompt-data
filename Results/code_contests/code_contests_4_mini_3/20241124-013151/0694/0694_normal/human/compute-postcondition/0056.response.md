Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to `h`. The loop executes `w` times with `j` ranging from 0 to `w - 1`. For each value of `j`, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated. In this case, `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `w` maintain their initial values, while `j` does not get assigned any value.**
