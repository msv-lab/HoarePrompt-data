Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, then the program prints `#`. Otherwise, it prints `.`. This covers the cases where `i` or `j` are on the borders of the defined grid (top, bottom, left, or right), as well as the case where they are not, resulting in the corresponding output.***
