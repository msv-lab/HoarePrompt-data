According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to 2, and for the loop to iterate again, `w` must be greater than 2.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` is now 2.
- `w` must be greater than 2.

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer greater than 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 2.**
