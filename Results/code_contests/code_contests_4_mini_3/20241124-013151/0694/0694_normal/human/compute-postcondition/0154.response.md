The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#`, but it does not alter the values of any variables. The values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the character `#` is printed**.
