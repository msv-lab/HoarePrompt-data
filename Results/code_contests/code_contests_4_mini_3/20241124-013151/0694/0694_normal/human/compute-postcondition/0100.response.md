According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value for the previous iteration. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `h - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and we need to ensure `h` is greater than the current value of `i`.

Assuming `i` was at its maximum before the last iteration, we need to set `i` to `h - 1` at the end of the last iteration. Thus, `h` must be at least 1 greater than the last value of `i`.

State: **`i` is h - 1, h is greater than h - 1**
