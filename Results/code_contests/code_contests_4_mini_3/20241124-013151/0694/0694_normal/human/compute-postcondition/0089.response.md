According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make it 1. Additionally, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must still be less than `w`. Since `w` is greater than 0, it can remain greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` should be incremented to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as `i` and `h` are not relevant to the continuation of the `for` loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
