The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs a dot ('.'). This does not affect any of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the action of printing a dot.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a dot ('.') is printed.**
