The statement `print('.')` outputs a dot to the console. The variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged apart from the printed output.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 2; a dot (.) is printed.**
