To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0.

2. **Loop Structure**: The loop is defined as:
   ```
   for j in range(0, w):
   ```
   This means the loop will iterate over `j` from 0 up to (but not including) `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`.

3. **Current value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to increment to the next value, which will be 1 in the next iteration.

4. **Condition for loop continuation**: Since `j` is currently 0 and the maximum value of `j` can go up to `w - 1`, `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing after this point. 

5. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure the loop can execute again:
   - The state of `j` should be adjusted to reflect its increment to 1.
   - The condition for `w` should ensure it is still greater than 1 (as `w` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed at all).

Based on these points, the required adjustments can be made to the state.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
