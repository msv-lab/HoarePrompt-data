The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot character to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged by this statement, as it only affects the output to the terminal. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and the output is a dot.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and the output is a dot.**
