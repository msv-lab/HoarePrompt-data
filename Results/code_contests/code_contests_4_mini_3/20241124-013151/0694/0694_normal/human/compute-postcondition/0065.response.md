According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0. Since `h` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0, the variable `j` will start at 0 during the first iteration. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to assert that `w` is greater than 0.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
