The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed character.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 2, and `#` is printed.**
