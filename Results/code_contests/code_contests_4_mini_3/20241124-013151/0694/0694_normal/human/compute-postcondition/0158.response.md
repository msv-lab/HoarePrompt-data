Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, printing `#` for `j = 0` and `j = w - 1`, and printing `.` for values of `j` between 1 and `w - 2` if `h` is greater than 2. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `h` remains greater than 1, `w` is 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is not defined.**
