The code prints the character `#`. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and notes the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 1, and the output is `#`.**
