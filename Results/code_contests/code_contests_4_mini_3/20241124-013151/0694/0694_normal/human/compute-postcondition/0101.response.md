According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is at least 1. The existing state indicates that `i` is `h - 1`, and `h` is greater than `h - 1`, which does not influence the execution of the loop directly.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `w` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `w` must be greater than 0 and `j` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`i` is h - 1, `h` is greater than h - 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
