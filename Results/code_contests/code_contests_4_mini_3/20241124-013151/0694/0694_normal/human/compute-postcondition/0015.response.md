According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer between 1 and `w - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increase to the next integer, which would be `j + 1`. Consequently, `j` must be set to the next value, which would be equal to `w`. 

Since `j` is currently between 1 and `w - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `w` must be greater than `j`. Thus, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now equal to the current maximum value, which is `w`, and it must be confirmed that `w` remains within the bounds of 3 to 300.

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is equal to `w`**
