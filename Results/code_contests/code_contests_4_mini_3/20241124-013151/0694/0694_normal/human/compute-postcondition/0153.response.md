According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. The loop is set to iterate over `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value, which would be 2. 

Since `w` is greater than 1, `j` can be incremented without exceeding the range defined by `w`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 2.

The values of `h`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop's ability to continue iterating at this moment.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
