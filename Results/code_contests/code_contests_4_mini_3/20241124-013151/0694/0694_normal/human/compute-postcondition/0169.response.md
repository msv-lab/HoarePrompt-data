The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The values of the variables `w`, `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and a dot is printed.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and a dot is printed**.
