The `print('#')` statement outputs a string containing the character `#`. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the addition of the printed character.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 0. `i` is either 0, equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to 0, or `j` is equal to `w - 1; '#' is printed.**
