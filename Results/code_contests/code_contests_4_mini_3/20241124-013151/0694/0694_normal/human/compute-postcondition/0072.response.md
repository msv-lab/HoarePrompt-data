The `print('#')` statement outputs a string `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
