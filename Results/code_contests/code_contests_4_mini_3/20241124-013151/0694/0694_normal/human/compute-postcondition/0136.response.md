The code executes a print statement which outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged since the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the program prints `#`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the program prints `#`**
