Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 0. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 0, and neither `i` nor `j` are on the border of the given dimensions, then a dot (.) is printed. This ensures that all edge cases regarding the boundaries of the grid are properly handled.***
