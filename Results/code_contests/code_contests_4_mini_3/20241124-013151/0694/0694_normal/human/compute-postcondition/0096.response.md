Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is `'#'`; otherwise, the output is `'.'`. This covers the cases where `i` is at the top or bottom boundary, `j` is at the left boundary, or `j` is at the right boundary of the grid defined by `h` and `w`.
