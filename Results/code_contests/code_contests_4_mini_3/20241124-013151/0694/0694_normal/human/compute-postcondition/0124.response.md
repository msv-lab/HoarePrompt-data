According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `w`. For the loop to execute, `h` must be greater than 0, since the range for `i` is from 0 to `h`. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, preventing the loop from executing. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `h` is greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0. 

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is any value, `i` is 0**
