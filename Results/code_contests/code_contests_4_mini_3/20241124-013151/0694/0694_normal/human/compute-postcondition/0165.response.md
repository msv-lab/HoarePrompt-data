The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. It does not modify the values of any variables or their states. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is defined and not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to h - 1, and `j` is not equal to w - 1.**
