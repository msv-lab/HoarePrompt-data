Output State: **If w is greater than 0, the loop executes w times, printing '#' for the first and last columns (j = 0 and j = w - 1) and '#' for the last row (i = h - 1), while printing '.' for the other positions. If w is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and the values remain `i` is `h - 1`, `h` is greater than `h - 1`, and no output is generated.**
