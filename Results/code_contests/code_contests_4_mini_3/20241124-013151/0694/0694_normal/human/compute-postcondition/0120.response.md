According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement inside the loop. Therefore, there are no specific states that need to be adjusted for it to execute one more time.

State: **If `h` and `w` are both greater than 0, the loop will execute `h` times, and for each iteration, it will produce output corresponding to `w` columns. The output will consist of `#` for the boundary cells (when `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`) and `.` for the inner cells. If `h` is 0 or `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated, with `h` and `w` remaining unchanged.**
