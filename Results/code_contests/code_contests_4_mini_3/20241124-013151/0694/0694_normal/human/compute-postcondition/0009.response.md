The code executes a print statement, which outputs a dot ('.'). The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and the output is a dot ('.').

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and the output is '.'**
