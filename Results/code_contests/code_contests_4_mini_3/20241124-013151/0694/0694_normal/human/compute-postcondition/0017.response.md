The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state with the additional information that a dot has been printed.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, `j` is equal to `w`, and a dot has been printed.**
