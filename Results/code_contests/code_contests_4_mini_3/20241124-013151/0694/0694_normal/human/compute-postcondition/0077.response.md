The statement `print('.')` executes and outputs a dot `.` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state is `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
