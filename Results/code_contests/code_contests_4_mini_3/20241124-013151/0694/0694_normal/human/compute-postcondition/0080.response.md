Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, printing `#` for `j` equal to 0 and `w - 1`, and for any `j` where `i` is 0. If `h` is greater than 0, `w` can be 0 or greater, but if `w` is 0, the loop does not execute and `i` remains 0. Therefore, if `w` is at least 1, `j` will range from 0 to `w - 1`, and the output will print `#` for the first and last positions, and `#` for all positions when `i` is 0. If `h` is at least 1 and `w` is at least 1, the output will produce a border of `#`s along the top and bottom (if `i` is equal to `h - 1`), and left and right edges (if `j` is equal to `0` or `w-1`), with dots in all inner positions. If `w` is 0, `i` is 0, and the loop does not execute, no output is produced.**
