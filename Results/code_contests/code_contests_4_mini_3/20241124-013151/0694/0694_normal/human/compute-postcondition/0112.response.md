The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, as this print statement does not alter any variable values. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that the character `#` was printed.

Output State: **`i` is `h - 1`, `h` is greater than `h - 1`, `w` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the character '#' was printed.**
