According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be at least 1. Given that `j` will have values from 0 to `w - 1`, if `w` is 1 or greater, the loop will run at least once. 

Since `H` and `W` are both integers between 3 and 300, they do not affect the loop execution directly, but `h` must be greater than `i`, and `i` is set equal to `h`. There are no other restrictions that would prevent the loop from executing based on the current state of `i`, `h`, and `j`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `w` is at least 1, and at the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to 0.

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 0**
