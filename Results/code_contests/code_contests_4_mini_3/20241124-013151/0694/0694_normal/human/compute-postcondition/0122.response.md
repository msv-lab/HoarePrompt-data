The values of the variables `h` and `w` do not change, and the `break` statement exits the most internal loop or conditional structure we were in. Since the loop executes only if both `h` and `w` are greater than 0, we assume that the loop was active. Therefore, the output state is: `h` and `w` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`h` and `w` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
