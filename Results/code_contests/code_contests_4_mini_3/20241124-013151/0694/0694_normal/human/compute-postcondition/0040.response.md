According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit defined by `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `h`, meaning the loop cannot execute again since the condition `i < h` is false. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be increased so that `i` can be less than `h` in the next iteration. Since `i` is currently equal to `h`, we can adjust `h` to be greater than `i`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `h` must now be greater than `i` (which is equal to `h`). 

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` will have values from 0 to `w - 1`.**
