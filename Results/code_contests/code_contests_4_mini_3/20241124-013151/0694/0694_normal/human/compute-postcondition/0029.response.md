According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and the variable `w` is between 3 and 300, which means `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1.

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 1.**
