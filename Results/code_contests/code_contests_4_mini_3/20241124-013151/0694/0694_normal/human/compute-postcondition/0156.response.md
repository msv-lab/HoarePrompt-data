Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character `#` is printed. Otherwise, the character `.` is printed. In this scenario, since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the character `#` will not be printed if `h` is greater than 2 and `w` is greater than 3, resulting in the character `.` being printed.***
