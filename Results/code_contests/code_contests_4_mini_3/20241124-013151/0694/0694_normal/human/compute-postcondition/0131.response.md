According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to 1. The state of `h` and `w` does not need to change since `h` is still greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0, which allows the loop to continue executing.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
