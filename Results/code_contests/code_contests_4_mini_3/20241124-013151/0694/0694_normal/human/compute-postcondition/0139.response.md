According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `w` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 3. Additionally, the condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `w`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the condition to `w` being greater than 3.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
