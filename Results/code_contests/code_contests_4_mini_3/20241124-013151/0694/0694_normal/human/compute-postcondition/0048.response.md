The code executes a print statement, which outputs `#` to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 1**
