According to the code, the `while True` loop can execute indefinitely, meaning it will continue to run without any condition to break out of it. Since the loop will execute one more time regardless of the values of `h` and `w`, there is no need to adjust any states.

State: **If h is greater than 0 and w is greater than 0, the loop will continue to execute.**
