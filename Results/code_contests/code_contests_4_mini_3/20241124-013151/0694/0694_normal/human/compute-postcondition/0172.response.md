The code prints `'#'`, which does not affect the state of the variables `w`, `h`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is greater than 3, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and the output includes the printed character '#'.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 3, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and the output includes the printed character '#'**
