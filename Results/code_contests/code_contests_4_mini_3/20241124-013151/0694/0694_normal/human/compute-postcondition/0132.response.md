The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not change the values of any of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables alongside the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the character '#' is printed.**
