Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1`. If `w` is 0, no output is produced. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, producing output based on the specified conditions.**
