According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `w` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w`. Since `j` is currently 4, this means that `w` must be greater than 4.

No other states need to be adjusted since `i` and `h` do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

State: **`w` is greater than 4, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is 4**
