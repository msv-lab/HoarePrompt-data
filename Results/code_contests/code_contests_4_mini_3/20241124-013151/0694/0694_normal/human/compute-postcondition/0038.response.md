Output State: **If `w` is at least 1, the loop will execute `w` times, printing '#' for `j` equal to 0 or `w - 1`, or when `i` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1`. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. After execution, `H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` will have values from 0 to `w - 1`.**
