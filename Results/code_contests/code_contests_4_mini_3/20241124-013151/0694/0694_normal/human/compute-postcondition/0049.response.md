The `print('.')` statement outputs a period (.) to the console. The variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding these variables.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 1, and a period (.) is printed to the console.**
