According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will iterate as long as `w` is greater than 0. Given that `H`, `W`, and `h` do not directly affect the loop execution, the key variable is `w`. 

Since `w` can be any integer, it could potentially be 0, in which case the loop would not execute. To ensure that the loop executes, `w` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0, which is the beginning of the range defined by `w`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `w` is greater than 0, while `i` remains at 0.

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
