According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. The condition for `j` to be less than `w` must still hold, so `w` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `j` should be 1, and `w` should be greater than 1.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
