According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `h`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `h` is greater than 1, which means `i` can be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `h` must remain greater than `i` after the last iteration. Since `i` will be 2 in the next iteration, `h` must be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `w` and `j` do not influence the execution of the loop.

State: **`w` is 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is not defined**
