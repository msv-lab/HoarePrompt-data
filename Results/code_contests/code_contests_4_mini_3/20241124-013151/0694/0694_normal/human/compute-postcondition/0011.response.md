According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `w`. Since the state indicates that `j` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1`, it is possible that the loop can execute again if `j` is currently less than `w - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within the range of 0 to `w - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` should be adjusted to `j + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted since `H`, `W`, `h`, and `w` remain unchanged.

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is an integer between 1 and `w - 1`**
