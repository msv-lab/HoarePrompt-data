Output State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` ranges from 0 to `w - 1`. For each value of `j`, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, then the output is '#'. Otherwise, the output is '.'. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is produced. If `h` is 0 or negative, it contradicts the initial state but would imply that `i` cannot reach `h - 1`.**
