The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it operates based on the constraints that H and W are integers that must be provided, where both H and W are greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 300. The input for the function continues until the pair (0, 0) is received, which signifies the end of input. After processing the inputs, the function returns results based on the values of H and W according to the defined logic of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to handle pairs of integers H and W, ensuring they meet the specified constraints, and to process these inputs until the termination signal (0, 0) is encountered.

Functionality: **The function accepts pairs of integers H and W, where H and W are between 3 and 300, and processes them until the input (0, 0) is received.**
