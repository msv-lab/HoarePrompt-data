The code prints a dot ('.'), which does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is an integer between 1 and `w - 1`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is an integer between 1 and `w - 1`**
