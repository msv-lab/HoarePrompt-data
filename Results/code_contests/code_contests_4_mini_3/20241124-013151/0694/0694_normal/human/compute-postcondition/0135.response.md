According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `w` is greater than 0. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. For the loop to execute again, `w` must be greater than 2.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
