Postcondition: ***`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is `#`. Otherwise, if `j` is defined and not equal to 0, and `i` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`, the output is `.`.***
