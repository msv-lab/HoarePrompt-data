The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is assigned a value based on input, `w` is assigned a value based on input, `H` remains unchanged, `W` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
