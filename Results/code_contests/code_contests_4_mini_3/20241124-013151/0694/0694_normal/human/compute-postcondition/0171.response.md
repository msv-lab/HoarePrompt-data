According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 4.

Since `j` is currently 3 and we know that `w` is greater than 3 (to allow for at least one more iteration), we can adjust the state to reflect that `j` has been incremented. 

State: **`w` is greater than 3, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
