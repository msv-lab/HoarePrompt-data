Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1`. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the function prints '#'. Otherwise, when `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, the function prints '.'***
