The `print` function outputs the string `'#'` to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and the output is `'#'`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and the output is `'#'`**
