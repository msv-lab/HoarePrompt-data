Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1`. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is produced. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, printing '#' for `j` equal to 0 or `w - 1`, and for all `j` when `i` is 0 or `i` is `h - 1`. For all other cases where `i` is between 1 and `h - 2` and `j` is between 1 and `w - 2`, the output is '.'.**
