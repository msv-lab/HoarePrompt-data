According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `h`, which means the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be increased to be greater than `i`. Since `i` is currently equal to `h`, we can adjust the state to reflect that `h` is now greater than `i`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `H`, `W`, `w`, and `h` can remain unchanged for this requirement.

State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to `h`**
