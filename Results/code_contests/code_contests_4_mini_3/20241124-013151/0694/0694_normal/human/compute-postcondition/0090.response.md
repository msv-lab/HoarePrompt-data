The `print('#')` command outputs a string `'#'` to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the output `'#'` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the output '#' is printed**
