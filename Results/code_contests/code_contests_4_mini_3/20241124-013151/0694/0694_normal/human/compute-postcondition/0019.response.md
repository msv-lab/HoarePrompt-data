According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `w`. The loop is structured to iterate through the range from 0 to `w`, meaning it will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `j` is equal to `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `w - 1`. 

Since `j` is at its maximum value of `w`, the state must also reflect that `j` is now `w - 1` to allow for the loop to execute again.

State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is `w - 1`.**
