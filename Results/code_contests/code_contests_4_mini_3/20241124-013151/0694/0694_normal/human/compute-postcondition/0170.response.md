Postcondition: ***`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is 3. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, the output is '.'. This includes cases where either `i` or `j` is on the boundary defined by the dimensions `h` and `w`, as well as the situation where both are inside the boundaries.***
