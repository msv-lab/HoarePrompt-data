The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects that `#` has been printed, and the values of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer greater than 2, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 2, and `#` has been printed.**
