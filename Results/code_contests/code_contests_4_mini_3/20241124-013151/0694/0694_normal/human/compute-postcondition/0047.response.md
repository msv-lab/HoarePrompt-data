According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `w` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to the next value, which will be 1. The variable `w` does not need to be adjusted as it is already established that it is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 1**
