Functionality: ** The function reads pairs of integers `h` and `w` from input until the pair (0, 0) is encountered. For each valid pair (where both `h` and `w` are greater than 0), it prints a grid of characters of height `h` and width `w`, with `#` representing the perimeter and `.` representing the inner cells. If either `h` or `w` is less than 3, no grid is printed. The function does not validate the input values to ensure they are within the range of 3 to 300, and it does not handle any errors that might arise from invalid input types.**
