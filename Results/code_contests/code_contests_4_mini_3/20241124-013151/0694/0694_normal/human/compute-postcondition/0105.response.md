The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot ('.') to the console. It does not affect any variables or their values. The initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is h - 1, `h` is greater than h - 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to h - 1, and `j` is not equal to w - 1. 

Output State: **`i` is h - 1, `h` is greater than h - 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to h - 1, and `j` is not equal to w - 1.**
