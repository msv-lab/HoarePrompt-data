Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, then a '#' is printed. Otherwise, a '.' is printed. This accounts for the boundary cases where `i` or `j` are at the edges of a grid defined by dimensions `h` and `w`.***
