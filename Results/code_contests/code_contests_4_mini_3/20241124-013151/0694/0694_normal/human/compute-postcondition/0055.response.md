According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `w` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to the next value, which is 3. We also need to ensure that `w` is greater than 3 to allow for this next iteration. The conditions on `H`, `W`, `h`, and `i` do not need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop's ability to continue running.

Thus, the adjusted state will be:
State: **`H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 3**
