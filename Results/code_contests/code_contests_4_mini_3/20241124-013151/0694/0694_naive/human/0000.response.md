Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly draw the frame as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to print the frame is flawed. 

1. The conditions for printing `#` and `.` are incorrect. The program currently prints `#` for any position on the first row, the first column, and the last column, but it fails to account for the last row correctly. The condition `(j == w - 1)` is redundant and should be combined with the condition for the last row.

2. The outer loop iterates through the height `h`, and the inner loop iterates through the width `w`, but it does not print the correct symbols for all positions. For example, in the case of an input like `3 4`, the output should be:
   ```
   ####
   #..#
   ####
   ```
   But the program would incorrectly print:
   ```
   ####
   #
   ####
   ```
   This shows that the program is not producing the expected frame structure.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
