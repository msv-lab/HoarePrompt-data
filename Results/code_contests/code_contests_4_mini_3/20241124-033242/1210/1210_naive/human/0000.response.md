To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the code:

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The input can either specify a day of the week ("x of week") or a day of the month ("x of month").
2. For "x of week", the output should be the number of that specific day in the year 2016.
   - Each day of the week occurs 52 times in a non-leap year, and since 2016 is a leap year, it will have an extra occurrence of some days. In 2016, the first day (January 1) is a Friday, meaning that:
     - Monday (1) occurs 52 times + 1 extra (for the week starting on January 4).
     - Tuesday (2) occurs 52 times + 1 extra (for the week starting on January 5).
     - Wednesday (3) occurs 52 times + 1 extra (for the week starting on January 6).
     - Thursday (4) occurs 52 times + 1 extra (for the week starting on January 7).
     - Friday (5) occurs 52 times + 1 extra (for the week starting on January 1).
     - Saturday (6) occurs 52 times + 1 extra (for the week starting on January 2).
     - Sunday (7) occurs 52 times + 1 extra (for the week starting on January 3).
   
3. For "x of month", the output should be the number of months that have that specific day:
   - Day 30 is present in 11 months (all except February).
   - Day 31 is present in 7 months (January, March, May, July, August, October, December).
   - Day 29 is present in February (1 month), and day 28 is present in all months (12 months).
   - Day 1 is present in all months (12 months).

### Code Analysis:
The program reads the input and has a single line of logic based on the format detected in the input:

```python
s = raw_input()
print(52 + (int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)) if s[5] == 'w' else 12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4
```

- **For "x of week":**
  - The expression `(int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)` seems to be an incorrect way to check for the extra occurrences of days. `int(s[0])` extracts the day number, but the logic does not correctly account for the extra occurrences of each day of the week.
  
- **For "x of month":**
  - The logic `12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4` is also flawed. It subtracts 1 if the day is 3 (which corresponds to February's 29), and subtracts 4 if the day is 31, which is incorrect because it should only subtract the number of months that do not have a 31st day (which is February only).

### Potential Cases for Incorrectness:
1. For "4 of week" (Thursday), the correct output should be 53 (52 + 1).
2. For "30 of month", the output should be 11 (as there are 11 months with a 30th day), but the logic is incorrectly coded.
3. For "31 of month", the output should be 7 (only January, March, May, July, August, October, December have a 31st day), but the logic does not reflect this.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for both input formats. There are multiple cases where the output would not match the expected results.

Correctness: **False**.
