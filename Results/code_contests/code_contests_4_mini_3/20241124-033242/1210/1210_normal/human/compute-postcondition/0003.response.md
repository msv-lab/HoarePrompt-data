Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input of at least 6 characters. It processes the first character as an integer and checks the sixth character of the input. If the sixth character is 'w', it evaluates an expression based on the first character and returns 52 or a value calculated from the first two characters if it's not 'w'. The function does not handle cases where the input string is shorter than 6 characters or where the first character is not a valid integer, which could lead to exceptions. **
