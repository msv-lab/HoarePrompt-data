Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input, expected to be in the format "x of week" or "x of month", where `x` is an integer. It performs calculations based on the first character of the input string and the sixth character. If the sixth character is 'w', it evaluates a condition involving the first character of the input. If not, it performs a different calculation based on both the first two characters and the first character. The function does not handle invalid input formats and may raise exceptions if the input string is shorter than 6 characters or if the first character cannot be converted to an integer. **
