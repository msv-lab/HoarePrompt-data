The function `func` accepts an input that is a string in the format "x of week" or "x of month", where `x` is an integer. Specifically, `x` must satisfy the following conditions: for "x of week", `x` must be between 1 and 7, and for "x of month", `x` must be between 1 and 31. After executing the function body, it processes this input string accordingly. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string input that indicates a specific day either of the week or of the month, ensuring that the integer `x` is within the specified ranges. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string input in the format "x of week" or "x of month", where x is an integer between 1 and 7 for days of the week or between 1 and 31 for days of the month.**
