To analyze the provided program, we need to determine if it correctly calculates the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016 based on the input format described.

The program uses the following logic:
1. It checks if the input corresponds to "x of week."
2. If true, it calculates the number of candies saved based on the day of the week:
   - It adds 52 (the number of weeks in a year) and checks if the day corresponds to Thursday (the 4th day of the week) using the expression `(int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)`, which essentially evaluates to 1 if the input is "4 of week" (which is Thursday) and 0 otherwise.
3. If the input corresponds to "x of month," it calculates the number of candies saved based on the day of the month:
   - It starts with 12 and subtracts 1 if the day is the 3rd (since February has only 28 days), and subtracts 4 if the day is the 31st (since only 7 months have 31 days).

Now, let's analyze the potential cases:

1. For the input "4 of week":
   - Expected output: 52 (correctly calculates the number of Thursdays in 2016).
   - The program outputs 52, which is correct.

2. For the input "30 of month":
   - Expected output: 11 (correctly counts the months that have a 30th day).
   - The program calculates 12 - (0) - (0) = 12, but it should subtract 1 for February, resulting in 11 (correct). However, the logic here is flawed because it does not correctly account for the 30th day in the month.

3. For the input "31 of month":
   - Expected output: 7 (as only 7 months have 31 days).
   - The program will output 12 - (0) - (1 * 4) = 8. This is incorrect because it should output 7.

4. For the input "3 of month":
   - Expected output: 12 (as every month has at least 3 days).
   - The program will output 12 - (1) - (0) = 11, which is incorrect.

Given these findings, we can see that the program does not handle several cases correctly, particularly for inputs related to "x of month." 

Correctness: **False**
- The program fails to correctly calculate the number of candies for some valid inputs according to the problem description, such as "31 of month" and "3 of month."
