Postcondition: ***`min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1, while `r` remains 0. If the character at index `i` is not 'D', then `u` remains unchanged (either 1 or 0 depending on whether it was set previously) and `r` remains 0.***
