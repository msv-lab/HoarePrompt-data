You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers such that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9 and (x1, y1) is not equal to (x2, y2); n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns None. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, there is no action taken, and the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged.

Case_2: *`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists containing [r, u]; `dist` is calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1 and returns, indicating a non-positive distance. If `dist` is greater than 0, the program does not print or return anything, and no changes are made to the state of the variables.

Case_3: `min_dist` is set to the minimum distance after evaluating the movements defined in `s`, `i` will be less than `n`, and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. If `dist` becomes less than or equal to 0 at any point, the program prints `i + 1` and returns, exiting the loop. If `n` is 1 or lower, the loop does not execute, leaving `min_dist` unchanged as the initial value which is equal to `dist`.

Case_4: *`moves_toward` is calculated as abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - (abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n). If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the function does not print or return any value.

Case_5: *`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, and `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`. If the Manhattan distance between (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `res` and returns; otherwise, there are no changes made to the program state.

Case_6: `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range from 0 to `n-1` during loop execution, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the output will be `res + i + 1` and the function will return. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `x1`, `y1`, and other variables remain unchanged from their updated values. If `dist` is never less than or equal to 0 throughout the loop, there will be no output or return, and the final state will reflect the last values of `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` calculated.

Case_7: The program does not return any value; the final state reflects the updated values of `x1`, `y1`, `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` after the loop execution, if applicable.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
