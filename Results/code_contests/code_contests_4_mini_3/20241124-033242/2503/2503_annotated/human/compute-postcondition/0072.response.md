Postcondition: ***`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and the distance `dist` is less than or equal to 0, calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`***
