The value of `res` is assigned the result of the expression `n * cycles`. The value of `n` is unknown, and `cycles` is determined by the expression `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`. Since `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the calculation of `cycles` will yield a valid integer value. Therefore, `res` will be the product of the unknown `n` and the computed `cycles`. 

The output state reflects that `moves_toward` is greater than 0, and `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0; `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`**
