The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`. The value of `dist` is calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1, where r and u come from the lists in `pref_sums`. Since the output state does not specify the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, and `pref_sums`, we cannot determine the specific value of `dist`. However, we note that the assignment of `min_dist` takes place regardless of the specific values.

Therefore, the output state mentions that `min_dist` is set to `dist` based on the calculations, but we cannot provide specific values for `dist`.

Output State: **`min_dist` is set to `dist` (calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1)**
