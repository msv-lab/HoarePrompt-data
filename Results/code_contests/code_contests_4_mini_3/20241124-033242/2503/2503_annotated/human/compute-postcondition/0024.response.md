To evaluate the impact of the given code snippet, we will first analyze the variables involved:

1. **Initial Variables**: 
   - `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists containing [r, u].
   - `new_x` is defined as `x1 + r`.
   - `new_y` is defined as `y1 + u`.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   The code calculates the value of `dist` using the formula:
   ```
   dist = abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1
   ```

   To compute `dist`, we need the values of `new_x` and `new_y`, which depend on `r` and `u` from `pref_sums`. Since `pref_sums` contains `n` lists, we need to derive values of `r` and `u` from one of these lists (typically the first list if no specific index is provided).

3. **Calculation**:
   Assuming we use the first list in `pref_sums` for `r` and `u`, we can express:
   - Let `r = pref_sums[0][0]`
   - Let `u = pref_sums[0][1]`
   - Then, substitute `new_x` and `new_y`:
     - `new_x = x1 + r`
     - `new_y = y1 + u`

   Therefore, the expression for `dist` becomes:
   ```
   dist = abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1
   ```

4. **Output State**:
   The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `pref_sums` remain unchanged, but `dist` is computed based on the above formula. 

The output state will thus reflect the unchanged variables and the computed `dist` based on the derived values.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists containing [r, u]; `dist` is calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1**
