The variable `dist` is assigned the value calculated from the formula `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - 1`. The values of `new_x` and `new_y` depend on the previously calculated values `x1`, `y1`, and the `pref_sums[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which suggests that there are further indices available in `pref_sums`. The state of `min_dist` remains unchanged as it is initially set to `dist`.

Thus, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables without altering `min_dist`:

Output State: **`min_dist` is set to `dist`; `i` is 1; `n` is >= 2; `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - 1`.**
