According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, in order for the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1 - n * cycles - 1`.**
