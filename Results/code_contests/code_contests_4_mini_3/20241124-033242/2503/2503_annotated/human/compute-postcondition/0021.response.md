Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing [0, 0]; if the first character of `s` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1; otherwise, `r` remains unchanged. The variable `u` remains unchanged regardless of the value of the first character of `s`.***
