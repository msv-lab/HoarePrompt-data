Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists containing [r, u]; `dist` is calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1 and returns, indicating a non-positive distance. If `dist` is greater than 0, the program does not print or return anything, and no changes are made to the state of the variables.***
