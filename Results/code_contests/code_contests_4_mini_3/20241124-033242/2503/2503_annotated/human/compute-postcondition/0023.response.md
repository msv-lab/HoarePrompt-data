To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state provided.

1. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers.
2. The variable `n` is an input integer.
3. The variable `s` is an input string.
4. The variable `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `[r, u]`.
5. The variable `r` is set to -1 if the first character of `s` is 'L', otherwise `r` remains unchanged.
6. The variable `u` remains unchanged.

Now, the code snippet provided is:
```
new_x, new_y = x1 + r, y1 + u
```

- The variable `new_x` is assigned the value `x1 + r`.
- The variable `new_y` is assigned the value `y1 + u`.

The values of `new_x` and `new_y` depend on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `r`, and `u`. The state of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, and `pref_sums` does not change aside from the computation of `new_x` and `new_y`.

Since `r` can potentially be -1 or another integer based on the condition of `s`, and `u` remains unchanged, the output state reflects the new values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on these calculations.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists containing [r, u]; `new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`.**
