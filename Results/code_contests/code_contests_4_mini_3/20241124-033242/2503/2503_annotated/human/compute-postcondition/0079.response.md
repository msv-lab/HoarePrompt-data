The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]` and `new_y` as `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`. The previous values of `x1` and `y1` are used for this calculation. The states of other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1 - n * cycles - 1`.**
