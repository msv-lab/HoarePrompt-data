The variable `u` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `u` was `0`, and this assignment updates its value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string where the first character of `s` is 'U'; `pref_sums` is a list of n lists, each containing [0, 0]; `u` is 1; `r` is 0.
