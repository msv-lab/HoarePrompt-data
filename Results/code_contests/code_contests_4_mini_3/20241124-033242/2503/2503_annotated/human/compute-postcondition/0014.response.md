The value of `u` is assigned to -1. The states of the other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, `pref_sums`, and `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of n lists, each containing [0, 0]; the first character of `s` is 'D'; `u` is -1 and `r` is unchanged.
