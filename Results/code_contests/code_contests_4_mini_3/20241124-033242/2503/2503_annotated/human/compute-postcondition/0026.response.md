The code executes a print statement which outputs the integer `1`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists containing [r, u]; `dist` is calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1, and `dist` is less than or equal to 0, and the function prints 1.**
