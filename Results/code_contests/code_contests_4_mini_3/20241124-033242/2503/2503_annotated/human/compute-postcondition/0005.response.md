Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns None. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, there is no action taken, and the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged.***
