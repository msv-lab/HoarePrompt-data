Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing [0, 0]; if the first character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1 and `u` remains unchanged; if the first character of `s` is not 'R', `r` remains unchanged and `u` remains unchanged.***
