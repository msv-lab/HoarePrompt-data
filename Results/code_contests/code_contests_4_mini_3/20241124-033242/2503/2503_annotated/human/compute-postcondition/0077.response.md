Output State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1 - n * cycles - 1`.**
