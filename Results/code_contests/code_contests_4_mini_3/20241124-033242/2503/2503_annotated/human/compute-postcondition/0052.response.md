The values of `u` and `r` are initialized to 0. Other variables `min_dist`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `u` is 0, `r` is 0.

Output State: **`min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
