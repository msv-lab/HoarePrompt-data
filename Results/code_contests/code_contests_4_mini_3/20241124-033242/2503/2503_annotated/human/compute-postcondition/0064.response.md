The values of `x1` and `y1` are updated based on the calculations involving `cycles` and the last elements of `pref_sums`. The initial state indicates that `moves_toward` is greater than 0, which suggests that `cycles` is likely a positive integer. The values of `x1` and `y1` will be incremented by `cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]` and `cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, respectively. The specific values of `x1` and `y1` are not provided, but their new values will depend on the multiplication of `cycles` with the last values of `pref_sums`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to `x1` and `y1` based on the calculations performed. The output state does not specify the exact values of `x1` and `y1` since they are not provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0; `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`**
