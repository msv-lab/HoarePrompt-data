The function `func_2` accepts the parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, and `s`. Here are the details regarding the parameters and the output based on the specified cases:

1. `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers with constraints that ensure they are within the range of 0 to 10^9 and that the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are not equal.
2. `n` is a positive integer that must be between 1 and 100000.
3. `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.

The function executes several cases based on the input parameters:

- **Case 1**: If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns `None`. 
- **Case 2**: If either `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the function performs calculations involving the distance `dist` and prints 1 if `dist` is less than or equal to 0, but returns nothing otherwise.
- **Case 3**: If `dist` becomes less than or equal to 0 during the evaluation of movements, the function prints `i + 1` and returns, exiting the loop if `n` is at least 2.
- **Case 4**: If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns; otherwise, there are no changes made.
- **Case 5**: If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, certain updates are made to `x1` and `y1`, and if the Manhattan distance condition is met, the function prints `res` and returns; otherwise, no changes are made.
- **Case 6**: If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, additional updates occur to `x1` and `y1`, and if `dist` is less than or equal to 0 during the loop execution, the function outputs `res + i + 1` and returns.
- **Case 7**: The function does not return any value, and the final state reflects the updated coordinates and distance after executing the loop, if applicable.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 (all integers), n (a positive integer), and s (a string). It performs calculations based on the coordinates and returns outputs based on various conditions related to distance and movement, including printing specific values under certain conditions but does not have a final return value.**
