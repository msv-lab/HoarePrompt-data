The value of `r` is assigned -1, but the previous value of `r` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'L', `r` is -1, and `u` remains unchanged (either 1 or 0 depending on its previous state).**
