To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the impact of the code snippet.

Initial State: 
* `moves_toward` is calculated as abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - (abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n). 

Now, we need to consider the condition for `moves_toward`:

1. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns, which means no further calculations regarding `cycles` would take place.
2. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, it allows the calculation of `cycles`.

Assuming `moves_toward` is greater than 0 (since we're calculating `cycles`), we proceed with the calculation:

`cycles` is assigned the value of (abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward.

In this case, the variables affected are `cycles` and the already existing calculated value of `moves_toward`. We do not know the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `new_x`, `new_y`, or `min_dist`, but we indicate that `cycles` is now defined based on these calculations.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0; `cycles` is calculated as (abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward**
