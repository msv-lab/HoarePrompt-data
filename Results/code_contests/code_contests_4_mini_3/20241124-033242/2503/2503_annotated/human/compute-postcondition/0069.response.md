According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial conditions indicate that `moves_toward` is greater than 0, and `x1` and `y1` have been updated based on the calculations described. However, the check for the Manhattan distance does not influence the loop execution directly; it only affects subsequent behavior if the function returns early.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0 since it is the first iteration of the for loop.

State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
