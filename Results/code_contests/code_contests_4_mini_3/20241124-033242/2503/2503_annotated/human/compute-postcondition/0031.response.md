The variables `u` and `r` are both assigned the value of `0`. The previous values of `min_dist`, `i`, and `n` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `u` is 0, and `r` is 0.

Output State: **`min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
