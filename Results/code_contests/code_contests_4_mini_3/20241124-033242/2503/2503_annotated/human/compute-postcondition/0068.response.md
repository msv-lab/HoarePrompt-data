Postcondition: ***`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, and `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`. If the Manhattan distance between (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `res` and returns; otherwise, there are no changes made to the program state.***
