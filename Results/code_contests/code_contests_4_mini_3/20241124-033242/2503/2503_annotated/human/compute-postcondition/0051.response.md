According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 and going up to `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n - 1`, which implies `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 2`. Since `i` is currently 1, it means that for `n` to allow another iteration, `n` must be at least 3 (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 2 to allow `i` to increment to 2 in the next iteration.
- `i` will increment to 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
