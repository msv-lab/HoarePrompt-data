According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. However, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the next iteration's state. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` needs to be updated to 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is still valid since `n` is greater than 0. There's no need to adjust `n` or any other states since they remain unchanged during the iterations.

State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`.**
