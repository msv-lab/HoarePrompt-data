Postcondition: ***`min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1 and `u` remains unchanged. If the character at index `i` is not 'L', then `r` remains unchanged (either 1, if it was set previously due to 'R', or 0) and `u` also remains unchanged.***
