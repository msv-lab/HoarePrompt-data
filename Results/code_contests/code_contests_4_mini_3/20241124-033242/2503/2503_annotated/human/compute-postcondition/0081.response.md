Output State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range from 0 to `n-1` during loop execution, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the output will be `res + i + 1` and the function will return. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `x1`, `y1`, and other variables remain unchanged from their updated values. If `dist` is never less than or equal to 0 throughout the loop, there will be no output or return, and the final state will reflect the last values of `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` calculated.**
