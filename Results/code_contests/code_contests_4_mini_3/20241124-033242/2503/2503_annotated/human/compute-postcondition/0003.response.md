The `print(0)` statement outputs the value `0` to the console. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged as this statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` is an integer, `y1` is an integer, `x2` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and the output is `0`.

Output State: **`x1` is an integer, `y1` is an integer, `x2` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and the output is 0**
