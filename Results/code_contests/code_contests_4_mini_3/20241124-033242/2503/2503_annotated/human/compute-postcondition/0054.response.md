The code assigns the values 0 to both `u` and `r`. The previous values of `u` and `r` are both 0, so they remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `u` is 0, `r` is 0.

Output State: **`min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
