The value of `r` is assigned to 1. The previous value of `r` was 0, but it is now updated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'R', `u` is unchanged, and `r` is now 1.
