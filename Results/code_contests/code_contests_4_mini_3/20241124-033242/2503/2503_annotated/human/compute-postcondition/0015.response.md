Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of n lists, each containing [0, 0]; if the first character of `s` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1 while `r` remains unchanged; if the first character of `s` is not 'D', then `u` remains unchanged and `r` remains unchanged.***
