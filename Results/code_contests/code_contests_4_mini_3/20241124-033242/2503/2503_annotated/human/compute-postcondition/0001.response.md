The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The previously assigned values of `x1` and `y1` from input are unchanged, and `n` and `s` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `x2` and `y2` are now assigned the new input integer values.

Output State: **`x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is now an input integer, `y2` is now an input integer, `n` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged**.
