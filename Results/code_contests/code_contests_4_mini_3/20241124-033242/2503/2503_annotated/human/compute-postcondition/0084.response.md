Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), a positive integer n, and a string s consisting of n characters representing movements ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). It first checks if the two coordinates are the same and prints 0 if they are. It then calculates the minimum distance between the initial point (x1, y1) and the target point (x2, y2) after performing the movements indicated by the string s. If at any point the distance becomes zero or negative, it prints the number of movements taken to reach or surpass the target. Additionally, if the function determines that the target cannot be reached, it prints -1. The function does not have a return statement, so it implicitly returns None.**
