According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but not including) `n`. Additionally, the variable `i` needs to start at 1 when the loop begins. The calculation of `min_dist` does not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but it is important to note that it is set before the loop starts. 

For the loop to be executed, the following conditions must be met: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`min_dist` is set to `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
