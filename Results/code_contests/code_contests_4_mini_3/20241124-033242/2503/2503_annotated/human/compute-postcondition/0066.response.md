The `print(res)` statement outputs the value of the variable `res`. The output does not change the state of any other variables. Therefore, the output state takes into account that `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` have been updated, and the condition regarding the sum of absolute differences holds true. However, the specific value of `res` is not provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0; `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`; the sum of the absolute differences `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)` is less than or equal to `n * cycles`; the function prints `res`.**
