Output State: **`min_dist` is set to the minimum distance after evaluating the movements defined in `s`, `i` will be less than `n`, and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. If `dist` becomes less than or equal to 0 at any point, the program prints `i + 1` and returns, exiting the loop. If `n` is 1 or lower, the loop does not execute, leaving `min_dist` unchanged as the initial value which is equal to `dist`.**
