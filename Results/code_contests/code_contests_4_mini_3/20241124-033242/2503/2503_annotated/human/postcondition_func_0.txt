The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, it returns `x` as the GCD. The function correctly handles cases where `y` is negative or zero, ensuring the GCD is computed accurately regardless of the initial values.
