(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are pairs of integers representing the initial and destination coordinates on a Cartesian plane where 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9; n is a positive integer representing the length of the wind direction string s (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); s is a string consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
