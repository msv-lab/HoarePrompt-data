The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: 

- Two pairs of integers `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` representing the initial and destination coordinates on a Cartesian plane. The constraints for these integers are that they must satisfy `0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9`.
- An integer `n`, which is a positive integer representing the length of the wind direction string `s`. The constraints are `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.
- A string `s` that consists only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.

Based on the output cases:

- **Case 1**: If `(x1, y1)` is equal to `(x2, y2)`, the function prints `0` and returns `None`.
- **Case 2**: If the calculated distance `dist` is less than or equal to `0` after the first movement, the function prints `1` and completes without returning a value.
- **Case 3**: If the distance after the final calculation is less than or equal to `0`, it prints `n` and returns. If the distance is greater than `0`, the function proceeds to find the minimum distance.
- **Case 4**: If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to `0`, it prints `-1` and returns `None`. If `moves_toward` is greater than `0`, the function continues without changes to the state.
- **Case 5**: The function checks if a specific condition on the distance is met and may print `res` and return `None`.
- **Case 6**: In this case, the function potentially modifies `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` based on the loop iterations. If certain conditions are met during these iterations, it may print a result and return immediately.
- **Case 7**: If no action is taken or no value is modified during execution, the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two pairs of integers representing coordinates, a positive integer indicating the length of a wind direction string, and the string itself, and then perform a series of checks and calculations based on the input before possibly printing results and returning `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two pairs of integers `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s`. It evaluates conditions based on these inputs, printing various outputs like `0`, `1`, `n`, `-1`, or a calculated result before returning `None`.**
