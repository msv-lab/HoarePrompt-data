The `print(1)` statement outputs the value `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1, and the value of `dist` is less than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1, and the value of `dist` is less than or equal to 0; the function prints 1**
