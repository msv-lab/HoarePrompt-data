According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 3 to allow for the next iteration.

The other states (`moves_toward`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist`) do not need to change based on the information provided.

State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`, `dist` remains unchanged, `min_dist` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3**
