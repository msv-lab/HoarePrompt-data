The code initializes a list called `pref_sums` using a list comprehension. The list comprehension creates a list of lists, where each inner list contains two zeros. The outer list is created with a length of `n`, which is an input integer. Therefore, `pref_sums` will contain `n` inner lists, each of which is `[0, 0]`. 

The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `s` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` and `y1` are input integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two zeros.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are input integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two zeros.**
