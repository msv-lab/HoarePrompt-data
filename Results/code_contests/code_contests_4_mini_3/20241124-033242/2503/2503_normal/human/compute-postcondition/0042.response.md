The value of `r` is assigned `-1`, which updates its previous value of `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'L', `r` is -1, and `u` retains its previous value.
