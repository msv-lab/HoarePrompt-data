The value of `u` is assigned 1, which changes its previous value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is 1, `r` is 0, and the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'U'.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is 1, `r` is 0, and the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'U'**.
