Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are input integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string. If the first character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1 while `u` remains unchanged (0 if the first character is 'U', -1 if 'D'). If the first character of `s` is not 'R', `r` remains 0, and `u` still retains its value (0 if 'U', -1 if 'D'). The list `pref_sums` consists of `n` lists, each containing two zeros.***
