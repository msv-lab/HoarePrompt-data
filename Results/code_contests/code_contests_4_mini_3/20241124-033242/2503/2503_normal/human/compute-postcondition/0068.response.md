Postcondition: ***`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, `res` is not calculated. If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res` and returns None. Otherwise, the program continues executing beyond this if statement without any changes to the state.***
