Postcondition: ***`new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1 and `u` remains 0. Otherwise, if the character at index `i` is not 'R', `r` remains 0 and `u` retains its previous value based on whether it was set to -1, 1, or 0. This ensures that all values of `u` and `r` are properly accounted for based on the character at index `i`.***
