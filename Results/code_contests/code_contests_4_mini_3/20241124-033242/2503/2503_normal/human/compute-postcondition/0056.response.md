Output State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[n-1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[n-1][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (n - 1)`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `n` and returns. If `dist` is greater than 0, `min_dist` is the minimum distance found during the iterations. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `new_x` is equal to `x1`, `new_y` is equal to `y1`, `dist` is the initial distance calculated, and `min_dist` remains as the initial value of `dist`.**
