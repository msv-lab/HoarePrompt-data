Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are input integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; if the first character of `s` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1 and `u` remains unchanged (0 if the first character of `s` is 'U', -1 if 'D'). If the first character of `s` is not 'L', then `r` remains 0 and `u` still retains its value (0 if 'U', -1 if 'D'). The list `pref_sums` consists of `n` lists, each containing two zeros.***
