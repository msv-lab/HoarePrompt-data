According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to 2 for the next iteration, while `n` remains greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `moves_toward`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` are not directly affected by the loop iteration conditions.

State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `dist` remains unchanged, `min_dist` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
