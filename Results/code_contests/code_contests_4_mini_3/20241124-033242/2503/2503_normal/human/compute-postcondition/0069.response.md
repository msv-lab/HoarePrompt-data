According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0 and does not affect the range of the loop, the critical factor for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is initialized at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, `res` is not calculated, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
