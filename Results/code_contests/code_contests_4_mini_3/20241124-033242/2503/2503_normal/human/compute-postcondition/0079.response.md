The values of `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned based on the calculations involving `x1` and the elements of `pref_sums` at index `i`. Given that `i` is 2, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]` and `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`. The other variables (`moves_toward`, `dist`, `min_dist`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates the new values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on the calculations.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`, `dist` remains unchanged, `min_dist` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
