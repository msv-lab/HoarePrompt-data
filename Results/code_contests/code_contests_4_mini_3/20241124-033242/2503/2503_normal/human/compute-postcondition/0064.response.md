The values of `x1` and `y1` are updated based on the calculations involving `cycles` and the last element of `pref_sums`. The variables `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, and `res` is still not calculated. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `x1` and `y1`, which are incremented by `cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]` and `cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, respectively.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, `res` is not calculated, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`**
