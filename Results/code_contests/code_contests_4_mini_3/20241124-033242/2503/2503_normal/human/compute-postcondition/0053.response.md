According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`, and the loop starts with `i` being incremented for each iteration starting from 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3 and `n` must still be greater than 3. Thus, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 3 to allow the loop to run again.

State: **`u` is 0, `r` is 0, `pref_sums[i]` remains unchanged, `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 2`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3**
