The `print` statement outputs the value of `res + i + 1`. The value of `res` is not calculated, but `i` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `res + 0 + 1`, which is `res + 1`. Since `res` is not defined, we cannot determine its value, but we know it will be printed alongside `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as x1 + pref_sums[0][0], `new_y` is calculated as y1 + pref_sums[0][1], `dist` is less than or equal to 0, `min_dist` remains unchanged, `res` is not calculated, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the output will be `res + 1`**.
