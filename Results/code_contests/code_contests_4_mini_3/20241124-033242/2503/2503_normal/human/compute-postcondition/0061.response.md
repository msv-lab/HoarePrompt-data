Postcondition: ***If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the program continues execution past the if statement. In either case, the values of `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged from their calculated states before the if statement, with `new_x` being equal to `x1 + pref_sums[n-1][0]`, `new_y` being equal to `y1 + pref_sums[n-1][1]`, and `dist` calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (n - 1)`. Additionally, if `n` is less than or equal to 1, `moves_toward` will also reflect that no iterations have taken place.***
