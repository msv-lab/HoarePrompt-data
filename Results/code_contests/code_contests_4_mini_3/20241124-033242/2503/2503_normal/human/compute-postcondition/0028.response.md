Postcondition: ***`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, where `u` is either 0 (if `s[0]` is not 'L') or -1 (if `s[0]` is 'L'). The variable `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints 1 and completes without a return value.***
