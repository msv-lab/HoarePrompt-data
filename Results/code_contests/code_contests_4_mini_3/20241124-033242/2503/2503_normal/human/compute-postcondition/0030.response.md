According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to execute for `i` starting from 1 and going up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. The variables `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` are not directly relevant for the loop execution but are important for the loop's body calculations. At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
