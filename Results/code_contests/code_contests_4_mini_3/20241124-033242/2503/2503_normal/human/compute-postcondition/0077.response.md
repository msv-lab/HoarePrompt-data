The values of `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, and the `pref_sums` array at index `i`. Since `i` is 1, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]` and `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`. The values of `moves_toward`, `dist`, `min_dist`, and `n` remain unchanged, while `i` is now 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on the calculations.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `dist` remains unchanged, `min_dist` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
