Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as x1 + pref_sums[0][0], `new_y` is calculated as y1 + pref_sums[0][1], `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1, `min_dist` remains unchanged, `res` is not calculated, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
