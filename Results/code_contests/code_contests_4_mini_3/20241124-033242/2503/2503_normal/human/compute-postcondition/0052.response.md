The values of `u` and `r` are assigned as 0. The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are not directly affected by this assignment as their values are already determined based on the initial state. However, the `pref_sums[i]` is updated to [pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u]. Since both `u` and `r` are 0, the values in `pref_sums[i]` will remain unchanged from `pref_sums[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `pref_sums[i]` remains unchanged, `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 2`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`u` is 0, `r` is 0, `pref_sums[i]` remains unchanged, `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 2`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**.
