Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, `res` is not calculated, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, and the sum of the absolute differences `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)` is less than or equal to `n * cycles`, and `res` is printed.**
