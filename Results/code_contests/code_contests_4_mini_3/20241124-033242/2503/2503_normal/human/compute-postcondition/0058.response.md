Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[n-1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[n-1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (n - 1)`, `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `n` and returns; if `dist` is greater than 0, `min_dist` is the minimum distance found during the iterations, and `min_dist` remains as the initial value of `dist` if `n` is less than or equal to 1.***
