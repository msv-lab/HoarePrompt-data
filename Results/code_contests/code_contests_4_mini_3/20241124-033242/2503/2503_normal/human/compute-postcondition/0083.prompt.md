You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are pairs of integers representing the initial and destination coordinates on a Cartesian plane where 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9; n is a positive integer representing the length of the wind direction string s (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); s is a string consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`x1` and `y1` are input integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns None. Since there is no else part, the state of the program remains unchanged if the condition is not met.

Case_2: *`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, where `u` is either 0 (if `s[0]` is not 'L') or -1 (if `s[0]` is 'L'). The variable `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints 1 and completes without a return value.

Case_3: `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[n-1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[n-1][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (n - 1)`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `n` and returns. If `dist` is greater than 0, `min_dist` is the minimum distance found during the iterations. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `new_x` is equal to `x1`, `new_y` is equal to `y1`, `dist` is the initial distance calculated, and `min_dist` remains as the initial value of `dist`.

Case_4: *If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the program continues execution past the if statement. In either case, the values of `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged from their calculated states before the if statement, with `new_x` being equal to `x1 + pref_sums[n-1][0]`, `new_y` being equal to `y1 + pref_sums[n-1][1]`, and `dist` calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (n - 1)`. Additionally, if `n` is less than or equal to 1, `moves_toward` will also reflect that no iterations have taken place.

Case_5: *`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, `res` is not calculated. If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res` and returns None. Otherwise, the program continues executing beyond this if statement without any changes to the state.

Case_6: `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`, `min_dist` remains unchanged, and `i` is in the range from 0 to n-1. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, with no action taken. If `dist` becomes less than or equal to 0 during any iteration, the program prints `res + i + 1` and returns immediately. If `dist` remains greater than 0 for all iterations, no action occurs and the loop completes without modifying `res`.

Case_7: The program returns None, as there is no action taken or value modified during the execution.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
