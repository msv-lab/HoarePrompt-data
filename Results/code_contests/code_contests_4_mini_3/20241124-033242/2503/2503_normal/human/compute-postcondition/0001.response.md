The variables `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from the input after being converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `x1` and `y1` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The output state reflects the new values for `x2` and `y2`, which are the input integers received.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are assigned input integer values; `x2` and `y2` are input integers.**
