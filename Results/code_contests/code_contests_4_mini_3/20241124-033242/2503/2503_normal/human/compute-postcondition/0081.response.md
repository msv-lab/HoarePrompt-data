Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`, `min_dist` remains unchanged, and `i` is in the range from 0 to n-1. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, with no action taken. If `dist` becomes less than or equal to 0 during any iteration, the program prints `res + i + 1` and returns immediately. If `dist` remains greater than 0 for all iterations, no action occurs and the loop completes without modifying `res`.**
