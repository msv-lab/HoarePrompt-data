Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are input integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string. If the first character of `s` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1, while `r` remains 0 throughout the execution. If the first character of `s` is not 'D', `u` remains unchanged (0 if the first character is 'U'), and `r` is still 0. The list `pref_sums` consists of `n` lists, each containing two zeros.***
