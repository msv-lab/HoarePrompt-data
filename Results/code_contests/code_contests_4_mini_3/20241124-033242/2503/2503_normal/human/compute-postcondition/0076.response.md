According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

However, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2, allowing `i` to be 1 in the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted based on the provided information.

State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1 - n * cycles - 1`, `min_dist` remains unchanged, and `i` is 1 with `n` greater than 1**
