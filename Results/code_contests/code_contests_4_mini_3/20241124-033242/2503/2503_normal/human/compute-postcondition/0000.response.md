The code snippet takes input values for `x1` and `y1`, which represent the initial coordinates on a Cartesian plane. The `map(int, input().split())` function will read a line of input, split it into separate strings, convert those strings to integers, and then assign them to `x1` and `y1`.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `x1` and `y1`, they are now assigned integer values from the input. The output state will reflect that `x1` and `y1` have been set to input values.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are assigned input integer values**
