Postcondition: ***`new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1. If the character is not 'D', `u` remains 1 if it was 'U', or 0 otherwise, and `r` is 0.***
