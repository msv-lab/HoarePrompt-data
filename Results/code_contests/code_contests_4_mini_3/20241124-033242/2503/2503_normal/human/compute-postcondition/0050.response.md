Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `i + 1` and returns. If `dist` is greater than 0, the program continues execution without printing or returning. Additionally, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `pref_sums[i]` is updated to [pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u].*
