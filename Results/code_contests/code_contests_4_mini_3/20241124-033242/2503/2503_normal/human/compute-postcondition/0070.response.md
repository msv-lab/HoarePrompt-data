The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned values based on the expressions involving `x1` and the elements of `pref_sums[i]`. Since `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, we do not have any changes to that variable, nor do we have changes to `dist`, `min_dist`, or `res`. The value of `i` is currently 0, and `n` is greater than 0, which means that `pref_sums` exists and the operation can be performed. The output reflects the new values of `new_x` and `new_y`, which depend on the values of `x1` and the first index of `pref_sums`.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as x1 + pref_sums[0][0], `new_y` is calculated as y1 + pref_sums[0][1], `dist` and `min_dist` remain unchanged, `res` is not calculated, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
