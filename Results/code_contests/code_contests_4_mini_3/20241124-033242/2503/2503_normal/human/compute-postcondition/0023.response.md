The variable `new_x` is assigned the value of `x1 + r`, and `new_y` is assigned the value of `y1 + u`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `r` are not specified in the initial state, while `u` can be either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `s[0]`. Therefore, the specific output state cannot be determined without knowing the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `r`. However, we can summarize the possible outcomes based on the initial state of `pref_sums[0]`.

If `s[0]` is 'L', then `pref_sums[0]` is `[-1, u]`, and `u` is -1. If `s[0]` is not 'L', then `pref_sums[0]` is `[0, u]`, and `u` is either 0 or -1. The output states for `new_x` and `new_y` depend on these conditions.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, where `u` is either 0 (if `s[0]` is not 'L') or -1 (if `s[0]` is 'L')**
