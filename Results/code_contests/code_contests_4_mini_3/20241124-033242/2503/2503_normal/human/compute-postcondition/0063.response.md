The variable `res` is assigned the value of `n * cycles`. However, since `cycles` is not calculated due to the condition that `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, we cannot determine a specific value for `res`. The other variables (`new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, and `res` is not calculated.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged, and `res` is not calculated.**
