The values of `u` and `r` are both assigned to 0. This does not change any of the previously defined variables, but it does mean that the calculations involving `new_x` and `new_y` will no longer include any contributions from `r` and `u`. The values of `new_x` and `new_y` will remain as they were defined earlier, but now they can be explicitly stated as `new_x` is `x1 + 0` (which simplifies to `x1`) and `new_y` is `y1 + 0` (which simplifies to `y1`). 

The value of `dist` remains calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. Since `new_x` and `new_y` have not changed in their definitions from their initial state, `min_dist` continues to hold the value of `dist`.

Other variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `u` and `r` are both 0.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `u` and `r` are both 0**
