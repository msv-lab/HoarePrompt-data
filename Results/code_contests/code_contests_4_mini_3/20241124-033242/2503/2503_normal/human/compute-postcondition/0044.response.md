The code assigns a new value to `pref_sums[i]`, which is an array where the first element is the sum of the previous first element of `pref_sums[i - 1]` and `r`, and the second element is the sum of the previous second element of `pref_sums[i - 1]` and `u`. The variables `r` and `u` retain their previous values based on the conditions provided regarding the character at index `i`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `pref_sums[i]` is updated to [pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u]**
