The value of `u` is assigned -1, changing its previous value of 0. The other variables `x1`, `y1`, `n`, `s`, `r`, and `pref_sums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` and `y1` are input integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `u` is -1; `r` is 0; the first character of `s` is 'D'; the list `pref_sums` consists of `n` lists, each containing two zeros.
