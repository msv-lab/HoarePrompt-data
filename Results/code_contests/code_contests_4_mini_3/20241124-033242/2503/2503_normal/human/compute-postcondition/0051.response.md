According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute at least one more time. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it is sufficient to say that `n` remains greater than 2 for the loop to continue. 

No other states need to be adjusted based on the provided postcondition.

State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 2`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `pref_sums[i]` is updated to [pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u].**
