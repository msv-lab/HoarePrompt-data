The value of `r` is assigned to -1. The previous value of `r` was 0, but now it is changed to -1. The other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `n`, `s`, `u`, and `pref_sums`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `r`.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are input integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `r` is -1; `u` is unchanged (0 if the first character of `s` is 'U', -1 if 'D'); and the first character of `s` is 'L'; the list `pref_sums` consists of `n` lists, each containing two zeros.**
