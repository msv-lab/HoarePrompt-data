Postcondition: ***`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`, `min_dist` remains unchanged, and `i` is 0 with `n` greater than 0. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res + i + 1` and returns. If `dist` is greater than 0, no action occurs and the program continues.***
