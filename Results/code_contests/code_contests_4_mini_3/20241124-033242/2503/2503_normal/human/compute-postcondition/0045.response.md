The values of `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned based on the current values of `x1`, `pref_sums[i][0]`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[i][1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `pref_sums[i]` has been updated to [pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u]. Thus, `new_x` becomes `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]` and `new_y` becomes `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`.

The states of other variables such as `dist`, `min_dist`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on the calculations.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `pref_sums[i]` is updated to [pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u]**.
