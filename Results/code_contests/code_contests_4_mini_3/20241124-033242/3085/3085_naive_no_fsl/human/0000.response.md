Correctness: **False**

The provided program has an incorrect implementation of the logic required to generate the permutation `p`. The main issue lies in how it constructs the sequence `a` and subsequently determines the permutation `p` without ensuring it meets the requirement of being lexicographically maximum while maintaining the inversion count. 

For example, consider the input case `n = 4` and `k = 3`. The sequence `a` should be `[1, 2, 3, 2]`. The number of inversions in `a` is 1. However, the program attempts to modify `a` incorrectly by updating its last few elements without correctly calculating the inversions after each modification. 

Additionally, the logic to derive `ans` does not guarantee that the resulting permutation `p` will always be lexicographically maximum, especially in cases where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`. 

For instance, when `n = 4` and `k = 3`, the correct permutation should be `[1, 3, 2]`, which is lexicographically maximum under the inversion constraints. However, due to the flawed logic in the program, it may produce an incorrect `p`, failing to meet the problem's requirements.

Thus, there are cases where the program does not work correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
