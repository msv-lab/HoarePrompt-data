Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `k` ≤ `n` < 2`k`. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range object representing numbers from 1 to `k - 2` (inclusive), followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, the function does not return anything.***
