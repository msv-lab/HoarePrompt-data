According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `k`, and `n`. The loop iterates from `2 * k - n` to `k`, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value, which is `k - 1` (the upper limit of the loop), since the loop ends at `k` (not inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`, which means it needs to be adjusted to `k - 1`.

To summarize:
- Since `i` is currently `k - 1`, it needs to be adjusted to `k`.
- The starting condition for `i` needs to be adjusted from `2 * k - n` to a value that would allow the loop to execute again, which is likely to be `2 * k - n + 1` or a similar increment.

State: **`curInv` is assigned the result of func_8(a, n), `a` remains unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `i` is `k - 1`, and `n` is such that `2 * k - n` is less than `k` (i.e. `n` must be greater than `2 * k - k`).**
