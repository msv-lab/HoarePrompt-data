According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i`, `k`, and `n`. The loop will execute if the starting value of `i` (which is `2 * k - n`) is less than `k`. 

To ensure this, we have to check the condition:
- `2 * k - n < k` simplifies to `k > n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than `n`. 

At the start of the loop:
- `i` will be initialized to `2 * k - n`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that:
- `k` is greater than `n`, 
- `i` is initialized to `2 * k - n`, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`a` is a range object containing numbers from 1 to `k`, `n` is unchanged, `maxInv` is assigned a value from func_8(a, n), `k` is greater than `n`, `i` is `2 * k - n`**.
