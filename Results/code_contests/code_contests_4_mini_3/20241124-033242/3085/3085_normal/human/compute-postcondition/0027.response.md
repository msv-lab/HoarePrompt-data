Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and returns a range object representing numbers from 1 to `k` if `n` equals `k`. If `n` equals `k + 1`, it returns a range object from 1 to `k - 2`, followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If neither condition is met, the function may attempt to modify and return a list based on the values of `curInv` and `maxInv`, but it does not guarantee a return value in all cases. Specifically, if `2 * k - n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function does not return anything, indicating a potential edge case where no output is produced. **
