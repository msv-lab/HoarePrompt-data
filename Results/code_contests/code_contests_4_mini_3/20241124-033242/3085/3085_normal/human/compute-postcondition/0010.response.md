The code attempts to assign the value of `i` to the index `k - 1` of the range object `a`. Since `a` is a range object containing numbers from 1 to `k`, trying to assign a value to an index of a range object will result in an error because range objects are immutable. Therefore, no values change and an error occurs. 

Output State: **Error: Cannot assign to a range object**
