Postcondition: ***`curInv` is assigned the result of func_8(a, n), `a` remains unchanged, and `k` is unchanged. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function returns a list `ans` containing values from 1 to `k`, with the value of `k` placed at index `i - 1` and the value of `i` placed at index `k - 1`. If `curInv` is greater than `maxInv`, the function does not return anything.***
