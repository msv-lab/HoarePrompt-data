The variable `ans[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous state indicates that `ans` is a range from 1 to `k` (inclusive), which means it has at least `k` elements. The specific value of `i` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value that is assigned to `ans[k - 1]`. Other variables (`a`, `k`, `curInv`) remain unchanged, and we know that `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment that has taken place.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `curInv` is assigned the result of func_8(a, n) and is less than or equal to `maxInv`; `ans[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`.**
