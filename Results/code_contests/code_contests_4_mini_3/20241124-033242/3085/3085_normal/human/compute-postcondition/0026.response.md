The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It processes internal logic based on the integer constraints defined for `n`, `k`, and `t`. 

- In Case 1, if `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range object representing numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
- In Case 2, if `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range object representing numbers from 1 to `k - 2` (inclusive), followed by `k` and `k - 1`.
- In Case 3, if the condition `2 * k - n` is less than `k` is satisfied, the function may return a list `ans` based on the values of `curInv` and `maxInv`. If `2 * k - n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function does not return anything.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to evaluate integers `n` and `k` based on the defined cases and return specific range objects or lists based on the conditions met, while not accepting any external parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a range object or a list based on the values of `n` and `k` under specific conditions.**
