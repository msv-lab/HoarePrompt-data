The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `range(1, k + 1)`. The value of `k` remains unchanged, and since `range(1, k + 1)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to `k` (inclusive), `ans` will hold a range object representing this sequence. The values of `a`, `curInv`, and `maxInv` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `curInv` is assigned the result of func_8(a, n), and `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`; `ans` is a range from 1 to `k` (inclusive)**.
