Output State: **If `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, then the loop will execute at least once, updating `a[k - 1]` to `i`, and potentially returning a list `ans` based on the values of `curInv` and `maxInv`. If `2 * k - n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will not execute, and `a` will remain unchanged, `curInv` will not be assigned a new value, and the function will not return anything. In the case where `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` will contain values from 1 to `k`, with the value of `k` placed at index `i - 1` and the value of `i` placed at index `k - 1`.**
