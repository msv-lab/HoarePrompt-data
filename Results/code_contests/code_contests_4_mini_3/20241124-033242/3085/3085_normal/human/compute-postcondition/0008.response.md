To determine the output state, we note that `maxInv` is assigned the result of calling the function `func_8` with `a` (a range object containing numbers from 1 to `k`) and `n` as arguments. However, without additional information about the implementation of `func_8`, we cannot ascertain the specific value that `maxInv` will receive. The values of `a` and `n` are unchanged by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables involved and notes that a value has been assigned to `maxInv`.

Output State: **`a` is a range object containing numbers from 1 to `k`, `n` is unchanged, and `maxInv` is assigned a value from func_8(a, n)**
