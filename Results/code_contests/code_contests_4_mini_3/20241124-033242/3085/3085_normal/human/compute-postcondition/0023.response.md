The statement `a[k - 1] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the index `k - 1` of the list `a`. Since `i` is equal to `k - 1`, we can conclude that `a[k - 1]` will be updated to the same value that is already at that index. Therefore, there is no change to the list `a` at index `k - 1`. 

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `curInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` to `k - 1`, `k` is unchanged, `i` is `k - 1`, and `n` is such that `2 * k - n` is less than `k`.

Output State: **`curInv` is assigned the result of func_8(a, n), `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` to `k - 1`, `k` is unchanged, `i` is `k - 1`, and `n` is such that `2 * k - n` is less than `k`**.
