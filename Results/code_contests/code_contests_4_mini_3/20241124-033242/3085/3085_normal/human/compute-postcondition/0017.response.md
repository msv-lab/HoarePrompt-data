The code assigns the value of `k` to `ans[i - 1]`. The variable `ans` is updated at the index `i - 1`, and since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. The values of `a`, `k`, and `curInv` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans[i - 1]` now holds the value of `k`.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `curInv` is assigned the result of func_8(a, n) and is less than or equal to `maxInv`; `ans[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `k`.**
