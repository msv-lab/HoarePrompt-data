To analyze the code and determine the output state, we start with the initial state where `n` is equal to `k + 1`.

Given the condition that `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5` and `k ≤ n < 2k`, we can deduce that:

1. Since `n = k + 1`, this means `n` is always greater than `k` but less than `2k`.
2. The range function `range(1, k + 1 - 2)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 up to (but not including) `k - 1`.

Now, we need to evaluate `k + 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `k - 1`. Thus, `range(1, k + 1 - 2)` becomes `range(1, k - 1)`.

The output of this range will be all integers starting from 1 up to `k - 2`.

Next, we add the list `[k, k - 1]` to this range.

Thus, the final output will consist of the integers from `1` to `k - 2`, followed by `k` and `k - 1`.

Now, let's summarize this in the output state:

Output State: **The program returns the list of integers from 1 to k - 2, followed by k and k - 1**.
