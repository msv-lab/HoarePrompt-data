The operation `a[k - 1] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element at index `k - 1` of the array `a`. The previous value of `i` is `k - 1`, which is unchanged. The variable `curInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, but this does not affect the assignment operation. `a` remains the same except for the change at index `k - 1`. 

Therefore, the output state shows that the value at index `k - 1` of array `a` has been updated to `i`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curInv` is assigned the result of func_8(a, n), `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` to `i`, `k` is unchanged, `i` is `k - 1`, and `n` is such that `2 * k - n` is less than `k`.**
