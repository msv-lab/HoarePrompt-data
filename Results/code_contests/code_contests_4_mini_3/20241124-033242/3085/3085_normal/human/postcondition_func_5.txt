The function accepts a binary indexed tree (BITree) and an integer index, then returns the accumulated sum of values from BITree at specified indices determined by the decreasing value of index, which is reduced by its least significant bit in each iteration until index is 0. If the initial index is 0 or less, the function returns 0 without executing the loop.
