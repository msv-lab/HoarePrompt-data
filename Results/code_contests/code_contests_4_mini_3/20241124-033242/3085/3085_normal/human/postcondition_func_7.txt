The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`. It calculates the number of inversions in the array `arr` using helper functions `func_6` and `func_7`. If `n` is at least 1, it returns the total count of inversions; if `n` is 0 or less, it returns 0 since the loop does not execute, meaning no inversions can be counted.
