The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`. It calculates the number of inversions in the array `arr` by utilizing helper functions `func_6` and `func_7` to update and query a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT). If `n` is greater than 0, it returns the count of inversions; if `n` is 0 or less, it returns 0, as no inversions can exist in an empty or non-existent array.
