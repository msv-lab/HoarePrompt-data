The function accepts a binary indexed tree (BITree), an integer `n` indicating its size, an integer `index` representing the position to be updated, and an integer `val` that will be added to the value at the specified index. It updates the BITree by adding `val` to all relevant positions in the tree starting from `index` and continuing until `index` exceeds `n`. If `index` starts greater than `n`, the function does not modify BITree, and the value of `index` remains unchanged.
