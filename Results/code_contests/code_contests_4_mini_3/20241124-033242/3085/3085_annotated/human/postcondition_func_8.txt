The function accepts no parameters and calculates values based on integers `n` and `k`, which are obtained from an external function `func_2()`. It returns a range object of integers from 1 to `k` if `n` equals `k`; if `n` equals `k + 1`, it returns a list of integers from 1 to `k - 2` followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`, it attempts to find a valid configuration through a loop, modifying a list `ans` based on certain conditions, and returns this modified list if successful. If none of these conditions are met, the function does not return any value. The function may have edge cases where it does not return a value if `n` does not meet the specified conditions.
