The variable `a[k - 2]` is assigned the value of `k`. The previous values of the affected variables are `a[k - 1]` (which holds the value of `i`) and `k` (which is an integer). Since the assignment only affects `a[k - 2]`, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k â‰¤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n` (where `2 * k - n < k`), `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, and `a[k - 2]` is assigned the value of `k`.**
