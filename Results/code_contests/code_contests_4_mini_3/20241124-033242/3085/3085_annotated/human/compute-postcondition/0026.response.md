The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it utilizes the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` within its logic, which are assumed to be defined or provided in the context of its execution. The constraints for these variables are as follows: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`.

The function has multiple cases for its return values:

Case 1: If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range object representing the integers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, no value is returned from the function.

Case 2: If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range object representing the integers from 1 to `k - 2` followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, no value is returned from the function.

Case 3: If `n` is less than `k + 2`, the loop will not execute, and the function will not return any value. If `n` is at least `k + 2`, the function may return a list `ans` populated with certain values based on the logic within the loop, provided that a certain condition regarding `curInv` is satisfied. If no valid `curInv` is found during iterations, no value is returned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to evaluate the values of `n` and `k` in relation to each other and return different types of outputs based on specific conditions while handling multiple test cases.

Functionality: **The function evaluates integers `n` and `k` based on given conditions and returns a range object or a list of integers depending on the values of `n` and `k`. If conditions are not met, it does not return a value.**
