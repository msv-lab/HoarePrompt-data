The code snippet calls the function `func_8` with parameters `a` and `n`, where `a` is presumably a list or an array, and `n` is an integer. The function is expected to calculate and assign a value to `maxInv`, but since no value is returned from the function, it does not affect the output state directly. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged initial values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that `k â‰¤ n < 2k`, and no value is returned from the function.**
