The value of `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n` (where `2 * k - n < k`), `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, and `a[k - 2]` is assigned the value of `k`. The assignment of `a[k] = k` does not affect `t`, `n`, `i`, `a[k - 1]`, or `a[k - 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`**.
