The variable `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`. From the initial state, we have `i` as `2 * k - n + 1`. Therefore, `a[k - 1]` will take on the value of `2 * k - n + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `a[k - 1]`, which changes, and `i` which is calculated based on the values of `k` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, after the assignment:

- `a[k - 1]` is now `2 * k - n + 1`
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, and `a[k]` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `n â‰¥ k + 2`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`, `a[k - 1]` is `2 * k - n + 1`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`**
