Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k â‰¤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer. If `n` is less than `k + 2`, the loop will not execute, and `a` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `n` is at least `k + 2`, the loop will execute with `i` taking values from `2 * k - n` to `k - 1`. For each iteration, `a[k - 1]` is set to `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is populated with values from 1 to `k`, where `ans[k - 1]` is `i` and `ans[i - 1]` is `k`, and the function returns `ans`. If no valid `curInv` is found during iterations, no value is returned.**
