To simulate the execution of the provided Python code given the initial state:

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`

The code snippet provided is:
```
curInv = func_8(a, n)
```

Now, analyzing the code step-by-step:
1. The function `func_8` is called with two arguments: the list `a` and the integer `n`.
2. The values of `a`, `n`, and any other variables outside of this call are not modified by this line of code.
3. The return value of `func_8(a, n)` is assigned to `curInv`, but since we do not have information on what `func_8` returns, we cannot determine the exact value of `curInv` or how it affects the other variables.

Since no variables are affected besides the assignment to `curInv`, and the return value is unknown, the output state remains unchanged regarding the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`; `curInv` is the return value of func_8(a, n)**
