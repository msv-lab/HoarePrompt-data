The statement `ans[i - 1] = k` assigns the value of `k` to the index `i - 1` of the list `ans`. 

From the initial state:
- `i` is defined as `2 * k - n`.
- `k` is an integer.
- Therefore, `i - 1` is `2 * k - n - 1`.

Since `ans[k - 1]` is currently equal to `i`, we know that the value at index `k - 1` of the `ans` list is replaced by `k`. 

The assignment does not change the values of the other variables. 

Thus, the output state is:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `i` is `2 * k - n`.
- `a[k - 1]` is `i`.
- `a[k - 2]` is `k`.
- `a[k]` is `k`.
- `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`.
- `ans[k - 1]` is now equal to `k`, replacing the previous value `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, and `ans[k - 1]` is now equal to `k`**.
