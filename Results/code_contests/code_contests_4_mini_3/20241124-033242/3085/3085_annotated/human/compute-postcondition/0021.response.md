The statement `a[k - 1] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element at index `k - 1` of the array `a`. In the initial state, we have `i` as `2 * k - n + 1`.

Thus, the previous values are as follows:
- `a[k - 1]` will be updated to the value of `i`.
- The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

After executing the code, `a[k - 1]` now holds the value of `i`, which is `2 * k - n + 1`. The states of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will be:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k â‰¤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`, `a[k - 1]` is `2 * k - n + 1`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`**.
