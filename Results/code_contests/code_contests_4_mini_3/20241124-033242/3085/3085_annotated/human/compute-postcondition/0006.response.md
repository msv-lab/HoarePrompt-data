Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range object representing the integers from 1 to `k - 2` followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, no value is returned from the function.***
