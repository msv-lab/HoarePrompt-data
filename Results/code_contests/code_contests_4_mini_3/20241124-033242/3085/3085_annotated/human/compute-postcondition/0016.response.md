The value of `i` is assigned to the position `k - 1` in the list `ans`. Since `i` is `2 * k - n` and `ans` was previously a range object from 1 to `k` inclusive, the assignment modifies the specific index in `ans` to hold the value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, and `ans[k - 1]` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, and `ans[k - 1]` is now equal to `i`**.
