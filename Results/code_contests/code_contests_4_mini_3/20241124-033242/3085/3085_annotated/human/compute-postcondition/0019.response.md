Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k â‰¤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the array `ans` is returned such that `ans` contains values from 1 to `k`, with `ans[k - 1]` being `i` and `ans[i - 1]` being `k`. If `curInv` exceeds `maxInv`, the program does not return any value.***
