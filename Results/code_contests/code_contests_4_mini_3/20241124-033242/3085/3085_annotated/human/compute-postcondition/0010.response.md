The variable `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is computed as `2 * k - n`, and since it has been stated that `2 * k - n < k`, we know that `i` will also be less than `k`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n` (where `2 * k - n < k`), and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2 * k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n` (where `2 * k - n < k`), and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`**.
