The function accepts a list `BITree` and an integer `index`, and it computes the cumulative sum of elements in `BITree` corresponding to indices determined by the decreasing value of `index` until `index` becomes 0. If `index` is 0 or negative at the start, the function returns 0 without executing the loop.
