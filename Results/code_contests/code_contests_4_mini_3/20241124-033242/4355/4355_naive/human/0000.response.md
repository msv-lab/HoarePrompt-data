Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The first character's ASCII code is processed by reversing its binary representation.
2. For every subsequent character, the previous result (after processing the last character) is used to compute the current one.
3. The output must be the integers that were subtracted from the previous result to get the ASCII code of each character.

### Program Analysis:
```python
table = {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}
input = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
prev = 0
for c in input:
    s = '{0:0>{1}}'.format(bin(ord(c))[2:], 8)  # Get binary representation of ASCII
    binary = s[::-1]  # Reverse the binary string
    integer = int(binary, 2)  # Convert reversed binary to integer
    print(prev - integer) % 256  # Subtract and print the result
    prev = integer  # Update prev for the next iteration
```

### Issues with the Program:
1. The `print` statement is incorrectly formatted. The expression `print(prev - integer) % 256` will first print `prev - integer` and then the modulus operation will not affect the output. Instead, it should be enclosed in parentheses to ensure the modulus operation is applied before printing.
   
   The correct statement should be:
   ```python
   print((prev - integer) % 256)
   ```

### Potential Case Where It Fails:
If we consider the input `H`, the expected output should be `238` as described. However, due to the incorrect print statement, the output will be `prev - integer` without the modulus operation being applied to the printed value. 

For example:
- For first character 'H' (ASCII 72):
  - Binary: `01001000` (reversed: `00010010` -> 18)
  - Initial `prev = 0`, so output should be `(0 - 18) % 256 = 238`
  
However, the program will print `0 - 18`, which is `-18`, not the expected `238`.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect application of the modulus operator in the print statement, the program does not correctly implement the described logic for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
