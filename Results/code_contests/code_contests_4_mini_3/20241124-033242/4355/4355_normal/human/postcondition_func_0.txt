The function accepts no parameters and processes a string input read from standard input, which can contain between 1 and 100 characters. For each character in the input, it computes the integer value of the reversed binary representation of its ASCII code and prints the difference between the previous integer value and the current integer value modulo 256. The function maintains the last processed character's value to calculate the next difference but does not return any value. It does not handle empty input gracefully, as it assumes there will always be at least one character.
