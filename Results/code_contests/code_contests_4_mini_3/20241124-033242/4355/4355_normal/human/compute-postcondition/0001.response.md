The variable `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, which reads a line from standard input and removes any trailing whitespace. The initial state of `text` remains unchanged, but `input` will now hold the string input provided. The value of `text` is not directly affected, but since `input` is expected to be a string, it will also be a string. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `input` and the unchanged state of `text`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}; `input` is the input string from standard input**
