The variable `binary` is assigned the value of `s` reversed. The value of `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, which is the second character of `input`. As such, reversing `s` will not affect the values of any other variables. The initial values of the affected variables are `s` (an 8-character binary string) and `binary` (the reversed version of `s`). Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `text`, `table`, `input`, `prev`, `c`, `s`, `binary`, `integer`, and `result`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `prev` is `X`, `c` is the second character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, `binary` is the reversed value of `s`, `integer` is `X`, and the result is `(-X) % 256`.**
