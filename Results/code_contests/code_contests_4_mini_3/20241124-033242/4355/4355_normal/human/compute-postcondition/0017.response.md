The variable `binary` is assigned the value of `s` reversed. The variable `s` is defined as the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`. Therefore, `binary` will hold the reversed binary string. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}; `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `prev` is the new integer value; `c` is the third character of `input`; `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`; `binary` is the reversed string of `s`.**
