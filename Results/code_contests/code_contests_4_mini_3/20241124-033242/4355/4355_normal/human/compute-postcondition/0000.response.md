The variable `table` is assigned a dictionary that maps specific characters to their corresponding integer values. The previous variable `text` is unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged state of `text` and the new state of `table`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}**
