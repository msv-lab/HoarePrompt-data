The code snippet `prev = integer` assigns the value of `integer` to `prev`. The value of `integer` is derived from the computation involving the ASCII value of the third character of `input`. Since `prev` is being assigned the value of `integer`, the previous value of `prev` is replaced. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, `binary` is the reversed string of `s`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary`.**
