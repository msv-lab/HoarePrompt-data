The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`. The variable `integer` holds the value `X`, so after execution, `prev` will also be `X`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is `X`, `c` is the first character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, `binary` is the reversed value of `s`, `integer` is `X`, and the result is `(-X) % 256`.
