The variable `integer` is assigned the value obtained by converting `binary` from a binary string to an integer using base 2. The previous value of `binary` is the reversed 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`. Therefore, the value of `integer` will depend on the specific value of `binary`.

The output state is the following variables along with their values:

- `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters
- `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}
- `input` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters
- `prev` is `X`
- `c` is the second character of `input`
- `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`
- `binary` is the reversed value of `s`
- `integer` is now the integer value of `binary`

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `prev` is `X`, `c` is the second character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, `binary` is the reversed value of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`**.
