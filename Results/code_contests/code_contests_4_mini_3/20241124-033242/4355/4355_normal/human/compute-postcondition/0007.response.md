To determine the output state, we first analyze the impact of the code snippet provided.

1. The code snippet is `print(prev - integer) % 256`.
2. `prev` is given as 0.
3. `integer` is the integer equivalent of `binary`, which is derived from the reversed binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, which is the first character of `input`.
4. The result of `prev - integer` is computed first, and then the modulo operation with 256 is applied to that result.
5. Since `prev` is 0, the expression simplifies to `-integer % 256`.

Assuming `integer` is calculated from the ASCII value of the first character in `input`, we denote the following:

- The value of `integer`, which depends on the ASCII value of `c`. For any character `c`, the integer representation will vary, but let's denote this value as `X` for clarity.

The output state will therefore depend on the specific value of `X` (the ASCII integer representation of `c`), but the calculation would yield `(-X) % 256`. 

Thus, the output state can be expressed generically as:

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, `binary` is the reversed value of `s`, `integer` is `X`, and the result is `(-X) % 256`.**
