To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The code snippet `print(prev - integer) % 256` computes the expression `prev - integer` and then takes the result modulo 256.
2. The variables affected by this computation are `prev` and `integer`.
3. The value of `prev` is known as a new integer value, and `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary string representation of the ASCII value of the third character of `input`.

Since the exact values of `prev` and `integer` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot compute a specific numeric result; however, we can describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `prev` is the new integer value, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, `binary` is the reversed string of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`, and the result of `prev - integer % 256` is printed.
