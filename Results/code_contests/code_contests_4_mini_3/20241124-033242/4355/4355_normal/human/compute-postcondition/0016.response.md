The value of `s` is assigned the formatted string that represents the binary representation of the ASCII value of `c`, which is the third character of `input`. The `ord(c)` function returns the ASCII value of `c`, `bin(...)` converts that to a binary string, and then the `format(...)` ensures that it is padded to 8 characters with leading zeros if necessary. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the output state reflects the new value of `s` based on the ASCII value of the character `c`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}; `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `prev` is the new integer value; `c` is the third character of `input`; `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`**
