The value of `s` is an 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`. The code `binary = s[::-1]` reverses the string `s`. The output state will reflect the unchanged values of other variables and the new value of `binary`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, and `binary` is the reversed value of `s`.**
