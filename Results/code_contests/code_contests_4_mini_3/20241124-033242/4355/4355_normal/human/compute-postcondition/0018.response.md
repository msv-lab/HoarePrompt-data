The variable `binary` is a reversed string of `s`, which is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`. The `int` function converts `binary` from a binary string to an integer. The previous state of the variables does not change except for the new variable `integer`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the previous variables and the new integer value derived from `binary`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `prev` is the new integer value, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`, `binary` is the reversed string of `s`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary`.**
