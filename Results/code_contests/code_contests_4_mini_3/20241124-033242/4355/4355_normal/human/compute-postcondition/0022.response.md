Output State: **`input` is a non-empty string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `prev` is the integer value of the last processed character's reversed binary representation; `c` is the last character of `input`; `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of the ASCII value of `c`; `binary` is the reversed value of `s`; `integer` is the integer value of `binary`; if `input` is empty, the loop does not execute and `prev` remains 0.**
