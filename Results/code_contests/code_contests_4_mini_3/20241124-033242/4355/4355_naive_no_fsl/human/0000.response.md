Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description due to a critical mistake in the handling of the output for each character. Specifically, the line where it attempts to print the result of the calculation:

```python
print(prev - integer) % 256
```

This line mistakenly places the modulo operation after the `print` function, which means the result is not being computed correctly. Instead, it should be:

```python
print((prev - integer) % 256)
```

This error will cause incorrect outputs, particularly for the first character where `prev` is initially 0. The expected output for the first character should be `(0 - integer) % 256`, but due to the syntax error, it might produce an incorrect value.

For example, if the input is "H" (ASCII 72), the program will fail to produce the correct output for the first element of the array because the calculation is not being performed properly. Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements as described in the problem, demonstrating that it is indeed incorrect.
