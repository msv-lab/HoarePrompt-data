The code assigns the value of `s` using the `format` method, where `c` is a character from `text`. The `ord(c)` function gets the Unicode code point of the character `c`, and `bin()` converts that code point to a binary string. The `format` method then formats this binary string to be 8 characters long, padding it with leading zeros if necessary. 

Since the initial state includes that `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, we know `c` will be a character from this string, and the output will depend on the specific character `c` being processed. However, we cannot determine a specific output for `s` without knowing the exact character `c`.

Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, and `s` is the formatted binary string representation of the Unicode code point of character `c` padded to 8 bits.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, and `s` is the formatted binary string representation of the Unicode code point of character `c` padded to 8 bits.**
