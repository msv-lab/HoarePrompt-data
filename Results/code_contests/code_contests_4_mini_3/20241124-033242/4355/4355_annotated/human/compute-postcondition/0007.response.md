The expression `print(prev - integer) % 256` calculates the difference between `prev` and `integer`, and then takes the result modulo 256. The values of `prev` and `integer` are unaffected by this operation, but the result of the calculation will be printed. 

Given the initial state:
- `prev` is 0
- `integer` is the integer value of `binary`

The calculation will result in `(0 - integer) % 256`. 

Output State: **`prev` is 0, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`, and the result of the calculation is printed as (0 - integer) % 256**.
