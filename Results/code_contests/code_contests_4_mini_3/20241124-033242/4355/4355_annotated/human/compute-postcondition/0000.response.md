The variable `table` is assigned a dictionary containing specific character mappings to their corresponding integer values. The initial state of the variable `text` is not affected, and no calculations or changes are made to it based on the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `text` along with the newly defined `table`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character's ASCII code is between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}**
