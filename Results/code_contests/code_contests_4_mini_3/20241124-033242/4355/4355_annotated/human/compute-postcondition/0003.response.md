According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input` string. The loop will iterate over each character in the `input` string. For the loop to execute at least once, `input` must contain at least one character. Given that the state specifies `input` is a string read from standard input without trailing whitespace, it is implied that `input` could be empty if no input was provided.

In the provided state, `prev` is 0, which is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but may be used within the loop body. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to guarantee that `input` contains at least one character. Since `text` is a string with between 1 and 100 characters, it does not impact the execution of the loop directly.

To summarize, we need to adjust the state to clarify that `input` contains at least one character for the loop to execute.

State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, and `prev` is 0**
