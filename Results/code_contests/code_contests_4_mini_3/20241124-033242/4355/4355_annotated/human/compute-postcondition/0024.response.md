Functionality: ** The function reads a line of input from standard input, processes each character by converting it to its binary representation, and calculates the difference between the previous character's integer value (in binary) and the current character's integer value, wrapping the result within the range of 0 to 255. If the input is empty, no calculations occur, and the result remains unspecified. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs the calculated differences. **
