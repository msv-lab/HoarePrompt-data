The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`. The previous value of `prev` is an integer, but the specific value is not given. The state of `integer` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prev` is now the same as `integer`, and `integer` is still an integer value.

Output State: **`prev` is now the same as `integer`, and `integer` is still an integer value**
