The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`, and `prev` was previously 0. Therefore, after execution, `prev` will have the value of `integer`. The state of the other variable, `integer`, remains unchanged. The result of the calculation (0 - integer) % 256 is not directly affected by the assignment statement itself and is not printed or returned in this context. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `prev`.

Output State: **`prev` is `integer`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`**
