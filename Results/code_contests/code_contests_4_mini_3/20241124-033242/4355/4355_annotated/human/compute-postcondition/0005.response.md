The variable `binary` is assigned the value of `s` reversed. The variable `s` is the formatted binary string representation of the Unicode code point of character `c`, which is padded to 8 bits. Therefore, the value of `binary` will be the reverse of that 8-bit binary string. The states of the other variables (`text`, `table`, `input`, `prev`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, `s` is the formatted binary string representation of the Unicode code point of character `c` padded to 8 bits, and `binary` is the reverse of `s`.**
