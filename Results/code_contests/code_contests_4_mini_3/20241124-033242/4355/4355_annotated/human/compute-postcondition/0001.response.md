The variable `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, which reads a line from standard input and removes any trailing whitespace (including the newline character). The state of `text` is not directly altered by this operation, but `input` will now contain the string read from input without trailing whitespace. The variable `table` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, and `input` is a string read from standard input without trailing whitespace.
