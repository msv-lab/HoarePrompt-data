The expression `print(prev - integer) % 256` computes the difference between `prev` and `integer`, then takes that result modulo 256. The values of `prev` and `integer` are integers, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The print statement outputs the result of the calculation.

Since no variables other than `prev` and `integer` are affected, the output state reflects the calculations made.

Output State: **`prev` is integer, `integer` is the integer value of the binary representation, and the result of (prev - integer) % 256 is printed.**
