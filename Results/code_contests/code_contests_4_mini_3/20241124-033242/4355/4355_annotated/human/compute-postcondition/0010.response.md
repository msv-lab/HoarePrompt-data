The code assigns a formatted string to `s`. The format string `'{0:0>{1}}'` is used to create a binary representation of the character `c`, which is obtained by `ord(c)`, and then converting it to binary using `bin()`. The `[2:]` slices the result to remove the '0b' prefix. The second part of the format specifies that the total length of the output should be padded to 8 characters with leading zeros if necessary.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `c` is the next character in the input.
- `ord(c)` converts the character `c` to its integer ASCII value.
- `bin(ord(c))[2:]` generates the binary representation of that ASCII value, and its length can vary depending on the character.
- The total output length is specified as 8.

Thus, `s` will contain the 8-bit binary representation of the ASCII value of `c`.

Output State: **`prev` is `integer`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`, `input` has at least one more character, `c` is the next character in the input, and `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the ASCII value of `c`.**
