To calculate the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

From the initial state, we have:
- `W` is an integer between 1 and 100000.
- `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000.
- `c` is an input integer.
- `b` is assigned the value `a + W`.
- `d` is assigned the value `c + W`.
- `b` is less than `c`.

Now, we execute the code snippet:
```
ans = c - b
```

The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `c - b`. Since `b` is defined as `a + W`, we have:
- `ans = c - (a + W)`

The conditions indicate that `b < c`, which suggests that `c` must be greater than `b` and consequently, `ans` will be a positive integer.

Since `W`, `a`, and `c` are not specified but fall within the defined ranges, the output state reflects that `ans` is calculated as `c - (a + W)`.

Output State: **`W` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `c` is an input integer; `b` is assigned the value `a + W`; `d` is assigned the value `c + W`; `b` is less than `c`; `ans` is calculated as `c - (a + W)`**
