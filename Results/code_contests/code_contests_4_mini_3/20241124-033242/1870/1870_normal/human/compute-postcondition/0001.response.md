The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`. The values of `a` and `W` are both integers within the range of 1 to 100000, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, `b` will also be an integer within the range of 2 to 200000. The state of `c` remains unchanged, as it is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `W` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `c` is an integer assigned from input, and `b` is assigned the value `a + W`.

Output State: **`W` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `c` is an integer assigned from input, and `b` is assigned the value `a + W`.**
