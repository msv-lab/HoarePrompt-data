Functionality: ** The function reads three integers W, a, and c from input, computes b as a + W and d as c + W, and determines the value of ans based on the comparisons between b and c, and d and a. It calculates ans as the difference between c and b if b is less than c, or as the difference between a and d if d is less than a; otherwise, it sets ans to 0. The function does not return any value but prints the result of ans. It does not explicitly handle cases where input values might result in unexpected behavior, such as negative results or conditions where W, a, or c do not meet expected ranges. **
