The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters; however, it operates based on the constraints provided for three integers: `W`, `a`, and `b`. The output of the function is determined by these integers. Since there are no specific output cases provided, we cannot detail different return values based on conditions. Therefore, we can only conclude that the function's behavior is dependent on the values of `W`, `a`, and `b`, which are integers within the specified ranges. 

Functionality: **The function operates using the integers W, a, and b, which must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 100000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100000, but does not explicitly return any values or accept parameters.**
