`d` is assigned the value `c + W`. The variable `W` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `c` is also an integer assigned from input, so the value of `d` will depend on the specific values of `c` and `W`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `W` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `c` is an input integer; `b` is assigned the value `a + W`; `d` is assigned the value `c + W`.

Output State: **`W` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `c` is an input integer; `b` is assigned the value `a + W`; `d` is assigned the value `c + W`.**
