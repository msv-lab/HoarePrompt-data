To provide the output state, we need to analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `W` is an integer between 1 and 100000.
   - `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `b` is assigned the value `a + W`.
   - `d` is assigned the value `c + W`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` is less than `c`: `ans` is calculated as `c - (a + W)`.
   - If `d` (which is `c + W`) is less than `a`: `ans` is equal to `a - (c + W)`.
   - Otherwise, if `d` is greater than or equal to `a`: `ans` is 0.

3. **Calculation**: 
   - Since we do not know the specific values of `W`, `a`, and `c`, we can't compute a specific numeric value for `ans`.
   - However, we can represent the possible outcomes based on the conditions provided.

Therefore, the output state will reflect all the variables and the calculation of `ans` based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`W` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `c` is an input integer; `b` is `a + W`; `d` is `c + W`; `ans` is calculated based on the conditions provided.**
