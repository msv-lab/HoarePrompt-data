Postcondition: ***`W` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `c` is an input integer; `b` is assigned the value `a + W`; `d` is assigned the value `c + W`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `ans` is calculated as `c - (a + W)`. If `d` (which is `c + W`) is less than `a`, then `ans` is equal to `a - (c + W)`. Otherwise, if `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 0. This accounts for all cases where `b` is either less than, equal to, or greater than `c`, and where `d` can be less than, equal to, or greater than `a`.***
