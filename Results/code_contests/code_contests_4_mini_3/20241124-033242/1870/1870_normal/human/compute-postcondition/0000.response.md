The values of `W`, `a`, and `b` are assigned from the input provided by `raw_input()`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts the input values into integers, and they are assigned to `W`, `a`, and `c`. The initial values of `W`, `a`, and `b` are not changed by this operation, but the specific values of `a` and `c` will be set based on the input. Since `b` is not mentioned in the input, its value remains undefined in this context.

Output State: **`W` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `c` is an integer assigned from input, and `b` is undefined**
