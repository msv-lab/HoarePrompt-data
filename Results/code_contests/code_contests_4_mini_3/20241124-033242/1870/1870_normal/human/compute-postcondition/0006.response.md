Postcondition: ***`W` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `a` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `c` is an input integer; `b` is assigned the value `a + W`; `d` is assigned the value `c + W`; the value of `b` is greater than or equal to `c` (i.e., `a + W >= c`); and `d` is less than `a` (i.e., `c + W < a`).***
