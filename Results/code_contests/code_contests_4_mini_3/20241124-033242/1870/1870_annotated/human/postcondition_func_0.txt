The function reads three integers from input: W (a positive integer between 1 and 100,000), a (an integer between 1 and 100,000), and c (an integer). It computes two intermediate values, b (which is a + W) and d (which is c + W). The function then evaluates the relationship between b, c, a, and d to determine the value of ans: if b is less than c, it sets ans to c - b; if not, and if d is less than a, it sets ans to a - d; otherwise, ans is set to 0. Finally, it prints the value of ans. The function does not return any value.
