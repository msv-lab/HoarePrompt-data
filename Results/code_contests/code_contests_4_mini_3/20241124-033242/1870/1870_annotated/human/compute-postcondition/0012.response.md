Output State: **`W` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input`, `b` is equal to `a + W`, `d` is equal to `c + W`, and `ans` is determined based on the conditions involving `b`, `c`, `d`, and `a`. The value of `ans` is printed.**
