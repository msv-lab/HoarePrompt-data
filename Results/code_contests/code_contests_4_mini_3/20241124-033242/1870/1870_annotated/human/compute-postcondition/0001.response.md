The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`. The values of `a` and `W` are both positive integers within the range specified (1 to 100000). Therefore, the new value of `b` will be the sum of the current values of `a` and `W`. The variable `c` is not affected by this operation, and `b` is updated. 

Output State: **`W` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is assigned the value from `raw_input`, `b` is updated to `a + W`**
