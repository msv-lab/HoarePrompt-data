The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since the parameter list is empty. However, it operates based on the constraints provided: `W` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000, and both `a` and `b` are integers within the range 1 to 100,000. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, I cannot determine the exact return value without more details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on constraints where W is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 100,000) and a and b are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100,000). The specific return value is not provided.**
