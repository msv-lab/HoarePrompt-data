Postcondition: ***`W` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input`, `b` is equal to `a + W`, and `d` is equal to `c + W`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `c - b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `a - d`. If both conditions are not met, `ans` is assigned the value of 0. This ensures all possible relationships between `b`, `c`, `d`, and `a` are covered.***
