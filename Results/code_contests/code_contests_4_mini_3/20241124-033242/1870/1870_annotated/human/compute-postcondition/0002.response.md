The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`. The value of `c` is derived from `raw_input`, and `W` is a positive integer within the specified range. Since `W` is known to be a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `d` will be determined by the sum of this value and whatever input was provided for `c`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `W` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input`, `b` is updated to `a + W`, and `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`.

Output State: **`W` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input`, `b` is updated to `a + W`, and `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`.**
