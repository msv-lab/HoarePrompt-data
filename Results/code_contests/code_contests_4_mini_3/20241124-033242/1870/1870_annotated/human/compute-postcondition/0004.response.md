To evaluate the code snippet, we first identify the variables and their relationships based on the initial state provided.

- `W` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq W \leq 100000\).
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100000\).
- `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input`, which is a string input.
- `b` is an integer equal to \(a + W\).
- `d` is an integer equal to \(c + W\).
- It is established that \(b < c\).

Given the line of code:
```
ans = c - b
```
We can analyze the impact:

1. The variable `b` is calculated as \(b = a + W\).
2. The variable `c` is derived from user input and is a string which needs to be converted to an integer for the subtraction operation.
3. The code assigns the result of \(c - b\) to `ans`.

Since we have the condition \(b < c\), we can conclude that the subtraction \(c - b\) will yield a positive result.

However, since `c` is derived from user input, we cannot determine its specific value, but we know it is greater than `b`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `ans` is assigned the result of the subtraction of `b` from `c`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`W` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is a value from `raw_input`, `b` is equal to `a + W`, `d` is equal to `c + W`, `b` is less than `c`, and `ans` is assigned the value of `c - b`.**
