Postcondition: ***`W` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input`, `b` is updated to `a + W`, `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is equal to `a - d`. Otherwise, if `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 0. This handles the cases where `d` can be less than, equal to, or greater than `a`, ensuring all edge cases regarding the relationships between `a`, `c`, and `d` are covered.***
