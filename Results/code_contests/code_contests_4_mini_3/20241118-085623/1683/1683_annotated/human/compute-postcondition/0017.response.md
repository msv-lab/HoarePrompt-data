To determine the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current conditions based on the provided information.

1. The variable `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, which indicates the length of the list `a`.
2. The list `a` contains `n` integers in reverse order.
3. The second element of the list `a` is denoted as `ai`, corresponding to `a[1]` (considering zero-based indexing).
4. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

Based on the task requirements:
- If `ai` (the second element, `a[1]`) is already in `vis`, the loop will continue to the next iteration without changing `ans` or `vis`.
- If `ai` is not in `vis`, it will be appended to `ans`, and `vis` will be updated to include `ai`.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration describes a scenario where `ai` may or may not be in `vis`, the critical aspect to consider is the current value of `ai` and its presence in `vis`.

Given that the loop processes each element of `a`, and since `a` has `n` elements, if we are at the second element (`a[1]`), the next iteration will involve processing the third element (`a[2]`), which will be the next `ai` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- The index for `ai` must be updated to reflect the next element in the loop.
- The states of `ans` and `vis` may or may not change, depending on whether `a[1]` was already in `vis` or not.

However, since the task does not require us to assume changes to `ans` or `vis` for the next iteration but only to update the states based on the next iteration, we conclude that the relevant updates are:

- `ai` should now represent the third element of `a` (`a[2]`).
- The index for the next iteration is now 2.

Thus, the adjusted state to reflect the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` contains the unique elements processed so far, and `ans` contains the unique elements from `a` processed so far.**
