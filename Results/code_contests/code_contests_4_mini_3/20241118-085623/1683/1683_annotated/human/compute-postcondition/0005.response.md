According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. Since `a` is defined to contain `n` integers where `n` is a positive integer, it will always have at least 1 integer (because `n` is at least 1). Therefore, the loop will execute with `ai` taking the values from the list `a`. 

Since `a` is a list of integers in reverse order, we can also note that at the start of the loop, `ai` will be the first element of the list `a`, which is the last integer in the original order.

Thus, the necessary states before the loop execution are:
- `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50,
- `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order,
- `ans` is an empty list,
- `vis` is an empty set,
- `ai` is the first element of the list `a` (which is the last integer in the original order).

State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is an empty set, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`**.
