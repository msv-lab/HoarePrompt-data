The code adds the element `ai` to the set `vis`. The variable `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, and it is already included in the list of unique elements processed so far. The initial state remains unchanged except for the `vis` set, which now contains `ai` as a new unique element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` now includes `ai`, and `ans` includes `ai`.**
