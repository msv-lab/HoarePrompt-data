Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order. If `ai` (the second element of `a`) is already in `vis`, the iteration continues without any changes to `ans` or `vis`. If `ai` is not in `vis`, it is appended to `ans`, and `vis` is updated to include `ai`. Thus, `ans` contains the first element of `a` and potentially `ai`, while `vis` contains the first element of `a` and possibly `ai` as well. Overall, `ans` holds unique elements from `a` processed so far, and `vis` keeps track of those unique elements encountered.***
