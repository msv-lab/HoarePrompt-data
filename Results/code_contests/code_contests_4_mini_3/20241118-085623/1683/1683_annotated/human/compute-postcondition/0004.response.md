The variable `vis` is assigned a new empty set. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ans` is an empty list, and `vis` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order; `ans` is an empty list; `vis` is an empty set**
