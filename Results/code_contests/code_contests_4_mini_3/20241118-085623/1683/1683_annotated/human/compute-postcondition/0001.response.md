The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers by reading a line of input, stripping any whitespace, and then splitting that line into separate string elements which are then converted to integers using `map`. The previous state of `n` is not directly affected, but it determines how many integers will be included in the list `a`. The integers in `a` must satisfy the conditions given in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000**
