The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. The variable `ai` holds the value of the third element from the list `a`, which contains `n` integers in reverse order. The state of `ans` will change to include this new element, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` contains the unique elements processed so far, and `ans` now includes `ai`**.
