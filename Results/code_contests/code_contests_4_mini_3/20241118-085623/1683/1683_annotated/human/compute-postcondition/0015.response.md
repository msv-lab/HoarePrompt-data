The variable `vis` is a set that will have the value `ai` added to it. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `vis` contains the first element of `a`, and `ai` is a variable that is being appended to `ans`. After executing the code, `ai` will be added to the set `vis`, which will then include its previous elements plus `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ans` includes the first element of `a` and `ai` has been appended to `ans`, `vis` now includes the first element of `a` and `ai`.**
