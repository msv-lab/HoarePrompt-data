The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop we are in. Therefore, the output state reflects that there has been no change to the variables, but we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ans` includes the first element of `a`, `vis` contains the first element of `a`, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
