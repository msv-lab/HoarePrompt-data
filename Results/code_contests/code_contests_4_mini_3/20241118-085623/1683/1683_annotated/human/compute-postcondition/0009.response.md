The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. The value of `ai` is the first element of the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` integers in reverse order, `ai` is equal to `a[n-1]` (the last element in the original order). The state of the other variables does not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ans` contains the first element of `a`, `vis` does not contain the first element of the list `a`, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ans` contains the first element of `a`, `vis` does not contain the first element of the list `a`, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`**
