Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, and `ai` is the third element of `a`. If `ai` is already in the set `vis`, the current iteration is skipped, leaving `vis` and `ans` unchanged. If `ai` is not in `vis`, it is added to both `vis` and `ans`, ensuring that `ans` contains only unique elements from `a` processed so far.***
