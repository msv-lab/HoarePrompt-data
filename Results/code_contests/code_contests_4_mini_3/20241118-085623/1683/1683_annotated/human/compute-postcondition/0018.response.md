The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop in which it is executed. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` contains the unique elements processed so far, and `ans` contains the unique elements from `a` processed so far, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
