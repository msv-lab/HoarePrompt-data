Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order. If `ai` is already in the set `vis`, we skip to the next iteration. Otherwise, `ans` includes the first element of `a`, and `vis` now contains `ai`. This ensures that `ans` holds unique elements from the list `a` while `vis` tracks the seen elements.***
