The list `a` is reversed with the operation `a = a[::-1]`. The original order of the elements in `a` is changed to the reverse order, but the values themselves remain within the specified range (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000). The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `a` as its elements are reversed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order**
