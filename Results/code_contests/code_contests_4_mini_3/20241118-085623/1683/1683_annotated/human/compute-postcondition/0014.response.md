The variable `ai` is assigned the second element of the list `a`, and `ans.append(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the end of the list `ans`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list with `n` integers in reverse order, so `ai` is the second element of `a` (which is the second last element in the original order). The value of `ans` will now include the original first element of `a` plus the value of `ai`.

Since the output state does not specify the specific values for `a`, `ans`, and `vis`, we conclude that:
- `ans` was initially equal to the first element of `a`.
- `vis` was also equal to the first element of `a`.
- `ai` is now added to `ans`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ans` includes the first element of `a` and `ai` has been appended to `ans`, `vis` contains the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `ans` includes the first element of `a` and `ai` has been appended to `ans`, `vis` contains the first element of `a`.**
