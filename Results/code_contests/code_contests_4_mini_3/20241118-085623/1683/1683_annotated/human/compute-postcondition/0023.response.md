Output State: **`ans` contains unique integers from the list `a` in reverse order of their first appearance, `vis` contains all unique integers seen during the loop execution. If `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `ans` and `vis` remain empty. If all elements of `a` are the same, `ans` will contain that single element, and `vis` will contain that element as well. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once.**
