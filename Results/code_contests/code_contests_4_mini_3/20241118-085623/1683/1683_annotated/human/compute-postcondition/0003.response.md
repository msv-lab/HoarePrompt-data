The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. The previous values of `n` and `a` do not change; they remain a positive integer and a list of integers in reverse order, respectively. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged initial values along with the new empty list `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order; `ans` is an empty list**
