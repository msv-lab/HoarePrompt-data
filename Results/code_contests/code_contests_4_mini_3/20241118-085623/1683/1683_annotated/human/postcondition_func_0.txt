The function reads an integer `n` and then reads a list of `n` integers. It collects the unique integers from this list in reverse order of their first appearance and prints the number of unique integers followed by these integers in their original order. If `n` is 0 or the list is empty, it will print 0 and not display any integers. The function does not handle invalid input cases (like non-integer values), which may lead to runtime errors.
