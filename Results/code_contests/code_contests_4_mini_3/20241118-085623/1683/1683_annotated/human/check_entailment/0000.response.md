To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The goal of the program is to remove duplicates from a list of integers while keeping only the rightmost occurrence of each integer. The relative order of the remaining unique elements should not change.

### Code Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the array.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Reversing the Array**:
   - `a = a[::-1]` reverses the array. This is done so that when we traverse the array from start to finish, we can easily keep the rightmost occurrence of each element.

3. **Finding Unique Elements**:
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` and a set `vis` to keep track of seen elements.
   - The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the reversed array `a`.
   - If `ai` has not been seen (i.e., not in `vis`), it appends `ai` to `ans` and adds `ai` to the set `vis`.
   - If `ai` is already in `vis`, it skips adding it to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints the length of `ans`, which represents the number of unique elements.
   - It prints the elements in `ans` in the correct order (by reversing `ans` again).

### Testing Edge Cases:

- **Single Element Case**: 
  - For input `1\n5`, the output should be `1\n5`, which the code handles correctly.

- **All Duplicates**:
  - For input `5\n6 6 6 6 6`, the output should be `1\n6`. The code handles this case correctly.

- **Multiple Duplicates with Different Counts**:
  - For input `6\n1 5 5 1 6 1`, the expected output is `3\n5 6 1`. The code produces this output correctly.

- **Order Preservation**:
  - For input `5\n2 4 2 4 4`, the expected output is `2\n2 4`. The code handles this correctly as well.

### Conclusion:

After examining the code and testing various edge cases, the provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It successfully retains only the rightmost occurrences of each integer while preserving the relative order of the remaining unique elements.

Correctness: **True**
