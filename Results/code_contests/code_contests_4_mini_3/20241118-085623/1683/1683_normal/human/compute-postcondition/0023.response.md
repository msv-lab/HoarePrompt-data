Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the unique elements from `a` in the order they were first encountered, `vis` is a set containing all unique elements that have been processed from `a`. If `a` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and both `ans` and `vis` will remain empty. If `a` contains duplicate values, only the first occurrence of each value will be appended to `ans`.**
