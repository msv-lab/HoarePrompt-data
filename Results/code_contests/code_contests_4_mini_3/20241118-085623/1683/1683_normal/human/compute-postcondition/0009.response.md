The code `ans.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. The initial state indicates that `ai` is the first element in the list `a`. Since `ans` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `ans` will contain one element, which is the value of `ai`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 integer, `ans` contains the first element of `a`, `vis` is a set that does not contain the first element of `a`, `ai` is the first element in `a`**
