The variable `vis` is assigned an empty set using `set({})`. This operation does not affect the previously defined variables `n`, `a`, or `ans`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `vis` is now an empty set while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is the reversed list of integers created from input; `ans` is an empty list; `vis` is an empty set**
