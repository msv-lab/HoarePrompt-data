The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this context, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 integers, `ai` is the third element in `a`, and `vis` remains unchanged.**
