The code `ans.append(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. The value of `ai` is the second element in the list `a`, and since `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least one integer, `ai` has a specific value. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and notes that `ai` has been added to `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 integer, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `vis` remains unchanged, and `ai` has been appended to `ans`**.
