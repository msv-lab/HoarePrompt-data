Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 integer, `ai` is the second element in `a`, and `vis` remains unchanged. If `ai` is in `vis`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `ai` is not in `vis`, it is appended to `ans`, and `vis` is updated to include `ai`.***
