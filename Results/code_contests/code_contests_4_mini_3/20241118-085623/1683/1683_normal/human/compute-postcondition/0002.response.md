The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers created from input, its previous values are not specified, but they are within the bounds of 1 to 1000 for each element. The operation does not affect the variable `n`.

Therefore, the output state includes the original state of `n` and the reversed state of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is the reversed list of integers created from input**.
