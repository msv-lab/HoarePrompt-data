The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())`, where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line of input and `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `n` will thus be an integer that is read from input, and since it is specified that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, it will fall within this range. The variable `a` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000**
