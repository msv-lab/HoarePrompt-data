The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables or affect their states. It simply causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration, if applicable. Since no information about the loop context is provided, the output state retains the values of the variables as they were.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 integer, `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is a set that contains the element `ai`, and `ai` is the first element in `a`**.
