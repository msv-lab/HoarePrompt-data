The code adds `ai` to the set `vis`. Since `ai` is the first element of the list `a` and `vis` does not already contain `ai`, it will now include this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 integer, `ans` contains the first element of `a`, `vis` now contains the first element of `a`, `ai` is the first element in `a`**
