Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 integer, `ai` is the first element in `a`. If `ai` is already in `vis`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `ai` is appended to `ans` and added to `vis`. The state of `ans` reflects whether `ai` was previously encountered, and `vis` contains all unique elements that have been processed including `ai` if it was not in `vis` before.***
