The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The parameter `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` in the list must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. After executing the function body, the output will depend on the logic defined within the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, ensuring that `n` falls within the specified range and that each element in the list `a` meets its own specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each integer a_i in the list).**
