Upon reviewing the problem description, the program's code, and the output hints, we can analyze the behavior of the program.

The problem requires removing duplicate elements from an array while keeping only the rightmost occurrence of each element, and the relative order of the unique elements should remain unchanged. 

The provided program works as follows:

1. It reads an integer `n` for the number of elements.
2. It reads the array `a` and reverses it.
3. It iterates through the reversed array, adding elements to the `ans` list only if they haven't been seen before (using a set `vis` to track seen elements).
4. Finally, it prints the length of the `ans` list and the list itself in the original order.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Single Element Case**: If `n = 1`, the program should return that single element as the unique entry.
2. **All Unique Elements**: If all elements are unique, the program should return the same list.
3. **All Duplicates**: If all elements are the same, it should return 1 and that element.
4. **Empty Input**: While the problem states `1 â‰¤ n`, if it were to allow `n = 0`, the program should handle it gracefully.
5. **Maximum Input Values**: The program should handle the maximum constraints smoothly without performance issues.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function extracts unique elements in the order they were first encountered (after reversing the list). It also mentions that if the list is empty, it will print 0 and nothing else.

However, since the problem constraints specify that `n` will always be at least 1, the empty input case is not directly relevant.

### Conclusion
Upon careful examination, the program appears to follow the problem description correctly. It successfully handles the requirement to keep only the rightmost occurrence of each element and prints the results in the correct order. The output hints also align with the code's functionality.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly processes the input to maintain the rightmost occurrences of elements and prints them in the original order, thus fulfilling the problem's requirements for all valid input cases.
