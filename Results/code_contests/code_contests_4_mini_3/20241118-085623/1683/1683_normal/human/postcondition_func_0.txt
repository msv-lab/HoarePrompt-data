The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, reads them from standard input, and extracts the unique elements from `a` in the order they were first encountered (after reversing the list). It then prints the count of these unique elements and the unique elements themselves in their original order. If the list `a` is empty, it will print 0 and nothing else.
