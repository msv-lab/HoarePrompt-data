To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it handles all specified requirements correctly.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to remove duplicates from an array while keeping the rightmost occurrence of each element.
2. The order of the remaining elements should reflect their last occurrence in the original array.
3. We need to output the count of unique elements followed by the unique elements themselves.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided does the following:
1. Reads an integer `n` which specifies the number of elements in the array.
2. Reads the array `a` of integers.
3. Reverses the array `a` to facilitate the collection of unique elements from the end.
4. Initializes an empty list `ans` and a set `vis` to keep track of seen elements.
5. Iterates through the reversed array:
   - If the current element has not been seen (not in `vis`), it appends it to `ans` and adds it to `vis`.
6. Finally, it prints the length of `ans` (the count of unique elements) and the unique elements in the order they were last seen (by reversing `ans` again).

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles arrays with all duplicates since it will leave one occurrence at the end and output the correct count and value.
- It also works for single-element arrays, as that single element will be returned.
- It handles arrays with multiple unique values correctly as well.

However, let’s consider a case where the input has alternating duplicates:
- **Test Case:**
  Input:
  ```
  8
  1 2 1 3 2 4 5 4
  ```
  Expected Output:
  ```
  5
  1 3 2 5 4
  ```
  
  The program will reverse the array to:
  ```
  4 5 2 3 1 2 1
  ```
  It will then build the answer list `ans` in the following manner:
  
  - `4` → added to `ans`
  - `5` → added to `ans`
  - `2` → added to `ans`
  - `3` → added to `ans`
  - `1` → added to `ans`
  
  The final `ans` before reversal will be `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, and after reversal yields `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]`, which is incorrect since the order of last occurrences needs to be preserved.

### Conclusion:
The program does not maintain the order of the rightmost occurrences correctly in all cases. In the above example, the expected order (1, 3, 2, 5, 4) is not achieved.

Thus, the program fails for at least this case.

Correctness: **False**.
