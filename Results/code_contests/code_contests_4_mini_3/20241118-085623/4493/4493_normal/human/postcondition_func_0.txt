The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It counts how many integers in `arr` satisfy the condition that each integer plus `k` is less than or equal to 5, divides this count by 3, and prints the result. If `n` is 0, the output will be 0. If the input is malformed (e.g., if `arr` has fewer than `n` elements), an IndexError may occur.
