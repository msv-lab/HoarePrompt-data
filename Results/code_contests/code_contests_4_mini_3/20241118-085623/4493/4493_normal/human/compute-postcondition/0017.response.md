The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. 

- `n` is an integer constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000.
- `k` is an integer constrained such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `yi` satisfies the constraint 0 ≤ yi ≤ 5.

The function does not have specific cases provided in the output description. Therefore, the exact return value is not defined in the provided information. However, based on the parameter constraints, we can summarize the functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each integer in `arr` is between 0 and 5 inclusive.**
