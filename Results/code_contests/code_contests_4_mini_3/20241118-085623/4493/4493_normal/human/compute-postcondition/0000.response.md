The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from `raw_input()`, which reads a line of input. The input is split into two parts, and `n` and `k` will hold the respective values as strings. Since `n` and `k` are integers, they will need to be converted to integers after this operation. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `k` is an input string, and they will be converted to integers later.**
