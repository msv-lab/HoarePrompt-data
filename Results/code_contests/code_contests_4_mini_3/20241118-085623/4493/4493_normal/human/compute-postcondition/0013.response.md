Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a map object of integers, and `count` is 2.0 initially. If `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is incremented by 1.0, resulting in `count` being 3.0; otherwise, `count` remains 2.0. Additionally, `i` is updated to `i + 1` in both cases.***
