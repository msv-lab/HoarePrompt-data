Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, and `arr` is a map object of integers. If `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5, `count` is increased by 1.0, resulting in `count` being 2.0, and `i` is updated to its next value. If `arr[i] + k` is greater than 5, `count` remains at 1.0, and `i` is also updated to its next value.***
