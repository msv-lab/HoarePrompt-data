The variable `arr` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes an input line, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and creates an iterable map object. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `arr` is a map object of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `arr` is a map object of integers from the input**
