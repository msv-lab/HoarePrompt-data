The value of `count` is incremented by `1.0`, resulting in `count` becoming `3.0`. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a map object of integers, `count` is 3.0, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a map object of integers, `count` is 3.0, `i` is updated to `i + 1**
