The variable `count` is initialized to `0.0`, but this does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `arr`. The values of these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a map object of integers from the input, and `count` is initialized to 0.0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a map object of integers from the input, and `count` is initialized to 0.0**
