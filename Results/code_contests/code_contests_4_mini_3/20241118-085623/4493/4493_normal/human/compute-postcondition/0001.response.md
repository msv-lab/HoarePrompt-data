The values of `n` and `k` are both input strings, and they will be converted to integers using `int()`. After this line executes, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values of the input strings. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified, so we cannot determine their exact integer values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
