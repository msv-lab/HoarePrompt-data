According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, indicating that there are still iterations to be made. 

Since `i` is updated to its next value at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, if `i` was incremented during the last iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the next value.

Assuming that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to its next value (which is the previous value of `i` + 1).
- Since `n` is greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

Thus, the updated states would reflect that `i` is now one value higher than it was at the end of the last iteration, ensuring it is still less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a map object of integers, `count` is 2.0, `i` is updated to `i + 1`**
