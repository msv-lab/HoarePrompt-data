`count` is incremented by 1.0. The previous value of `count` is 1.0, so after execution, `count` becomes 2.0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers from user input, `count` is 2.0, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers from user input, `count` is 2.0, `i` is 1**
