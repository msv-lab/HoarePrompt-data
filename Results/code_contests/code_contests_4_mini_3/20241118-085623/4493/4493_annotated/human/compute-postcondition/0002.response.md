The code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `arr`. The `raw_input()` function accepts a space-separated string of numbers from the user, `split()` divides this string into individual string components, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string component into an integer. The initial state of `n`, `k`, and `arr` is affected by the new assignment to `arr`. Since the specifics of `n` and `k` are not altered by this operation, they remain unchanged. The output state indicates the original values of `n` and `k`, while `arr` is now a list of integers derived from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from user input**
