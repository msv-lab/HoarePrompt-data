Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers from user input, `count` is 1.0 initially and is incremented by 1.0 if the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5; thus, if `arr[i] + k <= 5`, then `count` becomes 2.0. If this condition is not met, `count` remains 1.0.***
