Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers from user input, `count` is 0.0 initially, and `i` is 0. If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is increased by 1.0, resulting in `count` being 1.0. If `arr[i] + k` is greater than 5, `count` remains 0.0.***
