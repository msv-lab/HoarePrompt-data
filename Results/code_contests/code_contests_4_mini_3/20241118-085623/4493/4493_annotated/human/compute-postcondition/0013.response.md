Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `k` is an integer, and `arr` is a list of integers. If `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is increased by 1.0, resulting in `count` being either `2.0` or `3.0`. If `arr[i] + k` is greater than 5, `count` remains unchanged at 1.0 or 2.0, depending on its initial value.***
