After executing the code, `n` and `k` are converted from their original string values to integers using `int()`. The values of `arr` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to `n` and `k` as they are now integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 5**
