The variable `count` is assigned the value `0.0`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers from user input, and `count` is 0.0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers from user input, and `count` is 0.0**
