The code snippet assigns values to `n` and `k` by reading input from the user, splitting it into two parts. The input values will be interpreted as strings. The values of `n` and `k` will be assigned based on the user's input, while the state of `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k`, but since they are determined by user input, we will denote them as input strings.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `k` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 5**
