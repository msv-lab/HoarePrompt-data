The value of `count` is incremented by `1.0`. Since `count` can either be `1.0` or `2.0` depending on the condition `arr[i] + k <= 5`, the new value of `count` will be either `2.0` or `3.0`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, and `count` is either `2.0` or `3.0`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, and `count` is either `2.0` or `3.0**
