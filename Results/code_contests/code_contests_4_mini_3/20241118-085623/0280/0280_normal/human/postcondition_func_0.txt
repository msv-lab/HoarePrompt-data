The function accepts a positive integer `n` and an integer `p`, and it returns the result of `n` raised to the power of `(p - 2)` modulo `p`. The function essentially computes the modular exponentiation, which is often used in mathematical computations involving large numbers and is particularly relevant in fields like cryptography. There are no checks for cases where `p` is less than or equal to 2, which may lead to unexpected results or errors, particularly when `p` is 1 or negative.
