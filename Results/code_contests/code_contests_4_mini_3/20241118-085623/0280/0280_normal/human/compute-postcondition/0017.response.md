The variable `i` is assigned the value of `p * p + p`, and `prime[i]` is set to `False`. Since `i` is defined as `p * p + p`, and `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= (p + 1)^2`, the value of `i` will be valid within the range allowed by `n`. The state of the variable `prime` at index `i` is updated to `False`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= (p + 1)^2; i` is `p * p + p; prime[i]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= (p + 1)^2; `i` is `p * p + p; `prime[i]` is set to `False`**
