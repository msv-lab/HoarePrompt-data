The function `func_8` accepts a positive integer parameter `n` and generates a list of all prime numbers less than `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The function initializes a list `prime` with boolean values indicating whether each number up to `n` is prime. It then iterates through potential prime numbers and marks their multiples as not prime. After processing, it constructs a list `f` containing all numbers that are still marked as prime. 

However, the edge cases are important to note: if `n` is less than 2, the function will return an empty list, as there are no prime numbers less than 2. If `n` is exactly 2, the function will return `[2]`, and if `n` is 3, it will return `[2, 3]`. For any value of `n` greater than 3, it will return all prime numbers less than `n`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of all prime numbers less than `n`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns an empty list. If `n` is 2, it returns `[2]`, and if `n` is 3, it returns `[2, 3]`. For values of `n` greater than 3, it returns all prime numbers less than `n`. **
