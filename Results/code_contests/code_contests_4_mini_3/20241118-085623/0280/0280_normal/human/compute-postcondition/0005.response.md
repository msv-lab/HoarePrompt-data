According to the code, the loop will execute again if the starting value of `i` (which is `p * p` or 4 in this case) is less than or equal to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, which means `n + 1` is at least 4. 

Currently, `i` is set to 4, and the loop increments `i` by `p` (which is 2) on each iteration. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 6 (i.e., `i = 4 + 2`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must remain less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n + 1` is greater than or equal to 4. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to consider that `i` will become 6 after the next iteration, so we need to adjust `n` accordingly to ensure the loop can run with `i` being 6.

Thus, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 6 or more to allow the loop to execute one more time. This means `n + 1` must be at least 6.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `p` is 2, `i` is 6, `prime` is a list with `n + 1` elements, with the element at index 4 set to `False`**
