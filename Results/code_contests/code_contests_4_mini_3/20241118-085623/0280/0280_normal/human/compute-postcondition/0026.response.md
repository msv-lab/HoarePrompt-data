The code assigns `False` to the element at index `i` in the list `prime`. The value of `i` is calculated as `p * p`, and since `n` is greater than `(p + 1)^2`, it follows that `i` must be less than `n`. The state of `n` does not change, and only the value at index `i` in the `prime` list is affected. Therefore, the output state reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than (p + 1)^2; `i` is p * p; `prime[i]` is set to False**
