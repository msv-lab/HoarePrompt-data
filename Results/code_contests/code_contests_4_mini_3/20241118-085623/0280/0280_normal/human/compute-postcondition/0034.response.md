The value of `p` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p` is unknown. The state of the `prime` array remains unchanged because the code snippet only modifies `p`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `p` has been increased by 1 while the `prime` array remains as is. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than (p + 1)^2; `p` is increased by 1; the `prime` array remains unchanged**.
