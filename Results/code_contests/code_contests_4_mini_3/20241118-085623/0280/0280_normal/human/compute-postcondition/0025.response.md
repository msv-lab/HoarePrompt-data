According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `p`, and `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `p * p`, and it will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than `(p + 1)^2`, it ensures that `n` is sufficiently large for the loop to execute at least once. 

For the loop to begin executing:
- `i` should start at `p * p`.
- Since `n` is greater than `(p + 1)^2`, it follows that `n` is also greater than `p * p`. Therefore, we can conclude that `i` will be less than or equal to `n` when the loop starts.

Thus, the necessary states before the loop starts are:
- `n` is greater than `(p + 1)^2`
- `i` is `p * p`

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than (p + 1)^2, `i` is p * p**
