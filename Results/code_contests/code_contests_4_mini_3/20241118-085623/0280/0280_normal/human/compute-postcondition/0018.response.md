According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` equal to `p * p + p` and `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= (p + 1)^2`. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` and ensure it is still within the bounds defined by `n`. The last value of `i` is `p * p + p`, and in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `p`, resulting in `i` becoming `p * p + p + p` or `p * p + 2p`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that this new value of `i` (which is `p * p + 2p`) is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` must be at least `(p + 1)^2`, we need to adjust it accordingly to maintain the loop's viability. 

Thus, we need to ensure that:
- `i` is adjusted to `p * p + 2p`
- `n` should be adjusted to ensure `n >= p * p + 2p`

Since `n` is already constrained to be at least `(p + 1)^2`, we can directly state that we will adjust `n` to be at least `p * p + 2p`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= p * p + 2p; i` is `p * p + 2p; prime[i]` is set to `False`**
