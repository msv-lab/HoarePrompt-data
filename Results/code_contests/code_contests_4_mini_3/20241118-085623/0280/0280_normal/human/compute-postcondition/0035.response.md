According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as \( p \times p \) is less than or equal to \( n \). 

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following conditions:
- \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- \( n \) is greater than \( (p + 1)^2 \)
- \( p \) has been increased by 1

After the increment, \( p \) is now \( p + 1 \). For the loop to execute one more time, we need:
\[ (p + 1)(p + 1) \leq n \]
or equivalently,
\[ (p + 1)^2 \leq n \]

Since we know that \( n \) is greater than \( (p + 1)^2 \) after the previous iteration, we need to adjust \( n \) to ensure that it is at least equal to \( (p + 1)^2 \). 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we must specify that \( n \) is at least equal to \( (p + 1)^2 \). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is equal to (p + 1)^2, `p` is increased by 1, the `prime` array remains unchanged**
