Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `p` is 2, and `prime` is a list of `True` values. If `prime[p]` is `True`, the value `p` (which is 2) is appended to the list `f`, resulting in `f` containing at least one instance of 2. If `prime[p]` is `False` (though this case won't occur given the precondition), `f` remains unchanged.***
