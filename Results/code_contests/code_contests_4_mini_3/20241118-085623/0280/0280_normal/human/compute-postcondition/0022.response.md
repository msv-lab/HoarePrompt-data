Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p + 1)^2. If `prime[p]` is True, then for all multiples of `p` starting from `p * p` up to `n`, `prime[i]` is set to False. If `p * p` is greater than `n`, the `prime` array remains unchanged. If `p` is such that `p * p` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, the loop executes for the defined range; otherwise, `prime` remains unchanged.
