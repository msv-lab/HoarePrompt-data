The value at index `i` of the list `prime` is set to `False`. Since `i` is 6, the element at index 6 in the `prime` list will now be `False`. The previous state of index 6 is unknown, but it is now modified. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `p` is 2, `i` is 6, and the element at index 6 in `prime` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `p` is 2, `i` is 6, and `prime[6]` is now `False**
