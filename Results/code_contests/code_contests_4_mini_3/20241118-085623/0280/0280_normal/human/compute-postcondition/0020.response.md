According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `p * p + 2p`, which means it is currently at the starting point for this iteration, and `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= p * p + 2p`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must increase by `p` for the next iteration (the step defined in the `range` function).

Since `i` is currently `p * p + 2p`, the next value of `i` will be `i + p`, which equals `p * p + 2p + p = p * p + 3p`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `p * p + 3p`. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least `p * p + 3p`.
- `i` should be updated to `p * p + 3p`, since that will be the next value of `i` in the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= p * p + 3p; i` is `p * p + 3p; prime[i]` is set to `False`**
