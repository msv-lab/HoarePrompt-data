According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as \( p^2 \) is less than or equal to \( n \). At the end of the last iteration, `p` has been increased by 1, meaning its current value is now \( p + 1 \). 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:

\[
(p + 1)^2 \leq n
\]

Since `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), we need to adjust `n` to ensure that this condition holds. To satisfy the condition, `n` must be at least equal to \( (p + 1)^2 \).

Thus, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to \( (p + 1)^2 \).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p + 1)^2**
