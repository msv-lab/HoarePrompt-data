Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `prime` is a list with `n + 1` elements, all set to `True`; `p` is 2.

Code of the loop:
```
while p * p <= n:
    if prime[p] == True:
        for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
            prime[i] = False
    p += 1
```

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `p` is increased to 3.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 9; `p` is increased to 4.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 16; `p` is increased to 5; the `prime` array remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 25; `p` is increased to 6; the `prime` array remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 36; `p` is increased to 7; the `prime` array remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 6 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 49; `p` is increased to 8; the `prime` array remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 7 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 64; `p` is increased to 9; the `prime` array remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 8 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 81; `p` is increased to 10; the `prime` array remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 9 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to 100; `p` is increased to 11; the `prime` array remains unchanged.

If the initial value of `n` is less than 4, the loop does not execute and `p` remains 2, while `prime` remains a list of `True` values.

Final Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 4 then the loop doesn't execute, `p` is 2, and `prime` is a list of `True` values. If n is 4 or greater, `p` will be incremented until `p * p` exceeds `n`, and `prime` will be modified to reflect non-prime numbers based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes logic.**
