The statement `prime[i] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `i` of the `prime` list. Given that `i` is 8, this means `prime[8]` is set to `False`. The state of `n`, `p`, and `i` remains unchanged, while `prime[6]` was previously `False` and is unaffected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `p` is 2, `i` is 8, `prime[6]` is False, and `prime[8]` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `p` is 2, `i` is 8, `prime[6]` is False, `prime[8]` is now False**
