The value at index `i` in the `prime` list is set to `False`. Given that `i` is 4, the element at index 4 in the `prime` list will now be `False`. The initial state indicates that `prime` is a list with `n + 1` elements, all set to `True`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the list has at least 4 elements. The other variables, `n`, `p`, and `i`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `p` is 2, `i` is 4, `prime` is a list with `n + 1` elements, with the element at index 4 set to `False`**
