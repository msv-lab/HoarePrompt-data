According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `p`, `n`, and the starting point `p * p`. The loop will execute if the starting point `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer constrained by `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= (p + 1)^2`, we can conclude that this ensures the loop has a valid range to execute. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is already defined as greater than or equal to `(p + 1)^2`, which guarantees that `n` is sufficiently large for the loop to start. The initial value of `i` is `p * p`.

For the loop to execute:
1. `p` must be defined and non-negative.
2. The starting value for `i` is `p * p`.
3. Since `n` is already given to be greater than or equal to `(p + 1)^2`, we know that `n` is also at least `p * p`.

Therefore, the loop will execute with the following states:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p + 1)^2, `i` is `p * p`, `p` is a non-negative integer**
