The variable `p` is assigned the value `2`. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the list `prime` is still a list with `n + 1` elements, all set to `True`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `prime` is a list with `n + 1` elements, all set to `True`; `p` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `prime` is a list with `n + 1` elements, all set to `True`; `p` is 2**
