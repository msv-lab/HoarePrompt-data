The line `prime[i] = False` sets the value of `prime` at index `i` to `False`. Given that `i` is defined as `p * p + p`, the specific value of `prime[i]` is updated to `False`. The values of `n` and `p` are not directly altered by this operation, and the state of `prime` at other indices is unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to the `prime` array.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p * p + 2p); `i` is p * p + p; `prime[i]` is set to False.**
