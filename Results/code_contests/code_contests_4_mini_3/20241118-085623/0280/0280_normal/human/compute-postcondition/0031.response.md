According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p * p + 2p). This means that `n` is at least `p * p + 2p`.
- `i` is `p * p + p`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `p` (as per the loop's step definition). Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + p`, which is `(p * p + p) + p` or `p * p + 2p`.

Now, we need to ensure that this new value of `i` (which is `p * p + 2p`) does not exceed `n`. Given that `n` is already greater than or equal to `p * p + 2p`, this condition holds true.

Thus, the states that need adjustment before the next iteration are:
- `i` needs to be updated to `p * p + 2p`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p * p + 2p), `i` is p * p + 2p, `prime[i]` is set to False**
