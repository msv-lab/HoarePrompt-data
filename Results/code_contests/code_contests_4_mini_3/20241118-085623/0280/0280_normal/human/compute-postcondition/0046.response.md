The code appends the value of `p`, which is 3, to the list `f`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 3, `p` is 3, and `prime` is a list of `True` values. The other variables, `n` and `prime`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is that `f` now contains the value 3 appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `p` is 3, `prime` is a list of `True` values, and `f` now contains the value 3 appended to it.**
