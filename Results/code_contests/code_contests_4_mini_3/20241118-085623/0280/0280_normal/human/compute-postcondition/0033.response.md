Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than (p + 1)^2. If `prime[p]` is True, then all indices in the `prime` array from `p * p` to `n` at intervals of `p` are set to False. If `n` is less than `p * p`, the `prime` array remains unchanged. Thus, the state of the `prime` array reflects the primality of numbers up to `n`, depending on the values of `p` and the condition of `prime[p]`.***
