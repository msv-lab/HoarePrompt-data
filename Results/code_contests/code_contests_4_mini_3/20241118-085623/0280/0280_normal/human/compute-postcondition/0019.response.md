The variable `prime[i]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `i` is `p * p + 2p`, which is computed based on the value of `p`. The `n` variable is a positive integer that satisfies the conditions provided, but it is not affected by this assignment. The previous state of `prime[i]` is not specified, but it is now set to `False`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= p * p + 2p; i` is `p * p + 2p; `prime[i]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= p * p + 2p; `i` is `p * p + 2p; `prime[i]` is set to `False`**
