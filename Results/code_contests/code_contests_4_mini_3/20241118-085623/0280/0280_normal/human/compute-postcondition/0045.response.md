According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `p` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2, and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `p` needs to be incremented to 3, while `n` must remain greater than 3 to allow for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state accordingly. 

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `p` is 3, and `prime` is a list of `True` values.**
