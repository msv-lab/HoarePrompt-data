According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `p` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(n \geq (p + 1)^2\). Since `p` has been increased by 1, we need to determine if \( (p + 1) * (p + 1) \) (which is the new value of \(p * p\) after incrementing `p`) is still less than or equal to `n`.

Given that \(n \geq (p + 1)^2\), we can conclude that the loop will not execute again unless we ensure that \(n\) is strictly greater than \((p + 1)^2\) because the current state of `n` is equal to or greater than \((p + 1)^2\) after the increment.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than \((p + 1)^2\).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than (p + 1)^2**
