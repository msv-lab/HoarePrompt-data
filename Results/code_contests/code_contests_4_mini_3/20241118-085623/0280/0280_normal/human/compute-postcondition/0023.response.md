The value of `p` is incremented by 1, affecting the state of the variable `p`. The previous value of `p` is unknown, but the overall condition states that `p` must satisfy certain criteria for the loop to execute. Since `p` is being increased, it may affect whether subsequent conditions regarding the `prime` array are met or not. However, the output state only reflects the change in `p` without knowing its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p + 1)^2; `p` is increased by 1.**
