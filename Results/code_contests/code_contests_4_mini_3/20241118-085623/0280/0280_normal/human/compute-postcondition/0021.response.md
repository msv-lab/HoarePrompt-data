Output State: **`prime[i]` is set to False for all multiples of `p` starting from `p * p` up to `n`. If `p * p` is greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, and `prime` remains unchanged. If `p` is such that `p * p` is at least 1 and less than or equal to 100, the loop will execute for the range defined. If `n` is less than `p * p`, then `prime` will remain unchanged.**
