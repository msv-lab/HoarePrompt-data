The code executes the `append` method on the list `f`, adding the value of `p` to it. The current value of `p` is 2, and since `f` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `f` will contain the single element `[2]`. The other variables `n` and `prime` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 4, `p` is 2, `prime` is a list of `True` values, `f` is now a list containing the element 2, and the value at index `p` of `prime` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 4, `p` is 2, `prime` is a list of `True` values, `f` is now a list containing the element 2, and the value at index `p` of `prime` is `True`**
