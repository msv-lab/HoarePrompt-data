Output State: **`prime` is an array where all indices from `p * p` to `n` with steps of `p` are set to False. If `n` is less than `p * p`, the loop does not execute, and `prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least `p * p`, the loop executes for all values of `i` starting from `p * p` up to `n`, setting `prime[i]` to False for each step of `p`.**
