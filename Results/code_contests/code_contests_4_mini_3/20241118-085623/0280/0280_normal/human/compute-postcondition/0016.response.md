To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the given state and the loop statement.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p)`. This means that the loop starts from `i = p * p` and increments by `p` until it reaches `n + 1`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` is `p * p`, and `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n >= (p + 1)^2`. 

3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` starts at `p * p`, the next value of `i` after the current iteration would be `i + p`, which would be `p * p + p`.

4. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the current value of `i`, the next value `p * p + p` is still less than or equal to `n`.

5. To summarize, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` will be incremented by `p`, thus the new value of `i` should be `p * p + p`. Additionally, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `p * p + p` for the loop to continue executing.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted state should reflect the increment of `i` and ensure that `n` is set accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p + 1)^2; `i` is `p * p + p`; `prime[p * p]` is set to False**
