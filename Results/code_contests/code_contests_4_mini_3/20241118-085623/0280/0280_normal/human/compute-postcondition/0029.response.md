According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop is set to execute for `i` starting from `p * p`, incrementing by `p`, and continuing while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `p * p + p`, which means it will be incremented to `p * p + 2p` for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` remains within the bounds defined by `n`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(n \geq (p * p + p)\), `i` must be adjusted to ensure it does not exceed `n`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` such that it is greater than or equal to `p * p + 2p`, meaning `n` must satisfy the condition \(n \geq (p * p + 2p)\). 

The updated state will therefore reflect that `n` needs to be at least \(p * p + 2p\) for the loop to execute once more.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p * p + 2p); `i` is p * p + p; `prime[i]` is set to False**
