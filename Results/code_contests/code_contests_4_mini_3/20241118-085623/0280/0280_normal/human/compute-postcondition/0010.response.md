Output State: **If n is at least 2, the loop will execute multiple times, setting `prime[i]` to `False` for every multiple of `p` starting from `p * p` up to `n`, where `i` takes values in steps of `p`. After the loop executes, `prime` will reflect which numbers are not prime among the multiples of `p`. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `prime` remains all `True`.**
