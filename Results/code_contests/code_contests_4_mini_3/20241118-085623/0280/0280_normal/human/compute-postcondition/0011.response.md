Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. If `prime[p]` is `True`, for every multiple of `p` starting from `p * p` up to `n`, the corresponding indices in the `prime` list are set to `False`, indicating that those numbers are not prime. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the `prime` list remains unchanged with all values set to `True`.***
