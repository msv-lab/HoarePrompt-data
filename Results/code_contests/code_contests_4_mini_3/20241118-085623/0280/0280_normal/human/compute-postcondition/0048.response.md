According to the code, the loop executes as long as `p` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` needs to be incremented to 4. Since `n` is greater than 3, it allows for `p` to take on the value of 4, so this condition holds true. Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `p` and the implicit understanding that the loop will check `prime[p]` with `p` being 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `p` is 4, and `prime` is a list of `True` values**
