The code assigns `False` to `prime[i]`. Given that `i` is defined as `p * p + p`, and `prime[i]` is set to `False`, the state of `prime[i]` changes accordingly. The other variables (`n` and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p * p + p); `i` is p * p + p; `prime[i]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than or equal to (p * p + p); `i` is p * p + p; `prime[i]` is set to False**
