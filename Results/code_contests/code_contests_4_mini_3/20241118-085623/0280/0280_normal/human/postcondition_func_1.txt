The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object that produces integers obtained from the output of `func_4()`, which is expected to return a whitespace-separated string. However, since `map` returns a map object and not a list, the output is not directly a list of integers unless explicitly converted. Therefore, the actual output is a map object of integers, which can be converted to a list by wrapping it with `list()`. Additionally, if `func_4()` returns an empty string, the result will be an empty map object.
