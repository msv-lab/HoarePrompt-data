The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of all divisors of `n`. It includes both 1 and `n` itself in the list, along with any other divisors found during the iterations. For example, if `n` is 1, the returned list is `[1]`; if `n` is 4, the returned list is `[1, 4, 2]`; if `n` is 9, the returned list is `[1, 9, 3]`. The function handles perfect squares correctly by ensuring the square root is only appended once. It does not handle negative integers or zero, as the expected behavior for those inputs is not defined in the code.
