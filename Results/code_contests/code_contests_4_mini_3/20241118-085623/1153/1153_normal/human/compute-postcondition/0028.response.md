The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 2 to 3. The other variables `r1`, `m1`, and `r2` remain unaffected since they are not involved in the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `i`.

Output State: **`r1` is 0, `i` is 3, `m1` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `r2` remains unchanged**
