The value of `r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The states of the other variables (`r1`, `m1`, and `ts`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `r1` is 0, `i` is 3, `m1` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in the list, and `r2` is 3.

Output State: **`r1` is 0, `i` is 3, `m1` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in the list, `r2` is 3**
