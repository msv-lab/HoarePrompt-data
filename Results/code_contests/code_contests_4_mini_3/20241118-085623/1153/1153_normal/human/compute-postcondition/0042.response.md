Postcondition: ***`r2` is the index of the last occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise it remains unchanged; `i` is the length of `m1` after the loop execution; if `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, if `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` or `r1` is less than or equal to `r2`, 'NO' is printed. Additionally, we ensure that `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s[0]` throughout this process.***
