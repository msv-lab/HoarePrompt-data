The value of `r1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. Therefore, after execution, `r1` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `trump_suit` is a character representing one of the suits ("S", "H", "D", or "C"); `card1` and `card2` are strings representing cards; `s2` is a list of strings from the user's input split by whitespace; `m1` is '6789TJQKA'; `i` is 2; `ts` is '7'; `r1` is 2.
