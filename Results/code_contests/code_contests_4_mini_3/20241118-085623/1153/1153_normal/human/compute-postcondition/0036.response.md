The code executes a print statement that outputs the string "YES". The values of the variables `r2`, `i`, and `m1` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`r2` is the index of the last occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise it remains unchanged; `i` is the length of `m1` after the loop execution; `m1` is not an empty list; `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]`, and `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s[0]` and the output is "YES".**
