Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a character representing one of the suits ("S", "H", "D", or "C"); `card1` and `card2` are strings representing cards; `s2` is a list of strings from the user's input split by whitespace; `m1` is '6789TJQKA'; `i` is 2; `ts` is '7'; if the first character of the first element in `s2` is '6', then `r1` remains unchanged; otherwise, if `ts` equals the first character of the first element in `s2`, then `r1` is set to 2. In all other cases, the value of `r1` remains unchanged.***
