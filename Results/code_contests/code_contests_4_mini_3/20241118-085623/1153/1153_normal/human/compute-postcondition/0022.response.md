The variable `r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The values of `r1`, `m1`, and `ts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `r1` is 0, `i` is 0, `m1` is a list with at least 1 element, and `ts` is equal to the first element of the second sublist of `s2`; `r2` is 0.

Output State: **`r1` is 0, `i` is 0, `m1` is a list with at least 1 element, and `ts` is equal to the first element of the second sublist of `s2`; `r2` is 0**
