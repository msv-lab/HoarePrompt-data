The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 3, so after execution, `i` becomes 4. The values of `r1`, `m1`, `ts`, and `r2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r1` is 0, `i` is 4, `m1` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in the list, and `r2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`r1` is 0, `i` is 4, `m1` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in the list, and `r2` remains unchanged**
