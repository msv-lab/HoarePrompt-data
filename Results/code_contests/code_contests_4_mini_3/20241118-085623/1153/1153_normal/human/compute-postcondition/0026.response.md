The value of `r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous value of `r2` is either 0 or unchanged, but it will now be updated to 2 regardless. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r1` is 0, `i` is 2, `m1` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `r2` is 2.

Output State: **`r1` is 0, `i` is 2, `m1` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `r2` is 2**
