Output State: **`r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1` (which is '6789TJQKA') if that character exists; `i` is equal to the length of `m1` (which is 10); `ts` will take on each character from `m1` during the loop execution; if `s2` is empty, the loop will not execute and `r1` will remain undefined or may retain a previous value if set before. If the first character of `s2[0]` is not found in `m1`, `r1` will remain unchanged.**
