The function `func` accepts three parameters: `trump_suit`, `card1`, and `card2`. The `trump_suit` is a character representing one of the suits ("S", "H", "D", or "C"). The parameters `card1` and `card2` are strings representing two different cards, formatted as "rankSuit", where the rank is one of "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", or "A", and the suit is one of "S", "H", "D", or "C". 

The function's behavior is not specified in detail, but based on the structure, it can be inferred that it likely compares the two cards in relation to the trump suit, potentially determining which card wins or some other game-related logic. However, without specific return conditions given, the exact output is unclear.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter trump_suit (a character representing one of the suits), and two cards card1 and card2 (strings formatted as "rankSuit"), but the return value and specific functionality are not provided.**
