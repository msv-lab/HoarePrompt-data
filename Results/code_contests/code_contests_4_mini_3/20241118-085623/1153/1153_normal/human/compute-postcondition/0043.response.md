Postcondition: ***If `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` and is equal to `s[0]`, 'YES' is printed. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` or `r1` is less than or equal to `r2`, 'NO' is printed. Furthermore, `r2` remains the index of the last occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise it remains unchanged, and `i` is the length of `m1` after the loop execution, which is 0 if `m1` is empty. All conditions on `s2[0][1]` and `s[0]` are consistently maintained throughout.***
