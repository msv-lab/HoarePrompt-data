The function accepts input for two card strings (formatted as "rankSuit") and a trump suit character. It determines if a certain condition based on the ranks and suits of these cards is met. Specifically, it prints 'YES' if the second card's suit is different from the first card's suit and matches the trump suit, or if the suits of both cards are the same but the rank of the first card appears later in the predefined order than that of the second card. It prints 'NO' otherwise. The functionality does not handle cases where the inputs are malformed or empty, which could lead to index errors.
