You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a card game called "Durak", which means "Fool" in Russian. The game is quite popular in the countries that used to form USSR. The problem does not state all the game's rules explicitly — you can find them later yourselves if you want.

To play durak you need a pack of 36 cards. Each card has a suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C") and a rank (in the increasing order "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"). At the beginning of the game one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump. 

The players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards.

A card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards’ ranks are. In all other cases you can not beat the second card with the first one.

You are given the trump suit and two different cards. Determine whether the first one beats the second one or not.

Input

The first line contains the tramp suit. It is "S", "H", "D" or "C".

The second line contains the description of the two different cards. Each card is described by one word consisting of two symbols. The first symbol stands for the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"), and the second one stands for the suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C").

Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes) if the first cards beats the second one. Otherwise, print "NO" (also without the quotes).

    i = 0
    for ts in m1:
        if ts == s2[1][0]:

If `m1` is empty, the loop does not execute, `i` remains 0, and `r2` remains unchanged.
    if (s2[0][1] != s2[1][1] and s2[0][1] == s[0]) :

        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is the length of `m1`, `r1` remains unchanged, and `m1` is a collection of elements. If the values of `s2[0][1]` and `s2[1][1]` are equal and `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, ensuring that `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, or remains unchanged if it does not.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
