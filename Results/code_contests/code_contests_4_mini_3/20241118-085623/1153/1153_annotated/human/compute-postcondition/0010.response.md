The variable `r1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. Other variables (`s`, `s2`, `m1`, `ts`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 2, `ts` is '8', and `r1` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 2, `ts` is '8', and `r1` is 2**
