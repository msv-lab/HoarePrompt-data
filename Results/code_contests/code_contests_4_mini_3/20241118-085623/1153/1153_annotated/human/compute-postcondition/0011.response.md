Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 2, and `ts` is '8'. If `ts` is equal to the first character of the first substring in `s2`, then `r1` is set to the value of `i`, which is 2. If `ts` does not equal `s2[0][0]`, the value of `r1` remains unchanged.***
