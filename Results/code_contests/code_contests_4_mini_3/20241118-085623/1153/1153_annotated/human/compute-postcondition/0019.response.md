The value of `i` is assigned 0, but based on the initial state, if `s2` is non-empty and `s2[0]` is non-empty, `i` would have been 9. However, since the code resets `i` to 0, the previous state of `i` is overwritten. The value of `r1` remains unchanged as there is no operation affecting it in this snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, and `r1` is unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, and `r1` is unchanged**
