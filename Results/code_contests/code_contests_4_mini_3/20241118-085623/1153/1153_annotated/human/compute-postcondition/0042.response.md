Postcondition: ***`i` is the length of `m1`, `r1` remains unchanged, and `m1` is a collection of elements. If the values of `s2[0][1]` and `s2[1][1]` are equal and `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, ensuring that `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, or remains unchanged if it does not.***
