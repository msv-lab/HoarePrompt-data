The variable `r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1, `r1` is unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `ts` is the second element in `m1`, and `r2` is now 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r1` is unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `ts` is the second element in `m1`, and `r2` is 1**
