The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. The other variables (`r1`, `m1`, `ts`, and `r2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1, `r1` is unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 1 element, `ts` is the first element in `m1`, and `r2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r1` is unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 1 element, `ts` is the first element in `m1`, and `r2` remains unchanged**
