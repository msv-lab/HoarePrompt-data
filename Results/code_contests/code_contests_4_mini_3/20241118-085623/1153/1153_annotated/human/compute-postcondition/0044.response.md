The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since it is defined without any arguments. However, it operates on the assumption that there are external inputs related to the trump suit and two cards. The trump suit is a single character that can be one of 'S', 'H', 'D', or 'C'. Each card is represented as a string consisting of two characters: the first character is a rank ('6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'), and the second character is a suit ('S', 'H', 'D', or 'C'). Additionally, the two cards must be different.

The output behavior of the function is determined by these inputs but is not explicitly detailed in the provided information. Therefore, based on the constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a trump suit (a single character 'S', 'H', 'D', or 'C') and two different cards (each represented as a string of two characters). It processes these inputs to determine the result based on the rules of the game being implemented.**
