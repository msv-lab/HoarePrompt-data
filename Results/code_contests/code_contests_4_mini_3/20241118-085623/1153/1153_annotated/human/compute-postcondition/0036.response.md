The code `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES' to the console. It does not modify any existing variables or their values. The previous state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`i` is the length of `m1`, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection of elements, `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged, the value of `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]`, the value of `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s[0]`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
