Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 4, and `ts` is 'T'. If the first character of the first substring in `s2` matches `ts`, then `r1` is set to 4. If there is no match, `r1` remains unchanged.***
