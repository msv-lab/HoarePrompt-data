Postcondition: ***`i` is the length of `m1`, `r1` remains unchanged, and `m1` is a collection of elements. If `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` and `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s[0]`, 'YES' is printed. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, 'NO' is printed. Additionally, if `m1` is empty, `i` remains 0, and `r2` remains unchanged. The value of `r2` is either the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists or remains unchanged if it does not.***
