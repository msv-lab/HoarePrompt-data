The variable `s2` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes user input, splits the input string into a list of substrings, and assigns that list to `s2`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is a string representing two different cards. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string representing two different cards, and `s2` is a list containing the substrings obtained from the user input.

Output State: **`s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing the substrings obtained from the user input**
