The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The values of `r1`, `m1`, and `r2` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 2 elements, and `r2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 2 elements, and `r2` remains unchanged.**
