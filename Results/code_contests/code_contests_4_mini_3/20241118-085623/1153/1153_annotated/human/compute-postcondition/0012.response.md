The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables (`s`, `s2`, `m1`, `ts`, and `r1`) remain unchanged as the code only modifies `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 3, and `ts` is '8'.

Output State: **`s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 3, and `ts` is '8'**
