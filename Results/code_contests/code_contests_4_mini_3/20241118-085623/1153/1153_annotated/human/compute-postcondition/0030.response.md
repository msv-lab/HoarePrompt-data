The variable `r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `r1`, `m1`, and `r2` remain unchanged, except for `r2`, which now takes on the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 3 elements, `r2` is 2**
