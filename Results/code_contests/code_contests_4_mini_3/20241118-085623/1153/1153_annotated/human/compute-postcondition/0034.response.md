Output State: **`i` is the length of `m1`, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection of elements, `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged. If `m1` is empty, the loop does not execute, `i` remains 0, and `r2` remains unchanged.**
