The variable `r1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 4. The other variables (`s`, `s2`, `m1`, `ts`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables, including the new value for `r1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 4, `ts` is 'T', and `r1` is 4**
