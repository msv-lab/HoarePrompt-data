The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 4 to 5. The states of the other variables (`s`, `s2`, `m1`, `ts`, `r1`) are not affected since only `i` is modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 5, and `ts` is 'T'.

Output State: **`s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing substrings obtained from user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 5, and `ts` is 'T'**.
