The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing `i` from 2 to 3. The values of `r1`, `m1`, and `r2` remain unchanged, as the code only affects `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 3 elements, and `r2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection with at least 3 elements, and `r2` remains unchanged**
