The variable `m1` is assigned the string value `'6789TJQKA'`. This assignment does not affect any other variables, including `s` and `s2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `s` and `s2`, along with the newly assigned value of `m1`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string representing two different cards, `s2` is a list containing the substrings obtained from the user input, `m1` is '6789TJQKA'**
