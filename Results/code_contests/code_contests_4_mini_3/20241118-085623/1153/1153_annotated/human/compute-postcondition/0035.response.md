Postcondition: ***`i` is the length of `m1`, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection of elements, `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged. The value of `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` and the value of `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s[0]`.***
