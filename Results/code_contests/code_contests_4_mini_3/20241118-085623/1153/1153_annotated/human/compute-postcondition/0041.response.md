The code prints 'NO', and the values of the variables `i`, `r1`, `m1`, and `r2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is the length of `m1`, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection of elements, `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`i` is the length of `m1`, `r1` remains unchanged, `m1` is a collection of elements, `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.**
