The trump suit is a single character that is either 'S', 'H', 'D', or 'C'. The two cards are represented as strings with two characters each, where the first character is a rank ('6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A') and the second character is a suit ('S', 'H', 'D', or 'C'). The two cards must be different.
