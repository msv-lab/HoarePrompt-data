The function accepts input in the form of a trump suit and two cards, each represented as strings of two characters. It checks the ranks of the first characters of the two cards against a predefined order and compares the second characters of each card. It prints 'YES' if the first card's second character matches the trump suit and if the second characters of both cards are different, or if both second characters are the same and the first card has a higher rank than the second. In all other cases, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input strings may be empty or not well-formed, leading to potential index errors.
