Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining if one card beats another is incomplete. 

### Problematic Case:
Consider the input where the first card is a trump card, and the second card is not a trump card. The current implementation does not check whether the first card is a trump card when both cards are of different suits. 

For example:
- Input:
```
H
6H 9D
```
Here, 'H' is the trump suit. The first card '6H' is not a trump card, and the second card '9D' is also not a trump card. According to the rules, since both cards are not trumps but are of different suits, the first card should not beat the second card, and the output should be "NO". However, the current program logic does not take this into account correctly.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where both cards are of the same suit but the first card is of a lower rank than the second card correctly when ranks are equal. 

Therefore, since the program does not account for these cases, it is incorrect.
