t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); for each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of items (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and W is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18); w_i are positive integers representing the weights of the items (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9) and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
