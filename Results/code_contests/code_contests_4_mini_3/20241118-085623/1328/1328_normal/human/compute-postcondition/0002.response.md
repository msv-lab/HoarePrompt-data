The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, `sep`, `file`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the updated value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is True**
