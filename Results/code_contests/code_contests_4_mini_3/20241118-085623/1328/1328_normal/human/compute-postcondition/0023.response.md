Output State: **`file` has been modified by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is False, `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i` remain unchanged, `kwargs` has had the value of 'flush' removed, which is True; and `file.flush()` is called, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the file.**
