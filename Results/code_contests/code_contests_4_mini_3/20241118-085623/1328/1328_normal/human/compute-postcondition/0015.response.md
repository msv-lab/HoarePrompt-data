The code snippet `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The initial state indicates that `sep` is a string containing a single space (' '). Other variables in the initial state are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is that `sep` is a space, and the `file` now contains an additional space written to it.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `W` is a positive integer, `w_i` are positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` has the string representation of the third element of `args` followed by a space and then `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, and a space has been written to `file`.**
