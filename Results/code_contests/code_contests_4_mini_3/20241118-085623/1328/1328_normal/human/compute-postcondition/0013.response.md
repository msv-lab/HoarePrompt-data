The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, but its previous value is already `False`. Therefore, there is no change in the state of `at_start`. The states of other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `W` is a positive integer, `w_i` are positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` has the string representation of the second element of `args` followed by a space and then `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element of `args`.**
