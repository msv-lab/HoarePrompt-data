The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, but it was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unaffected. The output state is: `t`, `n`, `W` are positive integers, `w_i` are positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` now contains the string representation of the third element of `args` followed by a space and then `x`, and `at_start` is False.
