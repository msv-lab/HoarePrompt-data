Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element of args, and a space (' ') has been written to `file`. If `at_start` is True, no changes are made to `file`.***
