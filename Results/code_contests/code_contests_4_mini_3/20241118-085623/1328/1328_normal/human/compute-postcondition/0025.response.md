The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `W`, along with a list of weights `w_i` for each test case. Here, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, with a constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `W` is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack, with a maximum value of 10^18. The weights of the items, denoted as `w_i`, are positive integers constrained by 1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9. The total number of items across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.

The function processes the input based on the test cases and returns a result for each test case. The specific output for each test case may vary based on the conditions and the knapsack problem being solved. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, for each test case a number of items `n`, and the knapsack capacity `W`, along with a list of weights `w_i`, and returns results based on the knapsack problem for each test case.**
