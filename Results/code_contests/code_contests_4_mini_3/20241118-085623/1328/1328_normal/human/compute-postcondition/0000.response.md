Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The code snippet does not change any variable values but indicates the intention to print values to a stream.**
