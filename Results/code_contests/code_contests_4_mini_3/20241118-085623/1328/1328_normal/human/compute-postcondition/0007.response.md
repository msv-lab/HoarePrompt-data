The variable `x` is the first element of `args`, and the code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `at_start` is False, a space (' ') has already been written to `file`. The output state reflects that `file` now contains the space followed by the string representation of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is ' ', `file` has the string representation of `x` written after a space, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element of `args`.**
