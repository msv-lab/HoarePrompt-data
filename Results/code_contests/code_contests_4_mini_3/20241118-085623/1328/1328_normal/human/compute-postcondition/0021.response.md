The code snippet calls the `write` method on `file`, writing a value that is retrieved from `kwargs` using the `pop` method. The `pop` method removes the item associated with the key `'end'` from `kwargs` and returns its value, which is then written to `file`. If the key `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to `'\n'`, a newline character. The previous values of `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `file` has been modified by writing the value of `kwargs['end']` (or `'\n'` if it doesn't exist), and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`file` is modified by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is False, `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i` remain unchanged**.
