Output State: **`file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` if `args` is a non-empty iterable. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute and `file` remains unchanged. `at_start` will always be False after the first iteration, and `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i` remain unchanged throughout the loop.**
