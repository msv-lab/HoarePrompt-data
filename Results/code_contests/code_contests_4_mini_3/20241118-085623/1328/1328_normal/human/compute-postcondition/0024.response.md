Postcondition: ***`file` has been modified by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is False, `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i` remain unchanged. If `kwargs` contained 'flush' with a value of True, `file.flush()` is called to ensure that all buffered output is written to the file. If 'flush' was not present or was False, no flushing occurs, and all other variables remain unchanged.***
