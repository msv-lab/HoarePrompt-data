t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is a positive integer representing the number of items (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), W is a positive integer representing the knapsack capacity (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), and w_i are positive integers representing the weights of the items (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
