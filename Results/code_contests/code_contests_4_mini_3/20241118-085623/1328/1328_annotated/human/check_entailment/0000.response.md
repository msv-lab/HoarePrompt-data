Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not implement any logic related to the problem description about filling a knapsack with specified constraints on weights. It contains placeholder functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) with `func_2` being a misnamed function that seems to handle printing arguments rather than solving the knapsack problem.

Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:
1. **Missing Logic**: There are no functions or logic that address the requirement to fill the knapsack with weights between ⌈ W/2⌉ and W. The program lacks the necessary code to read input, process test cases, and determine which items can be added to the knapsack.
2. **Output Handling**: The program does not have any mechanism to output the indices of items or -1 when no solution is possible, as required by the problem description.
3. **No Iteration Over Test Cases**: The program does not loop through multiple test cases, nor does it handle the input format specified in the problem statement.

Given that the program does not address the problem requirements at all, it is correct to conclude that it is incorrect.
