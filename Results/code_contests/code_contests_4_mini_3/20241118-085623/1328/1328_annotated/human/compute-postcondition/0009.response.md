According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. Since `args` is a non-empty iterable, it has already provided at least one value for `x` during the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have remaining elements. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been written to `file`, which means `x` was the last element processed from `args`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `args` must have at least one more element left, making its size greater than 1. Additionally, we need to adjust `x` to be the next element in the iterable.

State: **`t`, `n`, `W` are positive integers; `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `at_start` is False; `args` has at least 2 elements; `x` is the next element in `args`.**
