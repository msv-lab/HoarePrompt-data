The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The values of `t`, `n`, `W`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that `sep` has been written to the `file`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W` are positive integers; `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `x` is the first element in `args`, and `sep` has been written to `file`.**
