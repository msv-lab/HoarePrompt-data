The value of `at_start` is assigned to `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False` (assuming it was `True` initially since it indicates whether it is the start). The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `W`, `sep`, `file`, `args`, and `x`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t`, `n`, `W` are positive integers; `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `x` has been written to `file`.
