Output State: **If `args` is a non-empty iterable, then `file` will contain the string representations of the elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` will be False after the first iteration. If `args` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `file` will remain unchanged, `at_start` will remain True.**
