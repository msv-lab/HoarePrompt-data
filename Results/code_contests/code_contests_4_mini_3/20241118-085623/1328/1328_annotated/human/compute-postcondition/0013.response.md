The value of `at_start` is set to `False`, but no other variables are affected by this assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t`, `n`, `W` are positive integers; `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `at_start` is False; `args` has at least 2 elements; and the method `write` is called on `file`, writing the value of `str(x)`.
