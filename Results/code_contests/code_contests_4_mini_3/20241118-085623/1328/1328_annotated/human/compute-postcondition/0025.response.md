The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts parameters `n` and `W`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, and `W` is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack. Additionally, the function processes a list of weights `w_i` for the items. The function does not return a specific value but rather ensures that the total weight `C` of selected items satisfies the condition ⌈ W/2⌉ ≤ C ≤ W for each test case. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a positive integer `n` for the number of items and a positive integer `W` for the knapsack capacity, while processing item weights to ensure the total weight of selected items falls within the specified range.**
