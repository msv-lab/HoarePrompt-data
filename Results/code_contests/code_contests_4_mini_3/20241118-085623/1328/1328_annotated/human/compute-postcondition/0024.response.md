Postcondition: ***`file` remains unchanged if `args` is empty. If `args` is non-empty, `file` is modified to include the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs` has `flush` with a value of True, then `file.flush()` is called. If `flush` is False or not present in `kwargs`, no operation occurs on `file`.***
