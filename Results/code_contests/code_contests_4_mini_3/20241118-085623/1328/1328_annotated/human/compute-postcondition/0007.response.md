The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The variable `x` is the first element of `args`, which is a non-empty iterable. No other variables are modified by this action, and the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, `W`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args`, while noting that `x` has been written to `file`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W` are positive integers; `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `at_start` is a boolean indicating whether it is the start; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `x` has been written to `file`.**
