Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `W` are positive integers; `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `at_start` is False; `args` has at least 2 elements; if `at_start` is False, the method `write` is called on `file`, writing the value of `sep`. If `at_start` were True, no action is taken and the state remains unchanged.***
