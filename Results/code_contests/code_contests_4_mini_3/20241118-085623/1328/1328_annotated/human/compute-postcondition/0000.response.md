Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), and the weights `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The total weight `C` of selected items must satisfy ⌈ W/2⌉ ≤ C ≤ W.**
