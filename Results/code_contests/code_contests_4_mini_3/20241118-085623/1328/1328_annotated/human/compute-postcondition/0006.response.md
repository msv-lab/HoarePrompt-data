Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `W` are positive integers; `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`; `at_start` is a boolean indicating whether it is the start; `args` is a non-empty iterable, with `x` being the first element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to `file`. If `at_start` is True, no action is taken regarding `file` and `sep`.***
