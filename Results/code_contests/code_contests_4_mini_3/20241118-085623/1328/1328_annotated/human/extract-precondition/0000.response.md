Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of items, and W is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18) representing the capacity of the knapsack; w_i (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9) are positive integers representing the weights of the items such that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The total weight C of selected items must satisfy ⌈ W/2⌉ ≤ C ≤ W.**
