According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. Since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the first element in `arr` during the first iteration. 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `arr` has at least 1 element and to initialize `i` as the first element of `arr`.

State: **`t` is a deque with 0 elements, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
