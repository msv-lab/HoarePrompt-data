According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The loop will continue executing as long as there are still elements in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in `arr`, which suggests that there is at least one more element (the third element) in the list for the loop to execute again.

Since `arr` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is currently the second element, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` should be updated to the third element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 0 elements, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the value popped from `t`.**
