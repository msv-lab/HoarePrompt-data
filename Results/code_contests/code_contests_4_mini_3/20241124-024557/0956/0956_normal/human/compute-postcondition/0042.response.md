According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element in `arr`, which means `arr` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the fourth element in `arr`.

Since `arr` has at least 3 elements, it implies that it has at least 4 elements for the loop to continue executing. The state of `t` and `m` does not affect the ability of the loop to continue, and thus they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a deque with at least one less element, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the value popped from `t`.**
