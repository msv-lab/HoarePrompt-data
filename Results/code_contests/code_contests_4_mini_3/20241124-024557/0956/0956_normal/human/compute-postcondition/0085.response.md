According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` variable. The loop will continue as long as `arr` has elements to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a non-empty list of zeros with at least 1 element remaining. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` should still have at least 1 element.

The other variables `t`, `m`, `n`, `s`, and `poss` do not need to be adjusted for this loop iteration since the loop solely depends on `arr` to continue execution. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be confirmed is that `arr` must still be a non-empty list of zeros.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of zeros with at least 1 element remaining, `t` has length at least 1 after one element is removed, `m` has sufficient elements, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string or empty string depending on the case; `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
