To analyze the provided loop, we start with the initial state:

- The deque `t` has 0 elements.
- The deque `m` has 0 elements.
- The list `arr` is empty.

The code of the loop is as follows:

```
for i in range(len(t) // 2):
    poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]
    arr[i] = m.popleft()
```

### Analysis of Loop Execution:
1. The loop's termination condition is `len(t) // 2`. Since `t` has 0 elements, `len(t)` is 0, and thus `len(t) // 2` is also 0. Therefore, the loop will **not execute** at all. 

### Missing Logic and Edge Cases:
- Since both `t` and `m` are empty, any attempt to access `m[0]` or `t.popleft()` within the loop would lead to an error due to trying to access or pop from an empty deque.
- If `t` and `m` remain empty, the loop will not execute, and the variables will retain their initial values.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **If `t` and `m` are both empty, the loop does not execute, `t` remains a deque with 0 elements, `m` remains a deque with 0 elements, `arr` remains an empty list, and `i` is never defined. If `t` has at least one element and `m` is empty, an error occurs due to attempting to pop from an empty deque.**
