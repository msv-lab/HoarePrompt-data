To analyze the given code snippet, we need to assess how it affects the variables based on the initial state provided.

1. `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T'.
2. `t` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are 'T'.
3. `len(m)` gives the count of non-'T' characters in `s`.
4. `len(t)` gives the count of 'T' characters in `s`.
5. The expression `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` evaluates whether the number of non-'T' characters (doubled) is equal to the number of 'T' characters in the string `s`.

The output state will depend on the values of `len(t)` and `len(m)`, which are determined by the content of the string `s`. However, since we don't have the specific content of `s`, we can only state the relationship established by the condition without determining specific numerical values.

The output state will reflect that the variable `poss` is assigned the boolean value of the expression and that `t` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` and `m` remain unchanged; `poss` is assigned the value of the expression `len(m) * 2 == len(t)`**.
