The value of `i` is appended to the deque `t`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `i` to `t`.

Output State: **`t` has `i` appended to it; `m` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `arr` is a list of zeros, `i` is 2, and `si` is the third character of `s`.**
