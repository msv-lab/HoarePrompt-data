The code appends the current value of `i` to the deque `t`. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `t` will contain the value 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is now a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a list of zeros, and `i` is 0, with `si` equal to 'T'.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a list of zeros, `i` is 0, and `si` is 'T'**
