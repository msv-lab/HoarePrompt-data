Postcondition: ***`sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the second element of `args`. If `at_start` is False, the current content of `file` now includes the string representation of `x` followed by the value of `sep`; otherwise, the content of `file` remains unchanged.***
