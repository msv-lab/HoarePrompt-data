Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that may contain 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains empty. `m` is a deque that may contain 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T', otherwise `m` remains empty. The condition `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is false, `poss` is true, the function returns 'YES', `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, and `si` is the first character of `s`.***
