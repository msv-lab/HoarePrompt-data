The code appends the current value of `i`, which is 0, to the deque `m`. Since `m` is initially empty, after this operation, `m` will contain the value `0`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a list of zeros, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a list of zeros, `i` is 0**
