The code updates the boolean variable `poss` using a bitwise AND operation with the condition `i < t.popleft()`. The value of `t` has at least 2 elements (as per the initial state), so `t.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of `t`, allowing us to evaluate the condition. The previous value of `poss` is unknown, and we cannot determine the exact outcome of the operation without knowing the specific values of `i` and the element returned by `t.popleft()`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `poss` is updated but does not specify the exact value since we don't have the initial values of `poss` or `i`.

Output State: **`arr` contains at least 1 element, `m` has sufficient elements to populate `arr`, `len(t)` is greater than or equal to 2, `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
