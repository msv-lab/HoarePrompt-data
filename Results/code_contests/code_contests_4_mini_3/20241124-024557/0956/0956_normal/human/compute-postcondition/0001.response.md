The code snippet assigns values to the variables `sep` and `file` by popping them from `kwargs` with default values of ' ' (space) and `sys.stdout`, respectively. The initial state specifies constraints on `t` and `n`, but does not provide specific values for `kwargs`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment process without any changes to other variables.

Output State: **`sep` is either the value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`**
