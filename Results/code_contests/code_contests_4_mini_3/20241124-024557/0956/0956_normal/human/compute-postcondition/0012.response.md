The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `at_start` is False, the content of `file` now includes the string representation of `x` followed by the value of `sep`. The variables `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the second element of `args`. The content of `file` now includes the string representation of `x`.**
