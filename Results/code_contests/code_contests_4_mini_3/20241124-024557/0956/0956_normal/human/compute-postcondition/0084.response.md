The variable `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`. The `popleft()` method removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`. The value of `i` is compared with this returned value, and the result of this comparison is combined with the current value of `poss` using the bitwise AND operator `&=`. The state of `arr` and `s` remains unaffected by this operation, while `t` will lose its first element, and `poss` will now reflect whether `i` was less than the first element of `t`. The length of `t` is at least 2, so there will still be elements remaining in `t` after this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of zeros with at least 1 element remaining, `t` has length at least 1 after one element is removed, `m` has sufficient elements, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string or empty string depending on the case; `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
