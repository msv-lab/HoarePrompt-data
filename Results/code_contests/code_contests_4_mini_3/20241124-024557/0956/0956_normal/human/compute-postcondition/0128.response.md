According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr`. If `arr` contains at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 1 element. For the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must still contain at least 1 element, and `i` must take the next value in `arr`.

Since the loop iterates over `arr`, if the last iteration consumed the first element, then for the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `arr`. However, the exact state of `arr` isn't provided, but we know it must still have at least 1 element remaining after the last iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr` has at least 1 element remaining for the next iteration and `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` contains at least 1 element, `m` has sufficient elements to populate `arr`, `len(t)` is greater than or equal to 2, `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft(), i is the next element in arr`**
