To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current state and the behavior of the loop.

The loop is defined as:
```
for (i, si) in enumerate(s):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that `i` takes on values starting from `0` and increases by `1` with each iteration, while `si` takes on the corresponding characters from the string `s`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is a deque that may have changed based on the first character of `s` and `si`.
- `m` is a deque that may have changed based on the first character of `s` and `si`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `arr` is a list of zeros.
- `i` is `1`.
- `si` is the second character of `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`, which corresponds to the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, which means that in the next iteration, `i` will be `2`, and `si` will be the third character of `s`. 

To ensure that the loop can continue:
- We must ensure that `i` is adjusted to `2`.
- We need to make sure that `si` corresponds to the third character of `s`.

Since `s` is non-empty and has at least three characters for the loop to execute one more time, we can state that.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `i` should be `2`.
- `si` should be the third character of `s`.

State: **`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T' and has 1 appended if `si` is 'T'; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. `m` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T' and has 1 appended if `si` is not 'T'; otherwise, `m` remains unchanged. `n` remains unchanged, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `arr` is a list of zeros, `i` is 2, and `si` is the third character of `s`.**
