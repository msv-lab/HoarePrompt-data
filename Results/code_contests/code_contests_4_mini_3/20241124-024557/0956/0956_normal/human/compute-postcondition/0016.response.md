Postcondition: ***`sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element of `args`. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to `file`; otherwise, there is no action taken regarding writing to `file`.***
