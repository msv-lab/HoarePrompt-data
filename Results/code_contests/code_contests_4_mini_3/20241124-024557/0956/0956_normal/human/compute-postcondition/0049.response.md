The code `t = deque()` reassigns `t` to a new empty deque, which means it no longer holds the previous elements. Since `t` is now an empty deque, the previously stated conditions `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` and the fact that `t` had at least 1 element no longer hold true. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is false, `poss` is true, the function returns 'YES', `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is false, `poss` is true, the function returns 'YES', `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string.**
