Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T' and has 1 appended if `si` is 'T'; if `si` is 'T', then `t` has `i` appended to it. `m` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T' and has 1 appended if `si` is not 'T'; if `si` is not 'T', then `m` has `i` appended to it. `n` remains unchanged, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `arr` is a list of zeros, and `i` is 2.***
