The variable `m` is assigned a new empty `deque`, which means it will now contain 0 elements instead of the previous state of having `len(m)` elements. The other variables (`t`, `len(t)`, `poss`, the return value, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is false, `poss` is true, the function returns 'YES', `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string**
