According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `arr`. If `arr` contains at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 2 elements. To allow for one more execution of the loop, `arr` needs to contain at least 3 elements. Additionally, since `i` is taken from `arr` and represents the current element in the iteration, it needs to be adjusted to reflect the next element in `arr` which would be the third element (assuming there are enough elements).

State: **`arr` contains at least 3 elements, `m` has sufficient elements to populate `arr`, `len(t)` is greater than or equal to 2, `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft(), i is the third element in arr`**
