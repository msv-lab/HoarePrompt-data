The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the variables `sep` and `file` remain unchanged since this line does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `at_start` along with the unchanged states of `sep` and `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is either the value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True**
