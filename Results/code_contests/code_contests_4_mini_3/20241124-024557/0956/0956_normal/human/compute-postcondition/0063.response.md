The operation `m.append(i)` adds the value of `i`, which is 2, to the deque `m`. Since `m` may already contain elements, it will now contain the previous elements along with the new element `2`. The states of the other variables, `t`, `si`, and `poss`, are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` and `m` are deques that may contain 0 based on the first character of `s`, `i` is 2, `si` is the third character of `s` if it exists, and `poss` remains true; `m` now contains the value 2 appended to it.**
