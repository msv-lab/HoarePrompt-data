Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` remain unchanged. If `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` and `len(t)` is at least 2, then `arr` contains the first half of the elements from `m`, `poss` reflects whether all elements popped from `t` were less than the corresponding elements in `arr`, and `len(t)` is effectively reduced by the number of elements processed. If `len(t)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, resulting in `arr` being a list of zeros, `t` remaining unchanged, and `poss` retaining its initial value.***
