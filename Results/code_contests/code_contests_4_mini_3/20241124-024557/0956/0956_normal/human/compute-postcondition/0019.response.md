According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it depends on the iterable `args`. If `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements and we are currently on the third element, we need to ensure that there are more elements to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `args` contains at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element of `args`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must move to the fourth element of `args`. Therefore, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 4 elements, `x` is the fourth element of `args`, and `file` has received the string representation of `x`**
