According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has more than 1 element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the second element of `args`, and since `args` is a non-empty iterable, we need to determine if there are more elements to iterate over.

Since `x` is currently the second element of `args`, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must contain at least 3 elements. Therefore, `x` should be adjusted to the third element of `args`.

State: **`sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element of `args`**
