The line of code `arr[i] = m.popleft()` results in the following impacts:

1. `m.popleft()` removes and returns the first element of the deque `m`. Since `m` remains unchanged prior to this operation, it will have its first element removed.
2. The removed value from `m` is assigned to `arr[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means that `arr[2]` will now hold the value that was the first element of `m` before the operation.

The state of the other variables (`t`, `poss`, and the unchanged `m`) is not directly impacted by this line of code. The length of `t` is still at least 4, `m` has one less element, and `poss` remains updated based on its prior comparison.

Therefore, the output state, reflecting these changes, is:

Output State: **`t` has a length of at least 4, `m` now has one less element, `arr` contains the new value at index 2 from the removed first element of `m`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison with the result of `t.popleft() < m[0]`.**
