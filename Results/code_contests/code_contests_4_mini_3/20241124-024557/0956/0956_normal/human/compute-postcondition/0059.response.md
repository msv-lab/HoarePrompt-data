Output State: **`t` is a deque that may contain 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains empty; `m` is a deque that may contain 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T', otherwise `m` remains empty; `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is false; `poss` is true; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1; `si` is the second character of `s` (if it exists) or the first character of `s` (if `s` has only one character); `m` now contains the value 1 appended to it.**
