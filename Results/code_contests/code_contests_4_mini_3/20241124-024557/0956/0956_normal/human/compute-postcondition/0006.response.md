Postcondition: ***`sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is a boolean variable indicating the starting state, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element of `args`. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to `file`; otherwise, nothing is written to `file`.***
