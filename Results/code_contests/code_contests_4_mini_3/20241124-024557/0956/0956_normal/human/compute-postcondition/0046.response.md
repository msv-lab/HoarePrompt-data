According to the code, the for loop will iterate based on the length of the deque `t`. Since `t` is a deque with 0 elements, the loop will not execute at all, as there are no iterations to perform.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `t` with 0 elements, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must have at least 1 element. The condition `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is already satisfied with both `len(m)` and `len(t)` being 0, so we do not need to change `m`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Since `poss` is true and the function returns 'YES', we can assume that `t` can be modified accordingly.

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 element, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is true, `poss` is true, and the function returns 'YES'**
