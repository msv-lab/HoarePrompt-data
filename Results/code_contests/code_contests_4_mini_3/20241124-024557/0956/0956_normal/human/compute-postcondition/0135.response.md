The function `func_2` is called with the argument `'YES'` if `poss` is `True`, otherwise it is called with `'NO'`. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the initial condition of `poss` which determines the string passed to `func_2`.

Since the specific values of `t`, `m`, and `poss` are not provided, we conclude that `poss` could be either `True` or `False`. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `t` and `m` remain unchanged, and `poss` determines whether `'YES'` or `'NO'` is returned.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, and `func_2` is called with 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise with 'NO'.**
