The value of `i` is appended to the deque `m`. Since `i` is currently 0, `m` will now contain the value 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` now contains 0, `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is false, `poss` is true, the function returns 'YES', `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is not 'T'.
