Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes multiple test cases where it checks if a valid arrangement of characters 'T' and 'M' can be formed based on specific conditions. For each test case, it reads a string and determines if the number of 'M's is half that of 'T's, and if the indices of 'T's can be arranged in a valid order with respect to 'M's. It outputs 'YES' if the arrangement is possible and 'NO' otherwise. However, there is no return value from the function, and it relies on an external function `func_2` to handle the output. **
