The code assigns a new empty deque to the variable `m`. The previous state of the variable `m` is unchanged, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `arr`) remain as they were. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` is now an empty deque, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `arr` is a list of zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `arr` is a list of zeros**
