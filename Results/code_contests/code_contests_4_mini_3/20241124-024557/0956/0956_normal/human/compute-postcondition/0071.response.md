The operation `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]` modifies the value of `poss`. The `popleft()` method removes and returns the first element of the deque `t`. The comparison `t.popleft() < m[0]` will evaluate to either `True` or `False`, and the result will be combined with the current value of `poss` using the logical AND assignment operator `&=`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `t` has a length of at least 2, `t.popleft()` will successfully return a value. The exact values of `m[0]` and the popped value from `t` are not specified, but `poss` will be updated based on the comparison.

Output State: **`t` has length at least 1, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string or empty string depending on the case, `arr` is a list of zeros with length len(t) // 2, `i` is 0**
