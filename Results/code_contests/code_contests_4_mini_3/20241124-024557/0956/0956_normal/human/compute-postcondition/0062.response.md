The value of `i` is appended to the deque `t`. The state of `t` will change with the addition of the value `2`, but the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is the deque with the value `2` added, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `si` is the third character of `s` if it exists, and `poss` is true.

Output State: **`t` is the deque with the value 2 added, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `si` is the third character of `s` if it exists, `poss` is true**.
