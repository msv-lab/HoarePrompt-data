The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `at_start` is not specified, but it indicates that the state is now set to not being at the start. The other variables (`sep`, `file`, `args`, and `x`) remain unaffected and retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element of `args`, and `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.
