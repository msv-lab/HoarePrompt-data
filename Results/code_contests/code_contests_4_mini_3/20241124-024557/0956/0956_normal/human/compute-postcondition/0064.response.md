Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques that may contain 0 based on the first character of `s`. If `si` is 'T', then `t` has the value 2 appended to it, while `m` remains unchanged. If `si` is not 'T', then `m` has the value 2 appended to it, while `t` remains unchanged. In either case, `i` is 2, `si` is the third character of `s` if it exists, and `poss` remains true.***
