According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `t`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has length at least 3 after popping the first element, which implies that the length of `t` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time (since `len(t) // 2` must be at least 2). 

Since `i` is currently set to the current iteration index, we can infer that `i` is 2 at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The length of `t` must be at least 4.
- The value of `i` must be adjusted to 3.

State: **`t` has length at least 4 after popping the first element; `m` has been modified; `poss` is updated based on the comparison between the popped element from `t` and the first element of `m`; `arr[i]` is assigned the value of the first element from `m` after it has been popped; `i` is 3**
