The code writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The variable `sep` may be a specific value from `kwargs` or a space, and the variable `file` may also take a specific value from `kwargs` or default to `sys.stdout`. The other variables (`at_start`, `args`, and `x`) remain unaffected in this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is either from `kwargs` or a space; `file` is either from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element of `args`, and `sep` is written to `file`.
