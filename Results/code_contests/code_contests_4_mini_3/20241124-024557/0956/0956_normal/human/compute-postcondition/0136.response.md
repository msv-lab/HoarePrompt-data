According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `t` indicates the number of iterations. The loop iterates `t` times, starting from 0 to `t-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` remains unchanged, which implies that the loop has already executed all of its iterations.

To execute the loop one more time, `t` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` is now greater than its previous value, allowing for one additional iteration. The values of `m` and the result of `func_2` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's control.

State: **`t` is greater than the previous value, `m` remains unchanged, `func_2` is called with 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise with 'NO'**
