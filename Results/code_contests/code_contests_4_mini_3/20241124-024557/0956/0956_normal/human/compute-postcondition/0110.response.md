According to the code, the loop will execute again if the `i` is less than the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the loop has processed the first three characters of `s` (indices 0, 1, and 2). 

Since `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, the next index `i` would be 3 to access the 4th character of `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted as `t`, `m`, and `n` do not change before the next iteration based on the loop's structure.

State: **`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T' and has 1 appended if `si` is 'T'; if `si` is 'T', then `t` has `i` appended to it. `m` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T' and has 1 appended if `si` is not 'T'; if `si` is not 'T', then `m` has `i` appended to it. `n` remains unchanged, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `arr` is a list of zeros, and `i` is 3.**
