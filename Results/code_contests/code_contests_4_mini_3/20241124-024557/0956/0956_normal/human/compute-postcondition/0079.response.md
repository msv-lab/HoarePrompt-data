According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `t`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(t) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has a length of at least 3 after popping, which means `len(t)` is at least 3. Therefore, `len(t) // 2` would be at least 1 (since 3 // 2 equals 1). This means that the current value of `i` must be less than `len(t) // 2` for the loop to execute again.

To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value, which means `i` should be 1 if it was 0 in the last iteration. Consequently, for the loop to execute again, `len(t)` must be at least 4 (because if `len(t)` is 4, `len(t) // 2` would be 2, allowing `i` to take the value 1). 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `len(t)` must be at least 4.
- `i` should be incremented to 1.

State: **`t` has length at least 4 after popping, `m` has been modified, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `arr[3]` is assigned the value of the first element from `m`, `i` is 1**
