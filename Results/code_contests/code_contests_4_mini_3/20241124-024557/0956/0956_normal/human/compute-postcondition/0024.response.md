Postcondition: ***`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or a space, `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, `file` is flushed; otherwise, `file` remains unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
