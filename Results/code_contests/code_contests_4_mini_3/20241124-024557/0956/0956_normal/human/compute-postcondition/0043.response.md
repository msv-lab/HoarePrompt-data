Output State: **If both `t` and `m` are empty, the loop does not execute and `t` remains a deque with 0 elements, `m` remains a deque with 0 elements, `arr` remains an empty list, and `i` is never defined. If `t` has at least one element and `m` is empty, an error occurs due to attempting to pop from an empty deque. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `arr`, attempting to evaluate `poss &= i < t.popleft()`. After the loop, `t` will have fewer elements (equal to the number of iterations executed), `m` will remain a deque with 0 elements, `arr` will be unchanged, and `i` will be the last element processed from `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute and the state remains the same as before.**
