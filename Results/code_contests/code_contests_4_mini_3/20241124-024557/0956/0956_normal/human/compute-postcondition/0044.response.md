Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque with 0 elements, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, and `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is true. If `poss` is true, the loop does not execute as both `t` and `m` remain empty, and `arr` remains an empty list. If `t` has at least one element and `m` is empty, an error occurs due to attempting to pop from an empty deque. If the loop executes, `poss` will be updated based on the comparisons between the elements popped from `t` and `m`, resulting in `t` having fewer elements equal to the number of iterations executed, while `m` remains unchanged and `arr` will contain the elements that were popped from `m`. In all cases, if `arr` is empty, the state remains unchanged after the if block executes.***
