The statement `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates the value of `poss` based on the comparison of `i` and the value popped from `t`. The operation involves two main actions:

1. A value is removed from the left side of the deque `t` using `t.popleft()`. The specific value that is popped is not known since the state of `t` is not provided, but we know that `t` has at least one element.

2. The comparison `i < t.popleft()` is evaluated. The result of this comparison (either `True` or `False`) will be combined with the current value of `poss` using the bitwise AND assignment operator `&=`. This means that if `poss` was `True`, it will remain `True` only if the comparison `i < t.popleft()` is also `True`. If `poss` was `False`, it will remain `False` regardless of the comparison result.

The values of `t`, `m`, `arr`, and `i` are affected as follows:
- `t` now has one less element.
- `arr` and `m` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `poss` will depend on its previous value and the result of the comparison.

Therefore, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`t` is a deque with at least one less element, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the value popped from `t`.**
