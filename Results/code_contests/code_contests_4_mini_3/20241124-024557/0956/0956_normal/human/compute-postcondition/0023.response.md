The `file.flush()` method is called, which flushes the internal buffer of the `file` object if it is writable. This means that any data that has been buffered for output is immediately written to the underlying file or stream. The values of `sep`, `at_start`, `args`, and the contents of `file` remain unchanged by this operation, and no variables are modified. 

Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file` remains unchanged after flushing.
