The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It processes test cases where for each test case, it handles an integer `n` that is divisible by 3 and lies within the range of 3 to just under 100,000, and a string consisting of exactly `n` characters that are either 'T' or 'M'. The function will return a result based on the analysis of the string and the integer `n` for each test case. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to process multiple test cases defined by an integer `n` and a string of characters, and return results based on the provided constraints. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and processes multiple test cases based on an integer n (divisible by 3) and a string of n characters ('T' or 'M'), returning results according to the analysis of these inputs.**
