Output State: **`sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`; `file` is modified to write the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`.**
