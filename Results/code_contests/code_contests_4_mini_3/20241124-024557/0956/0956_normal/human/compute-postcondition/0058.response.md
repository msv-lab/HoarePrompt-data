Output State: **`t` now contains 1 (after appending `i`), `m` remains unchanged, `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is still false, `poss` is true, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `si` is the second character of `s` (if it exists) or the first character of `s` (if `s` has only one character).**
