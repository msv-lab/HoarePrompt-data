The value of `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`. The `t.popleft()` operation removes and returns the first element of the deque `t`. The previous value of `poss` is updated with this new condition. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains at least 2 elements, `m` has sufficient elements to populate `arr`, `len(t)` is greater than or equal to 2, `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`.

Output State: **`arr` contains at least 2 elements, `m` has sufficient elements to populate `arr`, `len(t)` is greater than or equal to 2, `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
