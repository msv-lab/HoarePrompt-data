According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element of `args`, and since `args` is a non-empty iterable, we can deduce that there are more elements left after the current `x`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in `args`. Since `x` is currently the first element, we will need to set `x` to the second element of `args`. Additionally, `at_start` should be set to `False` since the loop is no longer at the start.

State: **`sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the second element of `args`, and `file` now contains the string representation of `x`**
