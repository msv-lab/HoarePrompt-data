`i` is appended to the deque `t`, and since `i` is 0, the deque `t` will now contain one element which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is false, `poss` is true, the function returns 'YES', `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `si` is 'T'.
Output State: **`t` is a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is false, `poss` is true, the function returns 'YES', `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `si` is 'T'**
