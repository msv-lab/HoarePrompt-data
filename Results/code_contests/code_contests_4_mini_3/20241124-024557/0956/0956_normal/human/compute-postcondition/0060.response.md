Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques that may contain 0 based on the first character of `s`. If the second character of `s` (or the first if `s` has only one character) is 'T', then `t` contains the value 1 appended to it, while `m` remains unchanged, and the condition `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` remains false. If the second character is not 'T', then `m` contains the value 1 appended to it, while `t` remains unchanged, and the condition `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` remains false. In both cases, `poss` is true, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `si` reflects the second character of `s` if it exists or the first character if `s` has only one character.***
