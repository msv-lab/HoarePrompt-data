According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` has a length of at least 1 after popleft. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `t` must be at least 2, and `i` should be updated to 1.

State: **`t` has a length of at least 2 after popleft, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` now contains the first element of `m` at index `i`, `i` is 1, and the value of `poss` is updated based on the comparison.**
