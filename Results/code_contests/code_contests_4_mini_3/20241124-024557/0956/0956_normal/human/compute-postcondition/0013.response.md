The value of `at_start` is being assigned `False`, but since it was already False in the initial state, there is no change in its value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the second element of `args`.
