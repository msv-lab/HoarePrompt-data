Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`. The condition `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` remains false throughout the loop execution. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `t` and `m` remain empty. If `s` contains only 'T' characters, `m` remains empty, and if `s` contains only non-'T' characters, `t` remains empty. In all cases, `poss` is true, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a non-empty string or empty string depending on the case.**
