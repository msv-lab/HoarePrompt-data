Output State: **`sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True, `file` remains unchanged, and `sep` is still either the value from kwargs or a space.**
