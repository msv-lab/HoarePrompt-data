Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T' and has 1 appended if `si` is 'T'; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. `m` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T' and has 1 appended if `si` is not 'T'; otherwise, `m` remains unchanged. `n` remains unchanged, `s` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a list of zeros, `i` is 1, and `si` is the second character of `s`.***
