Postcondition: ***`t`, `m`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `poss` is true and the length of `t` is at least 2, then `poss` will be updated based on the comparisons between elements of `arr` and elements removed from `t`. After the loop, `arr` will contain at least 0 elements, and `t` will have a length of at least `len(t) - len(arr)`. If the length of `t` is less than 2, `t`, `m`, and `poss` remain unchanged, and `arr` remains a list of zeros.***
