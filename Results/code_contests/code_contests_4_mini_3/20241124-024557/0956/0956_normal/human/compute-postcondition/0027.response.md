The code attempts to assign the first element of deque `m` to `arr[i]`. However, `m` is a deque with 0 elements. This means that attempting to perform `m.popleft()` will result in an error since there are no elements to pop from `m`. The initial state of the variables is not changed by this operation due to the error.

Output State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 element left, `m` is a deque with 0 elements, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and an error occurs due to attempting to pop from an empty deque.**
