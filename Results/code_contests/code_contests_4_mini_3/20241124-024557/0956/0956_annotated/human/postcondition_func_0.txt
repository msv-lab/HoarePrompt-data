The function accepts an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of 'T' and 'M'. It checks if the number of 'M's is half the number of 'T's and if the indices of 'T's can be matched with the indices of 'M's based on their order. It then calls `func_2` with 'YES' if the conditions are met, or 'NO' if they are not. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not divisible by 3, nor does it check for the validity of `n` beyond ensuring that the logic inside works correctly for the provided string.
