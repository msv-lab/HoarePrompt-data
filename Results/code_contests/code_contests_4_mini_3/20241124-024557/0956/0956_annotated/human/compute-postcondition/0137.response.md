Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of all occurrences of 'T' in `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all occurrences of 'M' in `s`, `poss` indicates whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, if `poss` is true, `func_2` is called with 'YES', otherwise it is called with 'NO'. If `t` is empty or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute its inner logic and `poss` will be determined based on the lengths of `t` and `m`. If `len(m) * 2` is not equal to `len(t)`, `poss` will be false and the function will return 'NO'.**
