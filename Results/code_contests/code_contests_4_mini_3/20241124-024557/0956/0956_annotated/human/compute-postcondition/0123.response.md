The code assigns the value from `m.popleft()` to `arr[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means that the value at index 1 of `arr` is updated with the value that is removed from the front of the deque `m`. The initial state mentions that `m` is unchanged, which suggests that it is a deque containing at least one element. The states of the other variables (`t`, `poss`, `n`, `s`) are not directly affected, but `arr` is updated at index 1.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value in `arr` at index 2.

Output State: **`t` has at least 4 elements remaining, `m` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, and `arr` is updated at index 2 with the value from `m`.**
