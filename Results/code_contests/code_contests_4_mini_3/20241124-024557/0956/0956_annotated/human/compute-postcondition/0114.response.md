The variable `arr` is assigned a list of zeros with a length equal to half the length of `t`. Since `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', the length of `t` can be derived from its contents. The calculation for the length of `arr` is `len(t) // 2`, which means `arr` will hold zeros for half the number of 'T' indices. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque with indices of 'T', `m` is a deque with indices not 'T', `poss` is true, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 0, and `arr` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(t) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a deque with indices of 'T', `m` is a deque with indices not 'T', `poss` is true, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 0, and `arr` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(t) // 2`**
