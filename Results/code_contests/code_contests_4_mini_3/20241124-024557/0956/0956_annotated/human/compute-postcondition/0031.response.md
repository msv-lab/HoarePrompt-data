According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(t) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `len(t)` must be at least 6, since `len(t) // 2` must be greater than `i`, which is currently 1.

Since `t` has been modified in the previous iteration by popping its first element, we need to adjust the state of `t` to reflect that it still has enough elements to allow for another iteration. Therefore, `len(t)` needs to be at least 6.

State: **`t` is a list with at least 6 elements, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` is a list with the first element updated to the popped value from `m`, `i` is 1, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison**
