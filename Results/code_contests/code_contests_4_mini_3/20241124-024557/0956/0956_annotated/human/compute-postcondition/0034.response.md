According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `t`. The loop iterates `len(t) // 2` times, so for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `t` must be at least 8 (since it needs to allow for at least 4 iterations, and currently, `t` has at least 6 elements). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which indicates that the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Now, since `t` has at least 6 elements, and we want it to allow for another iteration, we can adjust our state to ensure `t` has at least 8 elements.

State: **`t` is a list with at least 8 elements, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` is a list with the first element updated to the popped value from `m`, `i` is 2, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]`, and `arr[1]` is assigned the popped value from `m`.**
