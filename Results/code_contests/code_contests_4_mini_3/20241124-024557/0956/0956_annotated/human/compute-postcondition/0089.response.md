Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of all occurrences of 'T' in `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all other characters in `s`, and `poss` is a boolean indicating whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`. If `poss` is true, then `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the condition that each element in `arr` is less than the corresponding elements popped from `t`, and both `t` and `m` are reduced accordingly. If `len(t)` is 0, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `poss` remains unchanged, and both `t` and `m` are unchanged. If `poss` is false at the beginning, no changes are made to `arr`, `t`, or `m`.***
