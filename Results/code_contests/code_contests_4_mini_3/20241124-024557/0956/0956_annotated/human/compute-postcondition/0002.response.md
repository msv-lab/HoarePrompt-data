The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `sep`, and `file`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3; the string consists of exactly `n` characters, all of which are either 'T' or 'M'; the total length of strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `sep` is assigned the default value ' '; `file` is assigned the default value sys.stdout; `at_start` is True.
