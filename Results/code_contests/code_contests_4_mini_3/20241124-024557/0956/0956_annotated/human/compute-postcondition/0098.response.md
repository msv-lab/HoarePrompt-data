The code appends the value of `i` to the deque `t`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `t` will now contain the single element `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` contains 0, `m` is an empty deque, `poss` indicates whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'.

Output State: **`t` contains 0, `m` is an empty deque, `poss` indicates whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'**
