The operation `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates the value of `poss`. The `t.popleft()` method removes and returns the leftmost element from the deque `t`. The expression `i < t.popleft()` evaluates to either `True` or `False` based on the comparison between `i` and the value returned from `t.popleft()`. The `&=` operator then updates `poss` to be the logical AND of its current value and the result of the comparison.

Since the variables `t` and `m` remain unchanged and we're not provided with specific values for `i`, `t`, or `poss`, we can express the output state in terms of their relationships.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated to `poss & (i < t.popleft())`, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements**.
