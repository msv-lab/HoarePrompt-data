Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques containing indices of 'T' and 'M' characters, respectively. If the length of `t` is at least 2 and `poss` is true, `arr` is populated with indices from `m` while checking if elements in `arr` are less than corresponding elements removed from `t`. The variable `poss` reflects whether the comparisons were successful. If `len(t)` is less than 2, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `m` remains unchanged, and `poss` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `len(t)` is less than or equal to the length of `arr`, not all comparisons may occur, and `poss` is based on the number of comparisons made.***
