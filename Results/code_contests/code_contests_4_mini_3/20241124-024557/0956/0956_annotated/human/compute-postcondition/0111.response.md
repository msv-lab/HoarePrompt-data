Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `poss` indicates whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` remains an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `i` represents the current index in the string `s`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, resulting in both `t` and `m` being empty deques, `poss` being false, `n` remaining unchanged, and `i` being 0.**
