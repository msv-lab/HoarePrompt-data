The value of `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element of `t`. The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates `poss` based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t`. This means `poss` is combined with the result of the comparison (`True` or `False`), thus potentially altering its value. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, apart from the removal of the first element from `t`.

Output State: **`arr` has at least 1 element, `len(t)` is greater than 0, `poss` is updated based on `i < t.popleft()`, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
