The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates the value of `poss`. It performs a logical AND operation between the current value of `poss` and the result of the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. The `t.popleft()` operation removes and returns the first element of the deque `t`, and since `len(t)` is greater than 0, this operation succeeds.

The previous value of `i` is the second element of `arr`, and `t.popleft()` will yield a value from `t`, which affects the comparison. 

The output state will reflect the updated state of `poss` based on the logical operation. Since `poss` is updated but other variables remain unchanged, the output state will include the new value of `poss`, which is dependent on the comparison.

Output State: **`arr` has at least 2 elements, `len(t)` is greater than 0, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `i` is the second element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on `i < t.popleft()`**.
