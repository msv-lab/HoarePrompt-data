The `append` method is called on the deque `m`, adding the current value of `i` (which is 0) to it. The previous state of `m` is empty, so after execution, `m` will contain the single element 0. The values of `t`, `poss`, `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `poss` indicates whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `poss` indicates whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 0**
