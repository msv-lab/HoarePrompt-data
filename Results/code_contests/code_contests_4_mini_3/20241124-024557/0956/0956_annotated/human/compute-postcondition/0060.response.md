Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques. If the second character of `s` (denoted as `si`) is 'T', then `i` (which is 1) is appended to `t`, and `t` contains 0 as its first element. `m` remains unchanged. If `si` is not 'T', then `i` is appended to `m`, making `m` contain 1, and `t` remains unchanged. In both cases, `poss` remains true or false, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `s` does not affect the outcome of the operations on `t` and `m`.***
