Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T', otherwise `t` is an empty deque. `m` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T', otherwise `m` is an empty deque. `poss` remains true or false, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, and `si` is the first character in `s`.***
