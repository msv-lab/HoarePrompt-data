`i` is appended to the deque `t`. The value of `i` is currently 0, so after execution, `t` will contain the value 0. The other variables (`m`, `poss`, `n`, `s`, `si`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` contains 0, `m` is an empty deque, `poss` is true or false, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` (`si`) is equal to 'T'.

Output State: **`t` contains 0, `m` is an empty deque, `poss` is true or false, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, and `si` is 'T'**
