Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of all occurrences of 'T' in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all other characters in `s`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `t` and `m` remain empty deques. `poss` remains true or false, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string which may be empty.**
