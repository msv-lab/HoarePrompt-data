According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a deque containing indices of 'T' characters. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is unmodified and still contains its initial elements, and the loop is based on its length.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the state of `t`. Since the loop is iterating over `t` and if it has at least one index remaining, it can execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must contain at least one element (which means `t` is not empty).

Since there is no indication that `t` has been modified, its state remains the same. Consequently, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must have at least one index.

State: **`t` is a deque containing at least one index, `m` is a deque containing indices of 'M' characters, `poss` is true or false**
