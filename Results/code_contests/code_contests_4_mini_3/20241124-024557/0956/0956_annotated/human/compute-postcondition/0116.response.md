The code modifies the variable `poss` by performing a logical AND operation with the result of the expression `t.popleft() < m[0]`. The `popleft()` method removes and returns the leftmost element from the deque `t`, and since `t` has at least 2 indices, it will successfully remove the first element. The comparison checks if this removed element is less than the first element of deque `m`.

The state of `poss` will depend on the result of this comparison. If the condition is true, `poss` remains true; if it is false, `poss` will become false. The values of `n`, `s`, `i`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state should reflect the updated value of `poss` based on the comparison, along with the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 index left, `m` is a deque with indices not 'T', `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(t) // 2`**
