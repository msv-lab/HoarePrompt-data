According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `arr` has at least 2 elements, meaning there may be more elements available. Since `i` is the second element of `arr`, for the loop to execute once more, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr`.

Therefore, the adjusted states should reflect that `arr` has at least 3 elements, and `i` should be the third element of `arr`. 

State: **`arr` has at least 3 elements, `len(t)` is greater than 0, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `i` is the third element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on `i < t.popleft()`**
