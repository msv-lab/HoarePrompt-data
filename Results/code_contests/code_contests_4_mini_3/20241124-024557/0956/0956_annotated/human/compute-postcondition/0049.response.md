The code initializes `t` as an empty deque. The previous state of `t` contained at least one index, but after executing `t = deque()`, `t` is now empty. The values of `m`, `poss`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` is now empty while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is a deque containing indices of 'M' characters, `poss` is true or false, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**
