The `file.write(sep)` method call writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The initial state indicates that `file` contains a string representation of the next `x` followed by `sep`, and `at_start` is `False`. The value of `sep` is not specified, but it is written to the `file`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`file` contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by `sep`, and `at_start` is False; `sep` is written to the `file`.**
