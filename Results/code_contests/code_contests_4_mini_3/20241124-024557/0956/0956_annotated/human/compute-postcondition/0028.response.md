According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the deque `t`. The loop can execute while `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` contains at least 1 index. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `t` must be at least 4 (since `len(t) // 2` must be greater than `i`, which is 0).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows: `len(t)` needs to be at least 4, and since `i` is currently 0, it will increase to 1 in the next iteration. 

State: **`t` is a deque containing at least 4 indices, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` is a list with the first element updated to the popped value from `m`, `i` is 1, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison.**
