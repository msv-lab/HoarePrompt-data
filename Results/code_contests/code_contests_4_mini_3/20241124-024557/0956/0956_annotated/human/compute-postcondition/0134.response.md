Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques containing indices of characters in `s` that are 'T' and not 'T', respectively. If `poss` is true, `arr` is a list containing the first half of the indices from `m`, and `poss` is updated based on comparisons between these indices and values popped from `t`. The integer `n` remains unchanged, the string `s` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to the last element processed in `arr`. If the length of `t` is odd, the loop does not execute, and `poss` remains unchanged.***
