The expression `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]` updates the value of `poss`. The operation involves the following steps:

1. `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`. Let's denote this value as `t_val`.
2. `m[0]` refers to the first element of the list `m`.
3. The expression `t_val < m[0]` evaluates to a boolean value (True or False).
4. The `&=` operator updates `poss` by performing a bitwise AND with the current value of `poss` and the result of the comparison `t_val < m[0]`.

Since `t` has at least 4 elements, `t_val` will successfully retrieve the first element without causing an error. The value of `poss` will depend on its previous value and the result of the comparison.

Assuming `poss` was previously a boolean value, letâ€™s denote the previous value of `poss` as `poss_prev`. After the operation, `poss` can either remain True or become False based on the comparison's result.

Other variables `arr`, `n`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is updated with the first element of `m`, `t` has at least 3 elements remaining, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1**
