The code `t.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the deque `t`. Since `i` is 2, the deque `t` which initially contains 0 will now contain 0 and 2. The variables `m` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque with 0 and 2, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2, and `s` is a string with at least 3 characters.

Output State: **`t` is a deque with 0 and 2, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters**
