The code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. However, the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so it is unknown. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state focuses on the action of writing to `file`.

Output State: **`file` has the string representation of `x` written to it, but the value of `x` is unknown**.
