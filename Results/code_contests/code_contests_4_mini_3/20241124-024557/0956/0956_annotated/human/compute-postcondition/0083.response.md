According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element of `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` should be updated to the second element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` has at least 2 elements, `len(t)` is greater than 0, `poss` is updated based on `i < t.popleft()`, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `i` is the second element of `arr`**
