According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `arr` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element of `arr`, which means the loop has already iterated over the first two elements. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, there are still more elements for the loop to iterate through.

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in the list, which would be the fourth element of `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` should be updated accordingly.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated to `poss & (i < t.popleft())`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements**
