The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3. The parameter `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer t representing the number of test cases, an integer n that is divisible by 3 and within the specified range, and a string s of length n consisting of 'T' and 'M'.**
