According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` list. The loop iterates over each element in `arr`, so for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `arr` that has not yet been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and since `arr` has at least 1 element, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` should now be the next element in `arr`.

If `arr` has more than 1 element, then `i` needs to be set to the second element in the list, and the length of `arr` should reflect that it contains at least 2 elements to ensure the loop can continue. 

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated to `poss & (i < t.popleft())`, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements**
