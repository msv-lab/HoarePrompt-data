According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the array `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must contain at least one more element than the current iteration, and `i` should take on the next value from `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 3 elements. Assuming the loop has iterated through at least one element already, let's denote that the current value of `i` is the last element accessed in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` should be the next element in `arr`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `arr` has at least 4 elements. 

State: **`arr` contains at least 4 elements, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
