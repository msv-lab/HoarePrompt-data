The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. Parameter `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and parameter `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n < 10^5 and is divisible by 3. Additionally, there is a string associated with the parameter `n`, which consists of exactly `n` characters, all of which are either 'T' or 'M'. The total length of strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function processes these inputs but does not return a value explicitly described in the provided output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept these parameters and presumably perform some operations based on them, although the exact output or return value is not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t (a positive integer between 1 and 5000) and a parameter n (an integer between 3 and less than 100000 that is divisible by 3), along with a string of exactly n characters consisting of 'T' and 'M'.**
