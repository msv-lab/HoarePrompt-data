Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sep` is ' ', `file` is assigned the default value sys.stdout, and if `at_start` is False, a space is written to `file`. If `at_start` is True, no changes are made to `file`.***
