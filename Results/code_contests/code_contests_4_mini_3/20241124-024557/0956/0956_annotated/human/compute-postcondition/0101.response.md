Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that may contain `i` (which is 0) if the first character of `s` (`si`) is 'T'; otherwise, `m` is a deque that contains `i` (0). The variable `poss` still indicates whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, maintaining the relationship between the lengths of `m` and `t` after the execution of the program fragment. Additionally, `n` remains an input integer, `s` remains a string with at least 1 character, and `i` is still 0.***
