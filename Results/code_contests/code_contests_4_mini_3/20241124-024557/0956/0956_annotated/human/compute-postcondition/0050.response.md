The code reassigns `m` to a new empty `deque()`, which means the previous contents of `m` are discarded. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` is now an empty deque, `poss` is true or false, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is now an empty deque, `poss` is true or false, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**
