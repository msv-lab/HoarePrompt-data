The code updates the variable `poss` based on the comparison of `i` and the result of `t.popleft()`. The `popleft()` method removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`. The value of `i` is taken from the third element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated using a bitwise AND with the result of the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. 

Since `len(t)` is greater than 0, `t.popleft()` will successfully return the first element of `t`, which affects the outcome of the comparison. The exact values of `i` and the first element of `t` are not provided, but the comparison will yield either `True` or `False`, updating `poss` accordingly.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated `poss` value based on the comparison, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` has at least 3 elements, `len(t)` is greater than 0, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `i` is the third element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on `i < t.popleft()`**
