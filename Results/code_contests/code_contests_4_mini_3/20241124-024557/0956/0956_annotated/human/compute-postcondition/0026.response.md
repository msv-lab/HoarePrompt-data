Functionality: ** The function accepts variable positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the elements in `args` to a specified output stream (`file`), separating them with a specified separator (`sep`). It also appends an ending character to the output and may flush the output stream based on the `flush` keyword argument. If `args` is empty, it writes only the ending character to the output. If the `flush` argument is set to True, the output stream is flushed after writing. The function does not validate the contents of `args` or `kwargs`, and there is no handling for edge cases such as invalid types or empty inputs.**
