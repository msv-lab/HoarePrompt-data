According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `arr`. After the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `arr`, meaning that the first element has already been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be updated to the third element of `arr`.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated to `poss & (i < t.popleft())`, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements**
