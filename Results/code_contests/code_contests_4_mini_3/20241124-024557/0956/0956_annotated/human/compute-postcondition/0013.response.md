The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The initial state of the variable `file` remains unchanged as the assignment does not affect it directly. Therefore, the output state is: `file` contains the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`; `at_start` is `False`.

Output State: **`file` contains the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`; `at_start` is `False`**
