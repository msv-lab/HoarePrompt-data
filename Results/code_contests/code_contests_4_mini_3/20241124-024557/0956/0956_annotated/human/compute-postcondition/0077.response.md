The expression `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]` impacts the state as follows:

1. The method `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element of the deque `t`. This modifies the deque `t`, reducing its size by one.
2. The result of the comparison `t.popleft() < m[0]` is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on whether the popped element is less than the first element of the list `m`.
3. The operator `&=` updates the variable `poss` by performing a bitwise AND operation between its current value and the result of the comparison.

Since `arr`, `m`, `n`, `s`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation, we only need to consider the changes to `t` and `poss`.

The output state will reflect that `poss` is updated based on the comparison and `t` has one less element.

Output State: **`arr` is updated with the first element of `m` at index 1, `t` has at least 3 elements remaining, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2**.
