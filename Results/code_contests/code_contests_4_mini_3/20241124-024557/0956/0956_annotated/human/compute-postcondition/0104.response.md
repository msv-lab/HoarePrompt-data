The value of `i` is appended to the deque `m`. The initial state indicates that `m` contains 0, and since `i` is 1, after executing the code, `m` will contain 0 and 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque that may contain 0, `m` contains 0 and 1, `poss` indicates that `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` remains an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is a deque that may contain 0, `m` contains 0 and 1, `poss` indicates that `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` remains an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is 1**
