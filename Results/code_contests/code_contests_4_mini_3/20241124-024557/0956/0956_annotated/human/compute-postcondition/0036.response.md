According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element. 

If `len(t)` is at least 2, then `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`. Therefore, `arr` must have at least one element, which implies that `len(t)` must be at least 2 (since `len(t) // 2` must be greater than or equal to 1).

If `len(t)` is less than 2, `arr` is a list of zeros, which will also allow the loop to execute, but it will not perform any iterations as it would be empty.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm that `arr` is non-empty. Thus, we can specify that `len(t)` must be at least 2 or `arr` must contain at least one element. 

Given that `m` remains unchanged, and `poss` reflects the results of all comparisons made during the loop, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`arr` contains at least 1 element, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` remains unchanged, `len(t)` is greater than or equal to 2 or `arr` is non-empty**
