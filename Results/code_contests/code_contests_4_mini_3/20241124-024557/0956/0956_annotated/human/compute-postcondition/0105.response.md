Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that may contain 0 and if the first character of `s` is 'T', then `i` (1) is appended to `t`, resulting in `t` containing all previous elements plus 1. If the first character of `s` is not 'T', then `m` is a deque containing 0 and 1, while `t` remains unchanged. In both cases, `poss` indicates that `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` remains an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is 1.***
