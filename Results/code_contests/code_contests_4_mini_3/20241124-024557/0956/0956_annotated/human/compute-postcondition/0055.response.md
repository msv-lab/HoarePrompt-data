The code `m.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the deque `m`. Since `i` is initialized to 0, the value being appended to `m` is 0. The variable `m` was initially empty, so after the execution, `m` will contain the single element 0. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `poss` is true or false, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0**
