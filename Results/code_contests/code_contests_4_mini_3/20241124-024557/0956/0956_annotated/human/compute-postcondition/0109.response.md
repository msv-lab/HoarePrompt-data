Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that may contain 0, possibly 1, and 2; `m` is a deque containing 0 and 1, and if `s[i]` is 'T', the value 2 is appended to `t`. If `s[i]` is not 'T', the value 2 is appended to `m`. In both cases, `poss` indicates that `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` remains an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is 2.***
