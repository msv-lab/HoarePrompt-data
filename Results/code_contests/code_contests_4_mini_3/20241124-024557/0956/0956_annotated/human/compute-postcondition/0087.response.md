According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` variable. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 3 elements, and `i` is the third element of `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `arr` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it will have at least 4 elements, and since `i` is assigned the current element from `arr`, it should change to the fourth element of `arr`. 

Additionally, `len(t)` is greater than 0, which means the `popleft()` method can still be called, so we should maintain that condition. The variable `m` is reduced, but we do not have to adjust it as it does not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`arr` has at least 4 elements, `len(t)` is greater than 0, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on `i < t.popleft()`**
