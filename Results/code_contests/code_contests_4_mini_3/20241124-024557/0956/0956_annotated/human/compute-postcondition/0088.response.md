Output State: **If `len(t)` is greater than 0, `poss` is the result of `poss` ANDed with the comparison of each element in `arr` with the elements popped from `t`, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, `len(t)` is decremented by the same amount, and `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`. If `len(t) == 0`, the loop does not execute, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `poss` stays true, and both `t` and `m` are unchanged.**
