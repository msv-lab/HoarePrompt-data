The value of `poss` is updated based on the condition that the first element popped from the deque `t` is less than the first element of the list `m`. The operation `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element of `t`. The value of `poss` is then modified with the bitwise AND operation against the result of the comparison. The other variables `m`, `arr`, `i` remain unchanged.

Since `t` contains at least 4 indices, `t.popleft()` will successfully return the first element of `t`. The state of `m`, `arr`, and `i` does not change.

Output State: **`t` is modified by popping its first element, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` is a list with the first element updated to the popped value from `m`, `i` is 1, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison.**
