Postcondition: ***If `args` contains at least one element, `file` remains unchanged, `at_start` is `False`, and the specified end character in `kwargs` is written to `file` and the file is flushed. If `args` is empty, `file` remains unchanged, `at_start` is `True`, and if the flush parameter in `kwargs` is set to True, the file is flushed, otherwise no flush occurs.***
