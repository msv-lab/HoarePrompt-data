According to the code, the loop iterates over the `t` deque, which contains indices of characters in `s` that are 'T'. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must contain at least one more index. Since `t` and `m` are deques, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop can be executed again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains indices of 'T'. Therefore, to allow one more execution of the loop, `t` must be adjusted to contain at least one additional index (i.e., it must have one more index than it did at the end of the previous iteration).

Given that the loop will execute `t` times, if `t` was previously not empty and had `n` elements, it should now have `n + 1` elements to allow for another iteration.

State: **`t` is a deque containing indices of characters in `s` that are 'T' with at least one additional index, `m` is unchanged, `poss` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged**.
