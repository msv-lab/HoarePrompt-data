According to the code, the loop will execute once for each element in `arr`. Since `arr` contains at least 2 elements, we need to determine how many elements are left for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements remaining. The variable `i` would take on the next element from `arr`, so if it has at least 2 elements, `i` will be assigned the next element in the next iteration, which means its value will be the third element in the list.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `m` remains unchanged and `poss` is updated based on the condition which is not relevant to the execution of the loop.

State: **`arr` contains at least 3 elements, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
