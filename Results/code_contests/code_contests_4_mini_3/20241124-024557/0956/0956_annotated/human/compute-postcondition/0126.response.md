According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. Since `arr` is currently an empty list, the loop will not execute. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. Additionally, since `i` is used to iterate over `arr`, it should be adjusted to the first element of `arr` after it is populated. 

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is true, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `i` is the first element of `arr` (after it is populated), `arr` is a list with at least 1 element**
