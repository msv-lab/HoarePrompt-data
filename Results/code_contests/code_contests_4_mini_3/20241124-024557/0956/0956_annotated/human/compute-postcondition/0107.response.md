The code `t.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the deque `t`. The state of `m`, `poss`, `n`, and `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated contents of `t` after appending `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing 0, possibly 1, and 2; `m` is a deque containing 0 and 1; `poss` indicates that `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`; `n` remains an input integer; `s` is a string with at least 2 characters; `i` is 2**
