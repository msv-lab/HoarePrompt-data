Output State: **`t` is a deque that may contain 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T'; otherwise, `m` is a deque that contains 0, `poss` indicates that `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, `n` remains an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, and `t` now contains the previous elements plus `i` (1).**
