The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. Since `sep` is assigned the default value of a space (' '), this means that a space is written to `file`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sep` is ' ', `file` is assigned the default value sys.stdout, and `at_start` is False. A space has been written to `file`.
