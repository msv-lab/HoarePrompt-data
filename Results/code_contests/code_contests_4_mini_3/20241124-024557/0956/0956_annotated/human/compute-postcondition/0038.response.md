According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. Since `arr` contains at least 1 element, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to the current element from `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. Since `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`, we need to ensure that `i` is updated to the next element in `arr` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must contain at least 2 elements.
- `i` should point to the next element in the `arr`.

State: **`arr` contains at least 2 elements, `m` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
