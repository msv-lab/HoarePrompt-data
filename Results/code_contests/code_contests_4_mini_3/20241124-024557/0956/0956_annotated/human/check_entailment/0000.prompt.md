You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The student council has a shared document file. Every day, some members of the student council write the sequence TMT (short for Towa Maji Tenshi) in it.

However, one day, the members somehow entered the sequence into the document at the same time, creating a jumbled mess. Therefore, it is Suguru Doujima's task to figure out whether the document has malfunctioned. Specifically, he is given a string of length n whose characters are all either T or M, and he wants to figure out if it is possible to partition it into some number of disjoint subsequences, all of which are equal to TMT. That is, each character of the string should belong to exactly one of the subsequences.

A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (3 ≤ n < 10^5), the number of characters in the string entered in the document. It is guaranteed that n is divisible by 3.

The second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of only the characters T and M.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing YES if the described partition exists, and a single line containing NO otherwise.

Example

Input


5
3
TMT
3
MTT
6
TMTMTT
6
TMTTTT
6
TTMMTT


Output


YES
NO
YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, the string itself is already a sequence equal to TMT.

In the third test case, we may partition the string into the subsequences TMTMTT. Both the bolded and the non-bolded subsequences are equal to TMT.
Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        t = deque()
        
        m = deque()
        
        for i, si in enumerate(s):
            if si == 'T':
                t.append(i)
            else:
                m.append(i)
        
        poss = len(m) * 2 == len(t)
        
        if poss:
            arr = [0] * (len(t) // 2)
            for i in range(len(t) // 2):
                poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]
                arr[i] = m.popleft()
            for i in arr:
                poss &= i < t.popleft()
        
        func_2('YES' if poss else 'NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a deque containing the indices of all occurrences of 'T' in `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all occurrences of 'M' in `s`, `poss` indicates whether `len(m) * 2` equals `len(t)`, if `poss` is true, `func_2` is called with 'YES', otherwise it is called with 'NO'. If `t` is empty or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute its inner logic and `poss` will be determined based on the lengths of `t` and `m`. If `len(m) * 2` is not equal to `len(t)`, `poss` will be false and the function will return 'NO'.

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `args` contains at least one element, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is `False`. If `args` is empty, `file` remains unchanged, and `at_start` is `True`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `args` contains at least one element, `file` remains unchanged, `at_start` is `False`, and the specified end character in `kwargs` is written to `file` and the file is flushed. If `args` is empty, `file` remains unchanged, `at_start` is `True`, and if the flush parameter in `kwargs` is set to True, the file is flushed, otherwise no flush occurs.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
