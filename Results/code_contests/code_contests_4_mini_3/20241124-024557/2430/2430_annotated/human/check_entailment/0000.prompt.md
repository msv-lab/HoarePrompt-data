You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Now Fox Ciel becomes a commander of Tree Land. Tree Land, like its name said, has n cities connected by n - 1 undirected roads, and for any two cities there always exists a path between them.

Fox Ciel needs to assign an officer to each city. Each officer has a rank — a letter from 'A' to 'Z'. So there will be 26 different ranks, and 'A' is the topmost, so 'Z' is the bottommost.

There are enough officers of each rank. But there is a special rule must obey: if x and y are two distinct cities and their officers have the same rank, then on the simple path between x and y there must be a city z that has an officer with higher rank. The rule guarantee that a communications between same rank officers will be monitored by higher rank officer.

Help Ciel to make a valid plan, and if it's impossible, output "Impossible!".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of cities in Tree Land.

Each of the following n - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) — they mean that there will be an undirected road between a and b. Consider all the cities are numbered from 1 to n.

It guaranteed that the given graph will be a tree.

Output

If there is a valid plane, output n space-separated characters in a line — i-th character is the rank of officer in the city with number i. 

Otherwise output "Impossible!".

Examples

Input

4
1 2
1 3
1 4


Output

A B B B


Input

10
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10


Output

D C B A D C B D C D

Note

In the first example, for any two officers of rank 'B', an officer with rank 'A' will be on the path between them. So it is a valid solution.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(queue, n, nodes):
    HM = 2 * 26 - 1
    res = [0] * n
    while queue:
        cur = queue.pop(0)
        
        val = cur[1]
        
        ind = cur[0]
        
        res[ind] = val
        
        if val > HM:
            break
        
        val += 1
        
        for sosed in nodes[ind]:
            if res[sosed] == 0:
                queue.append([sosed, val])
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If `queue` is non-empty and the loop executes, `res[ind]` will be assigned a value of `val`. If `val` is greater than `HM` (51), the loop will terminate immediately after this assignment. If `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `val` will be incremented, and for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is 0, new pairs `[sosed, val]` will be appended to `queue`. If `queue` is empty before the loop starts, it will not execute, leaving `res` unchanged and remaining zeros. If all entries in `nodes[ind]` result in `res[sosed]` being non-zero, the loop will not execute, and `queue` will remain unchanged. At the end of the loop, if it executed, `queue` will be shorter depending on the number of valid `sosed` processed, `val` will be incremented by the number of iterations executed, and `res[ind]` will be updated with the last processed `val`. If `val` was modified before the loop and was greater than `HM`, the loop will not execute at all, and `queue` will remain unchanged.
    if (max(res) > HM) :
        return 'Impossible!'
        #The program returns 'Impossible!'
    else :
        for ind in xrange(len(res)):
            val = res[ind]
            
            if val > 26:
                res[ind] = 2 * 26 - val
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `res` is a list with at least one element, then after the loop, `res` will have been modified such that any element greater than 26 is replaced by `2 * 26 - val`, where `val` is that element. If `res` contains elements all less than or equal to 26, it remains unchanged. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged with all entries being 0. `ind` will be the index of the currently processed element, ranging from 0 to `len(res) - 1` during execution.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, if `res` contains elements, any element greater than 26 is replaced by `2 * 26 - val`, where `val` is that element. If all elements in `res` are less than or equal to 26, `res` remains unchanged. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged with all entries being 0. The final output is a string representation of the modified `res` list, where each element is converted to a corresponding character based on its value.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
