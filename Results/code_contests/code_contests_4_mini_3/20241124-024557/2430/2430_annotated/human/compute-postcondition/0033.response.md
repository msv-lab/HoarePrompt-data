Postcondition: ***`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and if `res[sosed]` was 0, the queue now contains the appended list [sosed, val]. If `res[sosed]` was not 0, the queue remains unchanged.***
