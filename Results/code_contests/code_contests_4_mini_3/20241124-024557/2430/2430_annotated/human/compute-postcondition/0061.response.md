Output State: **After the loop executes, `nodes[ind]` remains non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0 for each `sosed` processed, `cur` is the value previously at the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `queue` is shorter by the number of times the loop executed, and for each `sosed` where `res[sosed]` is 0, a new entry [sosed, val] is appended to `queue`. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `queue` unchanged. If all `res[sosed]` for elements in `nodes[ind]` are not 0, the loop does not execute, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
