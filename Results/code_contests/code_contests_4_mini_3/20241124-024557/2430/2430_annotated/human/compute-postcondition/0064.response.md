Postcondition: ***`queue` can be non-empty or empty, `res` is an array of integers. The maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM` (51). If `queue` is non-empty, `res[ind]` is assigned a value of `val` which is greater than `HM`, and the loop will not execute. If `queue` is empty, `res` remains unchanged.***
