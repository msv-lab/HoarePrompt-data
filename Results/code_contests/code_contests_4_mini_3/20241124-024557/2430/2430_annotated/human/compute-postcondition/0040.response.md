According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of the `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element after `sosed`, which means that there are more elements left to iterate over in the `nodes[ind]` list. The loop is currently processing `sosed`, which is the next element in the list after the one that was just processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the next element in `nodes[ind]` is available for iteration. Since `sosed` is assigned the next element after the current one, we need to adjust `sosed` to point to the next element in the list. Additionally, since the loop iterates through `nodes[ind]`, we need to increment the index of the current element being processed.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `sosed` should now be the next element after the current `sosed`.
- `ind` remains the same since it is assigned the value of `cur[0]` and does not change within the loop.

State: **`nodes[ind]` has at least one more element after the next `sosed`, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]` after the current one**
