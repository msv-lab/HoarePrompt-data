The code `queue.append([sosed, val])` adds a new element to the `queue`. The new element is a list containing `sosed` and `val`. The previous values of the affected variables are `sosed` (which is the next element in the iterable) and `val` (which is 52). The `queue` remains unchanged in terms of its previous content, but with the addition of the new element, its state will change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, `sosed` is the next element in the iterable, and `queue` now contains the new element [sosed, 52]**
