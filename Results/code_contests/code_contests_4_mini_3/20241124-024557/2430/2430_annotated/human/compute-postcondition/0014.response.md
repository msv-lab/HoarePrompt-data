According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `nodes[ind]`. If `nodes[ind]` contains more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty iterable, and for the loop to execute one more time, `sosed` needs to take on the next value from `nodes[ind]`.

Assuming `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element beyond the current `sosed`, the state should be adjusted accordingly. Since we do not have the specifics of the current `sosed`, we will denote it as the next element in the iterable.

Thus, the adjusted state must reflect that the loop can continue by ensuring that `nodes[ind]` still has elements left for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `val` is 52, and `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, `sosed` is the next element in the iterable, and `queue` remains unchanged**.
