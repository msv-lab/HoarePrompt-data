The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
