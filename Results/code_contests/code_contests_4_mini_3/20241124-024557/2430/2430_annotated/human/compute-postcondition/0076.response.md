The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. Here are the details of each parameter:

1. `queue`: This parameter is not explicitly described in the output but is likely related to the processing of the roads between cities.
2. `n`: This is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), representing the number of cities.
3. `nodes`: This parameter represents the pairs of integers (a, b) that denote the undirected roads between distinct cities.

After executing the function body, if the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the function returns the string 'Impossible!'. If `res` contains elements, any element greater than 26 is replaced by a specific formula, while elements less than or equal to 26 remain unchanged. If `res` is empty, it remains unchanged with all entries being 0. Finally, the function returns a string representation of the modified `res` list, where each element is converted to a corresponding character based on its value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`, and returns 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`. Otherwise, it modifies `res` based on specific conditions and returns a string representation of the modified `res` list.**
