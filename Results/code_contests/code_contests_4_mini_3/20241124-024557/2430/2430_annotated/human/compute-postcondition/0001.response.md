The code initializes a list `res` with `n` elements, all set to 0. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `res` will be a list containing `n` zeros. The value of `HM` remains unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `res` along with the unchanged state of `n` and `HM`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of `n` zeros**
