Postcondition: ***`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that no further processing occurs for this iteration. If `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, the program continues its execution beyond this point.***
