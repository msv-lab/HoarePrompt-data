The code appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to `queue`. The previous state indicates that `nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` has been assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` has been incremented by 1, `ind` has been assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`. Therefore, the `queue` will now include the new entry, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `sosed` is the next element in nodes[ind], and `queue` now contains an additional entry [sosed, val]**.
