The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The initial values indicate that `nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` has been assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` has been incremented by 1, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the operation performed.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `queue` now contains the appended list [sosed, val]**
