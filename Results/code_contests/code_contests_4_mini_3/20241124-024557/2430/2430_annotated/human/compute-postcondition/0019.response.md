Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `queue` is updated to include the pair `[sosed, 52]`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, `queue` remains unchanged.***
