The value of `val` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `val` is not specified, but it is known that `val` was previously assigned from `cur[1]`. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes[ind]` remains non-empty; `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`; `cur` is assigned the value previously at the front of `queue`; `val` is now incremented by 1; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`; `queue` is one element shorter; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val - 1`.
