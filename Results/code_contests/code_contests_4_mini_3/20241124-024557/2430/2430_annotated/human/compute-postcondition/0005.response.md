The variable `cur` is defined as the first element removed from `queue`, which is assumed to be a list or similar structure containing tuples or lists. The variable `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the first element of `cur`. The code then assigns `val` to the `ind`-th position of the list `res`. 

Since `res` is initially a list of `n` zeros, the specific index `ind` will have its value updated to `val`. Other variables such as `n`, `HM`, `cur`, and the remaining elements of `res` are not affected.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the list `res` at index `ind`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` has one value updated at index `ind` to `val`; `cur` is the first element removed from `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`**
