According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `res` list. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0 and `res` has at least 1 element, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `ind` must be incremented to 1, and it should still be less than the length of `res`, which will now be 1 in this case. Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute again would require `res` to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, and `val` is the second element of `res`**
