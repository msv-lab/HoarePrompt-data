The variable `val` is assigned the value of the element at index `ind` (which is 2) from the list `res`. Since `res` has at least 3 elements, `val` will take the value of the third element of `res`. The state of `queue` is not affected, and the values of `res` and `ind` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, and `val` is the third element of `res`.

Output State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, and `val` is the third element of `res`**
