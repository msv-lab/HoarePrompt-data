According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `sosed` and the list `nodes[ind]`. Since `nodes[ind]` has at least 3 elements at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute one more time. After the last iteration, `sosed` was the next element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `sosed` must be adjusted to the next element in the list, which means it should be the third element (if it has not already been processed). Consequently, the total number of elements in `nodes[ind]` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again, as we need one additional element beyond what has already been processed.

State: **`nodes[ind]` has at least 4 elements, `sosed` is the third element in the list**
