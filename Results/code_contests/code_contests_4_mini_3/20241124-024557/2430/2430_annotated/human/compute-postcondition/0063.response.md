Output State: **If `queue` is non-empty and the loop executes, `res[ind]` will be assigned a value of `val`. If `val` is greater than `HM` (51), the loop will terminate immediately after this assignment. If `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `val` will be incremented, and for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is 0, new pairs `[sosed, val]` will be appended to `queue`. If `queue` is empty before the loop starts, it will not execute, leaving `res` unchanged and remaining zeros. If all entries in `nodes[ind]` result in `res[sosed]` being non-zero, the loop will not execute, and `queue` will remain unchanged. At the end of the loop, if it executed, `queue` will be shorter depending on the number of valid `sosed` processed, `val` will be incremented by the number of iterations executed, and `res[ind]` will be updated with the last processed `val`. If `val` was modified before the loop and was greater than `HM`, the loop will not execute at all, and `queue` will remain unchanged.**
