Postcondition: ***If the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, if `res` contains elements, any element greater than 26 is replaced by `2 * 26 - val`, where `val` is that element. If all elements in `res` are less than or equal to 26, `res` remains unchanged. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged with all entries being 0. The final output is a string representation of the modified `res` list, where each element is converted to a corresponding character based on its value.***
