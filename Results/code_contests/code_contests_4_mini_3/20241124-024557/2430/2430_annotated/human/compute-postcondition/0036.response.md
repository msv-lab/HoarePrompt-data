Postcondition: ***`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is 0, `queue` now contains an additional entry `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, no changes are made to `queue`.***
