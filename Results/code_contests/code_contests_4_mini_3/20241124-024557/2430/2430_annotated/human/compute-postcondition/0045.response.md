The code assigns the value of `cur[0]` to `ind`. Since we know `cur` is assigned the value previously at the front of `queue`, `cur[0]` is defined and will replace the previous value of `ind`. The values of `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]`, `val`, and the length of `queue` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ind`.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` remains non-empty; `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`; `cur` is now assigned the value previously at the front of `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is now assigned the value of `cur[0]`; `queue` is now one element shorter.**
