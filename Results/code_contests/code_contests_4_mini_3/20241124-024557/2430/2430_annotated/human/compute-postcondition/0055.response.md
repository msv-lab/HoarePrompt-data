The code appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The value of `sosed` is already defined as the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and since `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, `sosed` will be valid. The state of `queue` changes, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and a new list containing `sosed` and `val` has been added to `queue`.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and a new list containing `sosed` and `val` has been added to `queue`**
