According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nodes[ind]` variable. The loop will execute for each element in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]` and `sosed` is set to the next element in `nodes[ind]`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the state of `nodes[ind]`. Since `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be additional elements in `nodes[ind]` beyond the current `sosed`. 

If `sosed` is the last element in `nodes[ind]`, then the loop cannot execute again. If `nodes[ind]` contains more elements, we need to adjust `sosed` to point to the next element in the `nodes[ind]`, and `ind` would remain unchanged.

Thus, we need to ensure that `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element after `sosed` for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`nodes[ind]` has at least one more element after `sosed`, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]` after the current one**.
