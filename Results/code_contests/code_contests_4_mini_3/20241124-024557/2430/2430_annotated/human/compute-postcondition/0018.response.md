The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The value of `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, while `val` is 52. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `HM`, `val`, and `sosed`. The state of the `queue` will change as it will now include a new element `[sosed, val]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` is updated to include `[sosed, 52]`.**
