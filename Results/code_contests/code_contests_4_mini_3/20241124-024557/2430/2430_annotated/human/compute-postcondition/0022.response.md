According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `queue` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, since `queue` is supposed to contain pairs `[sosed, 52]` for each `sosed` where `res[sosed]` is 0, we need to ensure that `queue` is still non-empty for the loop to execute again.

The conditions given state that if `nodes[ind]` is non-empty and contains elements such that `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, then `queue` will contain elements. Therefore, to ensure that `queue` can execute one more time, we should make sure that `nodes[ind]` remains non-empty and that at least one `sosed` still has `res[sosed]` equal to 0.

If `nodes[ind]` is empty or all `res[sosed]` are not 0, then `queue` will not have the pairs necessary for the loop to execute again. Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `nodes[ind]` is still non-empty and that `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`.

State: **`nodes[ind]` is non-empty and `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`**
