The variable `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, which means it takes the second element from the list `cur`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `cur`, but it indicates that `cur` is the first element removed from `queue`. Therefore, `cur` is expected to be a list-like structure with at least two elements. The value of `val` will depend on the second element of `cur`.

Since the specific values of `cur` and `val` are not defined in the initial state but we know that `cur` contains at least two items, we can conclude that the output state reflects that `val` is assigned from `cur[1]`, without detailing what `cur[1]` actually is.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `cur` is the first element removed from `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`.**
