The variable `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. The previous value of `ind` is 0, indicating that `val` will be assigned the first element of the list `res`. Since `res` has at least one element, the assignment is valid, but the specific value of `val` depends on the contents of `res`. The state of `queue` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, and `val` is the first element of `res`.

Output State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, and `val` is the first element of `res**
