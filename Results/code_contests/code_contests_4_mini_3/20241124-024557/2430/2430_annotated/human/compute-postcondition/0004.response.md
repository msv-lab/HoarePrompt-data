The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. The value of `cur` is determined by the initial state, where `cur` is the first element removed from `queue`. The values of `n`, `HM`, `res`, and `val` are not directly affected by this assignment. 

The output state will reflect the assignment made to `ind` using `cur[0]`, while also noting the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `cur` is the first element removed from `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`**.
