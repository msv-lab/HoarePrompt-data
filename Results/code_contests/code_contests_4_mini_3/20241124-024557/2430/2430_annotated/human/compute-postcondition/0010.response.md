According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must be a non-empty iterable (e.g., a list or array). Since `n` is given to be between 2 and 100,000 and does not affect the loop execution directly, we focus on the other variables.

Before the loop starts:
- `HM` is 51, which is relevant for the condition involving `val`. 
- `val` has been incremented by 1, which means if `val` was initially greater than `HM`, the most internal loop or if statement would have caused an exit. 
- Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `val` is now 52 (as it was incremented by 1), and that `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty iterable.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute, we must state that `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty iterable. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty iterable**
