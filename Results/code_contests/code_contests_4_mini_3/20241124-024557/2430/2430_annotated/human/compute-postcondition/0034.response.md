According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]`. The loop will execute again for each element in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` is non-empty, which means there is at least one more element that can be processed in the next iteration.

The loop will iterate over each element in `nodes[ind]`, and since `sosed` will take each value from that list, for the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[ind]` must have at least one more element. As the state indicates that `nodes[ind]` is non-empty, we need to ensure that after the last iteration, the next value of `sosed` can be assigned from the remaining elements in `nodes[ind]`.

Therefore, we can adjust the state to indicate that `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one more element, and `sosed` should be assigned the next value from `nodes[ind]`. We do not have explicit information about the contents of `nodes[ind]`, so we will assume it still has elements left to process.

State: **`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `sosed` is the next element in nodes[ind]**
