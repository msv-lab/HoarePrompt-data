The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes[ind]` remains non-empty; `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`; `cur` is now assigned the value previously at the front of `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is now assigned the value of `cur[0]`; `queue` is now one element shorter; `res[ind]` is now assigned the value of `val` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
