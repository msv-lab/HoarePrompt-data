Output State: **`nodes[ind]` remains non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by the number of iterations, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, if `res[sosed]` is 0, `queue` will contain additional appended lists `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` was not 0 for all `sosed`, then `queue` remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` is empty or all `res[sosed]` are non-zero, the loop does not execute and the state of `queue`, `val`, and `ind` remains unchanged.**
