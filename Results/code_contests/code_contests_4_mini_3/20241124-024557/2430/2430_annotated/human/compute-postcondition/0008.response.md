Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` has one value updated at index `ind` to `val`, where `val` is an integer assigned the value of `cur[1]` and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. If `val` is greater than `HM` (51), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, the program continues execution without breaking.***
