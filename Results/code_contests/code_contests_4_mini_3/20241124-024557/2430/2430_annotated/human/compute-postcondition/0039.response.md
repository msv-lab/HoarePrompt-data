Postcondition: ***`nodes[ind]` has at least one more element after `sosed`, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]` after the current one, and if `res[sosed]` was 0, then `queue` now contains an additional element `[sosed, val]`; if `res[sosed]` was not 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
