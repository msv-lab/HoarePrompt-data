According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes` list at the index `ind`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element (which it does, as stated). The loop will iterate over each element in `nodes[ind]`, assigning each element to `sosed` in each iteration.

Before the loop starts, we have:
- `nodes[ind]` is non-empty, so there is at least one `sosed` to iterate over.
- `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, indicating that the condition may be relevant within the loop body.
- `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, which is already set.
- `val` is incremented by 1, indicating some state change before the loop execution.
- `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, which is also set.

Since `nodes[ind]` is non-empty, we do not need to adjust any states related to it for the loop to execute. However, the loop will execute with `sosed` taking values from `nodes[ind]`.

State: **`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`**
