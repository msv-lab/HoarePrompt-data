The expression `HM = 2 * 26 - 1` calculates the value of `HM`. The value 26 is a constant. Thus, the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Multiply 2 by 26, which equals 52.
2. Subtract 1 from 52, which results in 51.

The initial state only mentions `n` and does not affect the calculation of `HM`. Therefore, the output state reflects the computed value of `HM`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51**
