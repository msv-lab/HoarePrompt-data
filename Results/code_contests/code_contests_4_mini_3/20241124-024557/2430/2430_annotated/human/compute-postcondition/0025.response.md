The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, which extracts the first element from the list or tuple stored in `cur`. The values of `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]`, `cur`, and `val` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `ind` now holds this new value. The previous state of `cur` and its first element is necessary to determine `ind`. Therefore, the output state is: `nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is assigned a value from the front of `queue`, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]**
