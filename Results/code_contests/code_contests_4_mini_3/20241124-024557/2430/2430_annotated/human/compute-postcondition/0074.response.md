Output State: **If `res` is a list with at least one element, then after the loop, `res` will have been modified such that any element greater than 26 is replaced by `2 * 26 - val`, where `val` is that element. If `res` contains elements all less than or equal to 26, it remains unchanged. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged with all entries being 0. `ind` will be the index of the currently processed element, ranging from 0 to `len(res) - 1` during execution.**
