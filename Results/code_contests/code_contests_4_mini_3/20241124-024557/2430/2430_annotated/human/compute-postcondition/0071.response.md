According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `res` list. The loop will execute for each index from `0` to `len(res) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1, and `res` has at least 2 elements. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented to 2, and `res` must have at least 3 elements to accommodate the next index. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `ind` needs to be updated to 2.
- `res` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, and `val` is the third element of `res`**
