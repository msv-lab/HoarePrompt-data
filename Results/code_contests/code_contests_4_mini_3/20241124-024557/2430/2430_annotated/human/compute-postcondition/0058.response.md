The code appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. Since `nodes[ind]` has at least 3 elements, it indicates that both `sosed` and `val` exist and are valid values to be added to the `queue`. The previous state of the `queue` will be updated to include this new entry, but the state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` has at least 3 elements, `sosed` is the next element in the list, and `queue` now contains an additional entry [sosed, val]**
