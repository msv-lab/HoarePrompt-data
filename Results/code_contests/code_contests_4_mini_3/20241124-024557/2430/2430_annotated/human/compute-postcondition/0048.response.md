Postcondition: ***`nodes[ind]` remains non-empty; `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`; `cur` is assigned the value previously at the front of `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`; `queue` is one element shorter; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues executing the subsequent code.***
