The value of `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`, where `ind` is 1. Since `res` is a list with at least 2 elements, `val` will be assigned the second element of `res`. The state of `queue` is not affected, and `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, and `val` is the second element of `res`.

Output State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, and `val` is the second element of `res`**
