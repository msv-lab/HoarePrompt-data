You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is lower than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: If `queue` is non-empty and the loop executes, `res[ind]` will be assigned a value of `val`. If `val` is greater than `HM` (51), the loop will terminate immediately after this assignment. If `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `val` will be incremented, and for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is 0, new pairs `[sosed, val]` will be appended to `queue`. If `queue` is empty before the loop starts, it will not execute, leaving `res` unchanged and remaining zeros. If all entries in `nodes[ind]` result in `res[sosed]` being non-zero, the loop will not execute, and `queue` will remain unchanged. At the end of the loop, if it executed, `queue` will be shorter depending on the number of valid `sosed` processed, `val` will be incremented by the number of iterations executed, and `res[ind]` will be updated with the last processed `val`. If `val` was modified before the loop and was greater than `HM`, the loop will not execute at all, and `queue` will remain unchanged.
if condition:
```
if (max(res) > HM):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
