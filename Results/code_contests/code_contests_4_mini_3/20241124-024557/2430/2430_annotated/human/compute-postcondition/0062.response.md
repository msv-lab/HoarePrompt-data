According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `nodes[ind]` remains non-empty, which suggests that there are still elements to process, and `queue` is shorter by the number of times the loop executed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must still contain at least one element after the adjustments made in the previous iteration.

Since it is indicated that `queue` has been shortened by the number of times the loop executed, the initial length of `queue` must have been at least 1 more than the number of executions of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure that `queue` remains non-empty for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `queue` still has elements. 

State: **`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0 for each `sosed` processed, `cur` is the value previously at the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `queue` has at least 1 more element remaining after the last execution.**
