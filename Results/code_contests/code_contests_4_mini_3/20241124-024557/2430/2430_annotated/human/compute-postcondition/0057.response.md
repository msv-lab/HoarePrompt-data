According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. If `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, the loop can iterate through each of them. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element left in `nodes[ind]` for the variable `sosed` to take on a new value. Since the loop processes each element in `nodes[ind]`, we can infer that the first iteration has consumed one element from this list. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `nodes[ind]` must have at least 3 elements at the start of the next iteration, and the value of `sosed` would need to be adjusted to reflect the next element being accessed.

State: **`nodes[ind]` has at least 3 elements, sosed is the next element in the list**
