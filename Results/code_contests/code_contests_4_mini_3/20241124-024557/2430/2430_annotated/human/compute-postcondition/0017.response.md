According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[ind]` must have at least one more element than it did at the end of the last iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, which means there are still elements available to iterate over. However, we need to ensure that the next state reflects the fact that one element has been processed and that there is still an element left in `nodes[ind]`.

To facilitate this, we need to adjust the state of `sosed` to the next element in the list `nodes[ind]`. 

Since `nodes[ind]` had at least one more element, we can conclude that:

1. The next value of `sosed` should be the next element in `nodes[ind]`, which implies an increase in the index of `sosed`.
2. The state of `nodes[ind]` must remain unchanged in terms of having at least one more element; it still needs to have elements left after the current iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state would be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `val` is 52, and `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`**
