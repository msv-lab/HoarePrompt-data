Postcondition: ***`nodes[ind]` is non-empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` is assigned the value previously at the front of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `queue` is one element shorter, `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val - 1`, and since `res[sosed]` is 0, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]` and `sosed` along with `val` is appended to `queue`. If `res[sosed]` was not 0, the queue remains unchanged.***
