Output State: **If `nodes[ind]` is non-empty and contains elements such that `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, then `queue` will contain pairs `[sosed, 52]` for each such `sosed`. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, or if all values of `res[sosed]` are not 0, then `queue` remains unchanged. The value of `val` remains 52 after the loop execution. Additionally, if `val` was modified before the loop and is still greater than `HM` (51), the loop will not execute at all, and `queue` will remain unchanged.**
