According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on whether `queue` is not empty. For the loop to execute again, `queue` must contain entries. At the end of the last iteration, if `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, then `queue` contains entries for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, meaning that `nodes[ind]` is not empty and at least one element in `res` corresponding to `nodes[ind]` is 0. 

Since the condition for the loop to execute is that `queue` must not be empty, and given that `queue` contains entries at the end of the previous iteration, there are no states that need to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **If `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, then `queue` contains entries for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`.**
