The code appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The previous state of the variables indicates that `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`, and `val` is an integer between 1 and 52. The `queue` variable is modified by adding a new element, but other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `cur` has had its first element removed, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` has been updated to include [sosed, val].**
