The code appends the list `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `sosed`, which is a neighbor of `nodes[ind]`, and `val`, which is greater than or equal to 1. The `queue` is updated to include this new element, but no other variables in the initial state are altered by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed`; `res[sosed]` is equal to 0; and `queue` now includes `[sosed, val]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed`; `res[sosed]` is equal to 0; and `queue` now includes `[sosed, val]`.**
