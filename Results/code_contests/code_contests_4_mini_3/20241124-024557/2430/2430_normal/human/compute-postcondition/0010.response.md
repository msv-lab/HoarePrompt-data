According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes` list and specifically the element at index `ind`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must be a list that contains at least one element. Additionally, the variable `sosed` will represent each element in the list during the iterations.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, and we have `HM`, `res`, `cur`, and `val` set as described, the key state that needs to be ensured is that `nodes[ind]` is not empty.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to confirm that `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element. We can assume that the current loop variable `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]` during the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `cur` has had its first element removed, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`**
