Output State: **`res` is a list where each element greater than 26 has been transformed to `2 * 26 - val`, `ind` is the index of the current element being processed, `cur` remains unchanged, `queue` can be empty or contain elements. If `res` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `res` remains unchanged. If all elements of `res` are less than or equal to 26, the loop executes but makes no changes to `res`.**
