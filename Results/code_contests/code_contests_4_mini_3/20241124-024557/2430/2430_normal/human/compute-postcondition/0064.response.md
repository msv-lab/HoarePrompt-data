Postcondition: ***`queue` is non-empty and the first element of `queue` has a value less than or equal to `HM`. `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, where `val` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52. The maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, indicating that at least one entry in `res` is greater than `HM`. The values of `cur`, `ind`, and `res` are unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged. The entries for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 are present in `queue` and the loop will execute based on the above conditions.***
