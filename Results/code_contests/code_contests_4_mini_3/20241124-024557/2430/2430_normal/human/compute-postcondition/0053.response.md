Postcondition: ***`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, if the element at index `sosed` of `res` is equal to 0, then `queue` includes the entry `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
