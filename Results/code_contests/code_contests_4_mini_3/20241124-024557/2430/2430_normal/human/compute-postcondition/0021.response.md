Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `cur` has had its first element removed, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52. If `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least `k` elements, where `k` is the number of neighbors, then the loop will execute `k` times. For each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `queue` is updated to include the pair `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, then `queue` remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
