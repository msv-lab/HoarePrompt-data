According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, and `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`. This indicates that `nodes[ind]` must have at least 3 elements, and `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must remain the same, and `nodes[ind]` needs to have at least 4 elements. This means `sosed` must be updated to the next element in the `nodes[ind]` list, which would be the fourth element. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted for `sosed` to point to the fourth element of `nodes[ind]`, and `nodes[ind]` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 4 elements where `sosed` is the fourth element of `nodes[ind]`.**
