The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. The state of `cur` has been modified by removing its first element, which means `cur[0]` is now the second element of the original `cur` list. The values of `n`, `HM`, `res`, and `val` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, while other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0; `cur` has its first element removed; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`.**
