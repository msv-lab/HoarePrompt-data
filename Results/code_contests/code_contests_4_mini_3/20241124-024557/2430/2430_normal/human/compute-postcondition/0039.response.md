Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least 1 neighbor `sosed`; if `res[sosed]` is 0, then `queue` is updated to include an additional element `[sosed, val]`, indicating that `sosed` has not been processed yet. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, then the queue remains unchanged.***
