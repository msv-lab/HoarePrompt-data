The code initializes a list `res` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `HM` remains unchanged at 51. The output state reflects the state of `n` and the newly created list `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0**
