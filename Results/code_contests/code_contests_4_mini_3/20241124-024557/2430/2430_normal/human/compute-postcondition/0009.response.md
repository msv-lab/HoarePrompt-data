The code increments the value of `val` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `val`, we know that if `val` is greater than 51, the execution would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement before this code runs. Therefore, we can only confirm that `val` is less than or equal to 51 at this point.

After running the code, `val` will be updated to `val + 1`. The states of other variables `n`, `HM`, `res`, and `cur` are not affected.

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`; `cur` has had its first element removed; `val` is now an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`; `cur` has had its first element removed; `val` is now an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52.**
