The variable `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`. Since `val` has been assigned the value of `cur[1]` and `ind` holds a specific index where `res` is being updated, the state of `res` at index `ind` is now equal to `cur[1]`. The other variables (`n`, `HM`, `val`, `nodes`, `cur`, and `ind`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`, `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue` which has been popped, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]**
