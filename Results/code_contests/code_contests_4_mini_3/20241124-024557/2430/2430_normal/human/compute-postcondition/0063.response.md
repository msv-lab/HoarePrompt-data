Output State: **`if queue is non-empty and the first element of queue has a value less than or equal to HM, then res[ind]` is updated to `val`, where `val` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52. `queue` will contain entries for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0. If `val` exceeds HM, the loop will not execute further, and the values of `cur`, `ind`, `res`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `queue` is empty before the loop starts, it does not execute and `res` remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` is empty or all neighbors have non-zero values in `res`, the loop will not execute, leaving `queue` unchanged.`**
