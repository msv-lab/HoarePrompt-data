According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `res` list. The loop iterates over the range of the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2, which means the loop has executed for `ind` values 0, 1, and 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the index `ind` must be incremented to 3, and `res` must have at least 4 elements (since `len(res)` must be greater than `ind` for the loop to continue). Currently, `res` has at least 3 elements, and since `res[ind]` remains unchanged, the next element `val` would need to be the fourth element of `res`.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- The length of `res` must be at least 4.
- `ind` must be 3.
- `val` must be the fourth element of `res`.

State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 4 elements, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, all elements of `res` are less than or equal to HM, `val` is the fourth element of `res`, `cur` remains unchanged, `ind` is 3**
