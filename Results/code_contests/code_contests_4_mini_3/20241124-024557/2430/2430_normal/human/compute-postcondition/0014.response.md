According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, and `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[ind]` must have at least 2 elements, and `sosed` needs to be updated to the next element in the list.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements and update `sosed` to the second element in `nodes[ind]`. The index of `sosed` should also be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `cur` has had its first element removed, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`, and if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `queue` includes the element `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.**
