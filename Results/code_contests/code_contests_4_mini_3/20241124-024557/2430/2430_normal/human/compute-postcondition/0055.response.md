The code appends the list `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are derived from the initial state, where `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`, and `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. Since `queue` may or may not include the entry based on the value of `res[sosed]`, we assume the entry is successfully appended.

The state of other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`, and the new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`, and the new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`**.
