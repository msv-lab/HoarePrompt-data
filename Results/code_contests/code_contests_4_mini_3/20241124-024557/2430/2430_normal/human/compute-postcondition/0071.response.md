According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `res`. The loop iterates over the indices of the `res` list, starting from 0 up to (but not including) the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1, which means the loop has executed for the indices 0 and 1.

To execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to 2, and the loop can continue if the length of `res` is greater than 2. Since `res` currently has at least 2 elements, it must now be at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, `val` should represent the third element of `res`.

State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, all elements of `res` are less than or equal to HM, `val` is now the third element of `res`, `cur` remains unchanged, `ind` is 2**
