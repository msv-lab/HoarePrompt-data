According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `len(res)` value. The loop will iterate for `ind` from 0 to `len(res) - 1`. Since at the end of the last iteration `ind` is 0, the loop can execute again only if `len(res)` is greater than 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `res` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must have at least 2 elements, and `ind` should be 1, referring to the second element in the list.

State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 2 elements, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, all elements of `res` are less than or equal to HM, `val` is the first element of `res`, `cur` remains unchanged, `ind` is 1**
