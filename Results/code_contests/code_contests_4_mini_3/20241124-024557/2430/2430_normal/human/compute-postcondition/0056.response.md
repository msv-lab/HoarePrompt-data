Postcondition: ***`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements where `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, the entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, then `queue` remains unchanged.***
