Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is incremented by 1; `res[ind]` remains updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` and `ind` are the first element of `queue` that was popped and the value of `cur[0]`, respectively; `nodes[ind]` still contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.**
