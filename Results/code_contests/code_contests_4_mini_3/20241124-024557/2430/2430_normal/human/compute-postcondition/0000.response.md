The variable `HM` is assigned the value of `2 * 26 - 1`. The calculation leads to `HM` being `52 - 1`, which results in `HM` being `51`. The values of `n` and the roads are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `HM` is 51.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `HM` is 51**
