Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed`. If `res[sosed]` was 0 before the execution, then `queue` now includes `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` was not 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
