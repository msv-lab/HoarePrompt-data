Output State: **If `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, then `queue` contains entries for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the loop does not execute, and the values of `cur`, `ind`, `res`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `nodes[ind]` is empty or if all elements of `res` corresponding to `nodes[ind]` are not equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
