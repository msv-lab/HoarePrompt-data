According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the neighbors of the current node `ind` as represented by `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is the index of the current node, and `nodes[ind]` contains at least 1 neighbor `sosed`. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one additional neighbor of `ind` that has not been processed yet (i.e., `res[sosed]` should be 0).

Since we know that `nodes[ind]` has at least one neighbor already processed, we must ensure that there is another neighbor available for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that one of the neighbors (let's say `sosed` must be a new neighbor) must have `res[sosed]` equal to 0, indicating that it has not been processed yet.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least 2 neighbors, one of which is `sosed` where `res[sosed]` is 0; `queue` is updated to include an additional element `[sosed, val]`.**
