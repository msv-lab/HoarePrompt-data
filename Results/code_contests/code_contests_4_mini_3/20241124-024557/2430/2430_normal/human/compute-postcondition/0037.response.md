According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]`. The loop iterates over each neighbor `sosed` of the current node `ind`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `nodes[ind]` contains at least 2 neighbors, as stated. Since the loop has already executed once for one of the neighbors, for it to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more neighbor available in `nodes[ind]`.

Therefore, if the loop has already executed for one of the neighbors, the number of neighbors left for iteration must be at least 1. If `nodes[ind]` initially contained at least 2 neighbors, after one iteration, it should still contain at least 1 neighbor remaining.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `nodes[ind]` now must contain at least 1 neighbor left to continue the loop, and we also need to indicate that we are iterating over the next neighbor.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least 1 neighbor `sosed`; `queue` remains unchanged.**
