To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the state of the `queue` and the conditions under which the loop will run.

1. The loop condition is `while queue:` meaning the loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty.
2. The current state specifies that `cur` has had its first element removed, but it does not provide any information about the contents of `queue` after that operation.
3. The loop will execute if `queue` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `queue` is not empty for the next iteration.
4. Since the state mentions that `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, and if `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least `k` elements, this means that there are neighbors that could potentially be added to the `queue`.
5. We need to ensure that at least one of the neighbors in `nodes[ind]` has `res[sosed]` equal to 0 so that `[sosed, val]` can be added to `queue`. 

Given that `queue` could be empty after the previous iteration due to the removal of the first element of `cur`, we need to adjust it to make sure that it will contain at least one new pair to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `cur` has had its first element removed, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, and `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, allowing `queue` to be updated.**
