The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are defined as follows: `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]` and `val` is an integer between 1 and 52. The operation does not affect the previous values of `n`, `HM`, `res`, `cur`, or `nodes`, but it modifies the state of the `queue` by adding a new element to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `cur` has had its first element removed, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`, the value of `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `queue` now includes the element `[sosed, val]`.**
