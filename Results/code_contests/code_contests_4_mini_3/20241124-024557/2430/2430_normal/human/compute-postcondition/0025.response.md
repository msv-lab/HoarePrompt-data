The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. Since `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `cur[0]` is the first element of that element in the queue. The value of `ind` is now determined by whatever that first element is, but the specific value is not provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue` which has been popped, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]**.
