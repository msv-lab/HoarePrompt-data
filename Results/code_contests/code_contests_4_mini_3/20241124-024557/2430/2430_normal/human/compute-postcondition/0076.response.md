The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the `nodes` parameter represents roads as pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, ensuring that all cities are connected in a tree structure. After executing the function body, if the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. If `res` is not empty, it may undergo transformations based on the values it contains. The final output is a string representation of the transformed `res` list, where each value is converted to a corresponding character based on its position.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. It returns 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`; otherwise, it returns a string representation of the transformed `res` list.**
