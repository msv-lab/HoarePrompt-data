Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. If `val` is greater than `HM` (which is 51), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the current state of `res[ind]` remains updated to `cur[1]`, reflecting the last values assigned before the break. If `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, the program continues execution without breaking. Additionally, `nodes[ind]` still contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and the values of `cur` and `ind` remain as the first element of `queue` that was popped and the value of `cur[0]`, respectively.***
