The code appends a new element `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The previous state of the `queue` is unchanged, and it now includes an additional entry. The other variables such as `n`, `val`, `res[ind]`, `cur`, `ind`, and `nodes[ind]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least 1 neighbor `sosed`; `queue` is updated to include an additional element `[sosed, val]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least 1 neighbor `sosed`; `queue` is updated to include an additional element `[sosed, val]`.**
