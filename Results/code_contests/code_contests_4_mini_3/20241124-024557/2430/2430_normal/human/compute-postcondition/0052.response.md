The code appends a list containing the values `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. Since `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least one element, and `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, it indicates that the operation is valid and does not affect other variables. The state of `queue` now includes the new entry, but the values of `val`, `HM`, `cur`, `ind`, `nodes[ind]`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, the element at index `sosed` of `res` is equal to 0, and `queue` now includes the entry `[sosed, val]`.**
