The value of `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`, where `ind` is 2. Since `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `res[ind]` will successfully obtain the value of the third element of `res`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, all elements of `res` are less than or equal to HM, `val` is now the third element of `res`, `cur` remains unchanged, `ind` is 2.
