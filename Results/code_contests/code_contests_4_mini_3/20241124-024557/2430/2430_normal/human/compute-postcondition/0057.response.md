According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nodes[ind]`. The loop iterates over the elements of `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, which means that the current index in `nodes` is being referenced. Given that `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is currently the second element, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element available for the loop to execute again.

To execute one more time, `sosed` must be updated to the next element in the list `nodes[ind]`. Therefore, `sosed` should be the third element of `nodes[ind]`, and since `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, it is reasonable to ensure that it has at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 3 elements where `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`.**
