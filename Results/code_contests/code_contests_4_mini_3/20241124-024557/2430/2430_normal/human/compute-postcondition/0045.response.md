The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, which is the first element of `cur`. This assignment does not affect any other variables directly, but it updates `ind` with the value from `cur`. The values of `cur`, `res[ind]`, `nodes[ind]`, `queue`, and `val` remain unchanged at this step. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `ind`.

Output State: **`ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`**
