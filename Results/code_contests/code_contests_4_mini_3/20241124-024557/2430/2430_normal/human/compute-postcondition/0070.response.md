The code assigns the value of `res[ind]` to `val`. The variable `ind` has a value of 1, so `val` is now assigned the second element of the `res` list. The other variables `queue`, `res`, `cur`, and `ind` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 2 elements, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, all elements of `res` are less than or equal to HM, `val` is now the second element of `res`, `cur` remains unchanged, `ind` is 1.
