According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `nodes[ind]`, which is a list. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in `nodes[ind]` that has not yet been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element. To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider that `sosed` will take on the next value from `nodes[ind]`. Therefore, we must adjust the state to reflect that `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`.

However, since we do not have information on how many elements are in `nodes[ind]`, we must also ensure that the list has more elements to allow for another iteration. Thus, we should adjust the state to indicate that `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, and we can set `sosed` to the second element.

State: **`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`, `queue` may or may not include the entry `[sosed, val]` based on the value of `res[sosed]`**
