Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`, `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue` which has been popped, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
