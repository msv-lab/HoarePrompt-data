The variable `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`. The value of `cur` is derived from the first element of `queue`, which has been popped. Since `cur` is an element of `queue`, the specific value of `cur[1]` is not defined in the initial state but is assumed to be accessible. The other variables (`n`, `HM`, `res`, `val`, `nodes`, `ind`, and `sosed`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue` which has been popped.
