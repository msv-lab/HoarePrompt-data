According to the code, the loop iterates over the neighbors of `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to be ensured that there is at least one more neighbor to process in `nodes[ind]`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed`, meaning it has at least one element.
- The loop will execute for each neighbor in `nodes[ind]`.

To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we have processed one neighbor and that there must be at least one additional neighbor left to process.

Thus, we need to adjust `nodes[ind]` to have at least one more neighbor remaining. If `nodes[ind]` initially had `k` neighbors, after one iteration it will have `k - 1` remaining. Therefore, we must ensure that `nodes[ind]` contains at least `2` neighbors for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains at least 2 neighbors `sosed`. If `res[sosed]` was 0 before the execution, then `queue` now includes `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` was not 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.**
