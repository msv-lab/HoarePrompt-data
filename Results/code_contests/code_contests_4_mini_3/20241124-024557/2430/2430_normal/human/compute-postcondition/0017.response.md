According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. The loop iterates over each element in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is the second element of that list. 

Since `sosed` is the second element, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element after the second element in the `nodes[ind]` list. This means that `nodes[ind]` must have at least 3 elements, and `sosed` should be adjusted to the third element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `nodes[ind]` must have at least 3 elements, and `sosed` must be the third element of `nodes[ind]`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `cur` has had its first element removed, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`**
