Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `cur` has had its first element removed, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `queue` is updated to include the element `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
