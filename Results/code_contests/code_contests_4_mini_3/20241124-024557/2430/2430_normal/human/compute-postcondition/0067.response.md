According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `res`. The loop iterates over the range of the length of `res`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `res` must contain at least one element (i.e., `len(res)` must be greater than 0). 

Since `ind` is initialized with the first value from the range, it will start at 0. Given that `cur`, `ind`, and `queue` remain unchanged, we still need to ensure that `res` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 1 element, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, all elements of `res` are less than or equal to HM, `val` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `cur` remains unchanged, `ind` is 0**
