The value of `cur` is assigned the result of `queue.pop(0)`, which removes and returns the first element from the `queue`. The initial values of `n`, `HM`, and `res` are not directly affected by this operation. However, we do not have information about the contents of `queue`, which is crucial for determining the value of `cur`. Therefore, the output state indicates that the variable `cur` is assigned a value from the `queue` and that this operation modifies the `queue` by removing its first element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0; `cur` is assigned a value from `queue` and `queue` is modified by removing its first element.**
