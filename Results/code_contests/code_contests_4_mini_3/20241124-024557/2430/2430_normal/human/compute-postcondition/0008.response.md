Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`; `cur` has had its first element removed; `val` is an integer. If `val` is greater than 51, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `val` is less than or equal to 51, there are no further actions taken in this block.***
