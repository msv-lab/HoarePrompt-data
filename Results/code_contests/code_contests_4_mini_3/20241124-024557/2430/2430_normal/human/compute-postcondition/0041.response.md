Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is greater than or equal to 1; `res[ind]` is updated to `cur[1]`; `cur` is the first element of `queue` that was popped; `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` contains neighbors `sosed`. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then `queue` is updated to include `[sosed, val]` for each valid neighbor `sosed`. If `nodes[ind]` has no neighbors, or all `res[sosed]` values are not 0, the loop will not execute, and `queue` remains unchanged. In cases where `res[ind]` is updated but no valid neighbors exist, `queue` will remain the same, and no new elements will be added.**
