The variable `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. The value of `ind` is 0, so `val` takes the value of the first element of the list `res`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `queue` can be empty or contain elements, `res` is a list with at least 1 element, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, all elements of `res` are less than or equal to HM, `val` is the first element of `res`, `cur` remains unchanged, `ind` is 0.
