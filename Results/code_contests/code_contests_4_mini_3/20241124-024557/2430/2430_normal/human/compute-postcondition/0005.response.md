The value of `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`. The variable `cur` has had its first element removed, and `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, while `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. The exact values of `ind` and `val` depend on the specific contents of `cur`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `res[ind]` is now equal to `val`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`; `cur` has its first element removed; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]**.
