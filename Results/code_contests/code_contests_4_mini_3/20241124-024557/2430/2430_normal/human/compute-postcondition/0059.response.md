Postcondition: ***`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `cur` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 3 elements where `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is 0, `queue` is updated to include the list `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, `queue` remains unchanged.***
