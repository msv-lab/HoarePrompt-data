The value of `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue` after it is popped (removed). The `queue` is updated by removing its first element, but the specific values of `cur` and `queue` prior to this operation are not provided. Other variables and states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue` which has been popped.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` has been updated at index `ind` to `val`, `val` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one neighbor `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue` which has been popped.**
