Postcondition: ***If the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, for each index `ind` in `res`, if the value at that index exceeds 26, it is transformed to `2 * 26 - val`, while `cur` remains unchanged and `queue` can be either empty or contain elements. If `res` is empty, no changes are made to `res`. If all values in `res` are less than or equal to 26, the loop executes but does not modify `res`. The final result is a string representation of the transformed `res` list, where each value is converted to a corresponding character based on its position.***
