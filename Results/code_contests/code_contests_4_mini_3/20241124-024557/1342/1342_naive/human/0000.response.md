To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description regarding Mr. Funt's tax situation, we need to analyze how the program handles different inputs.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Mr. Funt needs to pay taxes based on the maximum divisor of his income `n`, excluding `n` itself.
2. He can split `n` into parts, each at least `2`, to minimize his tax payout.
3. The expected outputs are:
   - If `n` is prime, he pays `1`.
   - If `n` is even, he pays `2`.
   - If `n` is odd and can be expressed as `n - 2` (where `n - 2` is prime), he pays `2`.
   - Otherwise, he pays `3`.

### Program Analysis:
The program implements the following logic:
- It defines a function `func_7(n)` to check if `n` is prime.
- It checks:
  - If `n` is prime, it prints `1`.
  - If `n` is even, it prints `2`.
  - If `n` is odd and `n - 2` is prime, it prints `2`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `3`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case for Even Numbers**: 
   - For `n = 4`, the program outputs `2`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 6`, it correctly outputs `2`.
2. **Case for Prime Numbers**:
   - For `n = 3`, the program outputs `1`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 11`, the program outputs `1`, which is also correct.
3. **Case for Odd Numbers**:
   - For `n = 9`, the program checks `func_7(9)`, which returns `False`. It then checks `func_7(7)` (since `9 - 2 = 7`), which returns `True`. It outputs `2`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 15`, it checks `func_7(15)` (returns `False`), then checks `func_7(13)` (returns `True`). It should output `2`, but the program will output `3`, which is incorrect as it should have returned `2` for `n = 15`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the case for odd composite numbers where `n - 2` is prime. 

Thus, the output for the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
