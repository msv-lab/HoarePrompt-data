According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate with `i` starting from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. In the provided state, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, and `i` is currently 2.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since `i` starts at 2, the next value of `i` will be 3 in the next iteration.

The condition for the loop to execute again is:
- `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`, which holds true if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The value of `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` will be greater than or equal to 102, since `n` is at least 2.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which will increment to 3 in the next iteration. The value of `n` does not need to change, as it satisfies the conditions for the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `i` is 3**
