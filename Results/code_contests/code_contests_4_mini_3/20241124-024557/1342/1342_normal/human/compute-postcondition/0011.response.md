Output State: **If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, the loop will check divisibility of `n` by integers starting from 2 up to approximately the square root of `n` plus 100. If `n` is divisible by any `i` (where `i` is between 2 and the calculated limit) and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function will return False, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is not divisible by `i` or if `n` equals `i`, the loop continues without returning. If `n` is 2, the loop does not execute since the range starts from 2, and thus no divisibility checks are performed, leading to an implicit return of None. If `n` is any integer greater than 2, the loop may execute multiple times depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is a prime number, the loop will complete without returning and the function will implicitly return None.**
