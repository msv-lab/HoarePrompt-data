According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since the provided information states that if `n` is an integer between 2 and 2,000,000,000 and is not divisible by 4, the function does not return anything, it suggests that the loop can continue executing as long as `i` is within the specified range.

However, since we do not have the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we need to assume it was at its maximum limit for the last iteration. To prepare for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Letâ€™s denote the current state of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i`. We know that `n` is between 2 and 2,000,000,000, and since `n` is not equal to 4, the value of `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` needs to be calculated. 

To ensure the loop can continue executing, we need to adjust `i` so that it is less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Hence, if `i` was previously at its maximum limit, we need to increment it:

1. `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must now be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.

Therefore, we do not need to change `n` since it remains within the specified bounds.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2,000,000,000, `i` is the incremented value from the previous iteration**.
