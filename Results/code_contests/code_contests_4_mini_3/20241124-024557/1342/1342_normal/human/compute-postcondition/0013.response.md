The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000. 

- Case 1: If `n` is divisible by any integer `i` (where `i` is between 2 and approximately the square root of `n` plus 100) and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is equal to 2, the loop does not execute, leading to an implicit return of `None`. If `n` is any integer greater than 2 and is a prime number, the loop completes without returning and the function implicitly returns `None`.

- Case 2: If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n`, and it will return `False` if `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is a prime number, it returns `True`. If `n` is equal to 2, it implicitly returns `None`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns `False` if n is not a prime number. If n is a prime number, it returns `True`. If n is equal to 2, it implicitly returns None.**
