Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2,000,000,000. If `n` is divisible by `i` (which is 3) and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `n` is not prime. If `n` is not divisible by `i` or if `n` equals `i`, there is no return statement, and the function continues execution without returning a value.***
