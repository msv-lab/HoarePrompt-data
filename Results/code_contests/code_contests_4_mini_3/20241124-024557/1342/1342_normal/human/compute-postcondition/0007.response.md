To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop structure.

1. **Understanding the loop**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `2` to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. This means that the loop will execute for values of `i` starting at `2` and going up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100) - 1`.

2. **Current state**: We know that `i` is currently `3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since `n` is an integer between `2` and `2,000,000,000`, we need to calculate `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.

3. **Next value of `i`**: The next value of `i` after `3` would be `4`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `4` is still less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.

4. **Condition for adjustment**: Since `n` can be as large as `2,000,000,000`, we need to check the square root:
    - The square root of `2,000,000,000` is approximately `44721.35955`.
    - Adding `100` gives us approximately `44821.35955`, and taking the integer part gives `44821`.
    - Thus, `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` is at least `44821` when `n` is at its maximum.

5. **Conclusion**: For `i` to equal `4` and for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is still within the bounds such that `44821 > 4`.

So, the only adjustments we need to ensure the loop executes one more time are:
- Set `i` to `4` (the next value in the iteration).
- Ensure that `n` remains valid and does not affect the loop condition.

Thus, the final state should reflect these changes. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2,000,000,000, `i` is 4**
