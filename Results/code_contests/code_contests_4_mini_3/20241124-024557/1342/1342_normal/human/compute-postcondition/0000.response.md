According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. The range for the loop is determined by `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`, which will be at least 102 when `n` is at least 2. Hence, the loop can execute as long as `i` starts from 2 and goes up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`, which means it will execute at least once if `n` is 2 or greater. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will initialize to 2. Therefore, the necessary states to confirm the loop can execute are that `n` is as described and `i` starts at 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `i` is 2**
