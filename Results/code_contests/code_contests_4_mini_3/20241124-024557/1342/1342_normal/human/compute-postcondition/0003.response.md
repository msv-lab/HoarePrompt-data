Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000. If `n` is divisible by `i` (which is 2) and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is either not divisible by `i` or equal to `i`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None), implying that the evaluation of `n` regarding divisibility by `i` does not confirm it is non-prime.***
