Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is divisible by any integer `i` from 2 up to approximately the square root of `n` plus 100, and `n` is not equal to `i`. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime. However, if `n` is equal to 2, the function does not perform any checks and implicitly returns `None`, which is an edge case where it should ideally return `True` since 2 is a prime number. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, which may lead to unintended behavior since prime numbers are defined only for integers greater than 1.**
