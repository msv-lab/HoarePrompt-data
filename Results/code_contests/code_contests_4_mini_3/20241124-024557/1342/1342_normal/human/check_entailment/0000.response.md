To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's break down the code and its functionality.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the minimum tax Mr. Funt has to pay based on his total income `n`, which is defined as follows:
- The tax is calculated as the maximum divisor of `n` that is not equal to `n`.
- Mr. Funt can split his income `n` into parts, each part must be at least 2, and the goal is to minimize the total tax paid.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_7(n)`**:
    - This function checks if `n` is a prime number.
    - It iterates through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of `n` to determine if `n` has any divisors.
    - It incorrectly handles the case when `n = 2`, as it does not return `True` for this prime number.
  
2. **Main Logic**:
    - If `n` is prime (according to `func_7`), the output is `1` (indicating that the tax is `1`).
    - If `n` is even, the output is `2` (the largest divisor is `n/2`).
    - If `n` is odd and `n - 2` is prime, the output is also `2`.
    - Otherwise, the output is `3`, suggesting that the tax cannot be reduced below this value.

### Edge Cases
- The handling of `n = 2` is a significant edge case. According to the description, the tax should be `1` for `n = 2`, but `func_7` will not return `True`, leading to incorrect output.
- The check for odd numbers where `n - 2` is prime is not comprehensive because it doesn't cover all scenarios where splitting `n` could yield a lower tax.

### Output Hints
The output hints confirm some of the functionality but do not address the issue with `n = 2` and the missing checks for other potential split scenarios.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the case when `n = 2`, as it leads to an incorrect assumption that it is not a prime number. This oversight means that the program does not fulfill the conditions set forth in the problem description for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Reason
The program fails to return `1` for `n = 2`, which should be the minimum tax according to the problem description. This indicates that the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case, thus making it incorrect.
