The function accepts a list of elements and returns the product of those elements. It converts each element to a string and joins them with a '*' character before evaluating the expression. If the list is empty, it will raise a `SyntaxError` due to the empty string being passed to `eval`. If the list contains non-numeric types, it may raise a `TypeError` or `ValueError` during evaluation.
