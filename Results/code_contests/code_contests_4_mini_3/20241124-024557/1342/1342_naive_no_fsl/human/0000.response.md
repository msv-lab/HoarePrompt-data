To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and how it aligns with the requirements.

The program aims to determine the minimum tax Mr. Funt has to pay based on splitting his income `n` into parts, with each part being at least 2. The tax is calculated as the maximum divisor of `n` (not equal to `n`).

### Key points from the problem description:
1. If `n = 2`, the tax should be `1` (the only divisor not equal to `n`).
2. For composite numbers (like `n = 4`), the tax should be the maximum divisor of `n` that is less than `n`.
3. For prime numbers greater than `2`, the tax should be `n - 1`, since the only divisor is `1`.

### Review of the provided code:
1. **Function `func_7(n)`:** This function checks if `n` is prime. However, the logic in this function is incorrect:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5 + 100)):` is flawed; particularly, the `+ 100` part is unnecessary and could result in incorrect behavior for larger numbers.
   - The return statement `return False` indicates that `n` is not prime, but it does not correctly identify prime numbers due to the flawed loop.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The check `if func_7(n):` is supposed to determine if `n` is prime. If it is, the output is `1`, which is correct for `n = 2` but incorrect for any other prime number.
   - The check `elif n % 2 == 0:` correctly returns `2` for even `n` greater than `2`.
   - The check `elif func_7(n - 2):` intends to check if `n - 2` is prime, but this does not align with the problem statement correctly.
   - The final `else` returns `3`, which is not always correct. For example, if `n = 9`, the output should be `3` (since the maximum divisor of `9` is `3`), but if the input is a non-prime odd number, it may not be handled correctly.

### Potential Case Where Program Fails:
- For `n = 3`, the output should be `2` (as he can pay for `2` and `1`, but since `1` is not allowed, he pays tax on `3` which is 2). However, the program will output `1` due to the incorrect prime check, which is wrong.
- For `n = 5`, the output should be `4`, but the program will output `1` incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle certain cases correctly, particularly for prime numbers greater than `2` and odd composite numbers.

Correctness: **False**
