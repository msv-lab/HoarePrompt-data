To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
Mr. Funt has a total income `n` and needs to pay a tax based on the maximum divisor of `n` (not equal to `n`). The goal is to minimize the tax by splitting `n` into parts, where each part must be at least 2.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code contains several functions, but primarily we need to focus on how the tax is calculated based on the maximum divisor of `n`.

1. **Function 1 - `func_1`**: Reads input as a string.
2. **Function 2 - `func_2`**: Reads input and converts it to an integer.
3. **Function 3 - `func_3`**: Reads multiple integers from input.
4. **Function 4 - `func_4`**: Returns a list of integers from input.
5. **Function 5 - `func_5`**: Writes an integer to standard output.
6. **Function 6 - `func_6`**: Computes the product of a list of integers (not relevant to the tax calculation).
7. **Function 7 - `func_7`**: Checks if a number `n` is prime.

### Issues Identified:
- **Function 7** is supposed to identify if `n` is prime, but it has a logical flaw:
  - It does not correctly identify the maximum divisor of `n`. The condition `if n % i == 0 and n != i` incorrectly returns `False` if a divisor is found, which does not fulfill the requirement of finding the maximum divisor.
  - The loop's upper limit (`int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`) is arbitrary and could lead to incorrect behavior.
  
- The problem requires finding the maximum divisor of `n` that is less than `n` itself, not merely checking for primality.

### Example Cases:
1. For `n = 4`: The maximum divisor is `2`, and the expected output is `2`. The code does not calculate this.
2. For `n = 27`: The maximum divisor is `9`, and the expected output is `9`. The code does not calculate this either.

### Conclusion:
The program does not implement the required logic to calculate the tax based on the maximum divisor of `n`. The function to identify prime numbers does not return the maximum divisor, which is essential for calculating the tax correctly according to the problem description.

Thus, we conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
