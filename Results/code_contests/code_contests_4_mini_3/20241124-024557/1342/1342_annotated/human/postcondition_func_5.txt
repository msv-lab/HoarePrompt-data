The function accepts a list of numerical items and returns the product of all items in the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `SyntaxError` due to the usage of `eval` on an empty string. The expected behavior of returning a product is not handled correctly in case of an empty list, which should ideally return 1 (the multiplicative identity). Thus, it does not behave as the annotations suggest.
