The function accepts an integer `n`. It returns `False` if `n` is an even integer greater than 2. If `n` is equal to 2, it does not return anything (implicitly returns None). If `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, it checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 to `sqrt(n) + 100`. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime. If `n` is less than 2, the function does not enter the loop and implicitly returns None.
