According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than the upper limit, which is `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. We need to determine the upper limit based on the value of `n`.

1. Since `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), the smallest possible value for `n` is 2, which gives us an upper limit of \(int(2 ** 0.5 + 100) = int(1.414 + 100) = 101\).
2. For any value of `n` larger than 2, the upper limit must be recalculated. However, since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the upper limit will always be greater than 101 as long as \(n > 2\).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and we need to ensure that `i` is less than the upper limit. If `n` is exactly 2, the upper limit is 101, thus `i` can increment to 3. If `n` is greater than 2, the upper limit will also be greater than 101, allowing `i` to continue incrementing.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to 3. The upper limit will remain as is since it depends on `n` and the current value of `i` does not affect `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `i` is 3**
