According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit specified in the `range` function, which is `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 2.

At the end of the last iteration, we do not know the exact value of `i`, but we know that it must be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to determine the condition under which `i` can be incremented.

Assuming the last value of `i` was `k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. If `i` is currently at `k`, it will increment to `k + 1` for the next iteration. Hence, we need to adjust the state of `i` to `k + 1` and ensure that `k + 1` is still less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.

Since we don't have the exact current value of `i`, we simply state it in terms of `n`:

1. `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.
2. After the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Thus, we can express the adjusted states for the next iteration as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `i` is less than int(n ** 0.5 + 100)**
