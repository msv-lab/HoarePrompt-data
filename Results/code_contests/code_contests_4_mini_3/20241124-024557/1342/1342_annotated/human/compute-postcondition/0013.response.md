The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\). 

- Case 1: If `n` is an even integer greater than 2, the function returns `False`. If `n` is equal to 2, the function does not execute any return statement and will not return anything. If `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function checks for divisibility and will return `False` if a divisor is found; if no divisors are found, it indicates that `n` is prime and the function will return `True`.
  
- Case 2: The function returns `True` if `n` is determined to be prime (no divisors other than 1 and itself).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` and determine if it is a prime number, returning `False` for even integers greater than 2, and returning `True` if no divisors are found for odd integers greater than 2. If `n` is equal to 2, it does not return anything. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, returns `False` if `n` is an even integer greater than 2, and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer greater than 2 and is prime. If `n` is equal to 2, it does not return anything.**
