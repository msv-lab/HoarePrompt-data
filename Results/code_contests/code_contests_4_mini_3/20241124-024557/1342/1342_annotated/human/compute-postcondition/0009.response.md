Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, and `i` is an integer less than `n`. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value. This covers the case where `i` could be any integer from 1 to `n-1`, ensuring that if `i` is a divisor of `n` other than itself, the function will indicate that by returning False.***
