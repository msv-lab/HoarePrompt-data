According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer less than `n`, and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\). Since the loop starts with `i` at 2 and goes up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the next value it will take in the upcoming iteration, which would be `i + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to its next value. We do not need to adjust `n`, as it remains constant and within the specified bounds.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `i` is now `i + 1`**
