According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will start iterating with `i` initialized to 2 and will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), we can determine the starting state of `i` and the condition for the loop to execute.

1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 2.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.
3. Given the constraints on `n`, we can calculate the minimum value of `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`:
   - For the minimum value of `n` (which is 2), \(int(n ** 0.5 + 100) = int(\sqrt{2} + 100) = int(1.414 + 100) = 101\).
   - For the maximum value of `n` (which is \(2 \cdot 10^9\)), \(int(n ** 0.5 + 100) = int(\sqrt{2 \cdot 10^9} + 100) = int(44721.359 + 100) = 44821\).

Thus, the loop will execute if \(i\) starts at 2 and is less than 101 when \(n\) is at its minimum, and up to 44821 when \(n\) is at its maximum. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need:

- `n` must be at least 2 (which is already given).
- `i` is initialized to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, `i` is 2**
