The function accepts input for two integers, `a` and `b`, where `a` represents the number of TV prices and `b` specifies the number of lowest prices to be summed. It then reads a list of prices, sorts them, and prints the negative sum of the lowest `b` prices. The function does not handle cases where the input may be invalid (e.g., if fewer prices are provided than expected) or if `b` is greater than `a`. Additionally, it uses `raw_input()`, which is only applicable in Python 2, and may raise errors if executed in a Python 3 environment.
