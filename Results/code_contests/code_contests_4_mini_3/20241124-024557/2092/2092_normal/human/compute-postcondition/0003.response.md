The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by the absence of parameters in the definition. However, it operates on certain constraints provided: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and `ai` are integers representing TV set prices with values between -1000 and 1000 for each price.

Given the constraints and relationships, the output of the function is determined by the values of `n`, `m`, and the list of prices `ai`. The specific return value depends on the implementation details, which are not provided. 

Based on the information, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a fixed set of inputs related to TV set prices, returning results based on the integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), non-negative integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and integer prices `ai` (-1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000 for each price).**
