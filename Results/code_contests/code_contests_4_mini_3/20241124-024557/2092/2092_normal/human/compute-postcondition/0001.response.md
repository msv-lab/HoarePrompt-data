The code snippet `a, b = r()` is unpacking the result of the lambda function `r()`, which reads input and maps it to integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and `n`. The values of `a` and `b` will be determined by the output of the lambda function `r()`, which is not specified here, but they will be integers.

Since `r()` will return a tuple of two integers, `a` and `b` will be assigned those values. The previous values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the values of `a` and `b` will be based on the input processed by `r()`. 

Therefore, the output state will be dependent on the input values returned by `r()`, but we can summarize the impact as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` and `b` are integers returned by the lambda function `r()`**.
