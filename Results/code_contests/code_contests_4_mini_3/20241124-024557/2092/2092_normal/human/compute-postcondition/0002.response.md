To analyze the provided code snippet, we start by understanding the initial state and the impact of the code execution.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- `m` is a non-negative integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq n \)
- `a` and `b` are integers returned by the lambda function `r()`

The code snippet provided is:
```
print - sum(sorted(r())[:b])
```

1. `r()` is executed, returning two integers `a` and `b`. We focus on the value of `b`.
2. The function `sorted(r())` sorts the list of integers returned by `r()`, which includes `a` and potentially other integers depending on the implementation of `r()`.
3. The expression `sorted(r())[:b]` takes the first `b` elements from the sorted list.
4. The `sum(...)` function computes the sum of these first `b` elements.
5. The negative of this sum is printed.

Since `b` is provided as part of the output of the lambda function `r()`, it is guaranteed to be a valid integer such that \( 1 \leq b \leq n \).

The output state will reflect the variables' values as well as the calculated result of the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` and `b` are integers returned by the lambda function `r()`; the output is -sum(sorted(r())[:b]**)
