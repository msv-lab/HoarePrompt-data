The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts those parts into integers. The initial state of the variables `n`, `m`, and `ai` is not directly affected by this lambda function, as it does not execute any computations or assignments. Instead, it prepares to process input.

Since `r` is set to a function and no values have been assigned or returned yet, the output state reflects the presence of the lambda function without altering the existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and `ai` are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000 for each TV set price; `r` is a lambda function that reads input and maps it to integers.**
