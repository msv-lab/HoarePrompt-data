The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the output of the lambda function `r()`. Since `r()` is responsible for input conversion, the exact values of `a` and `b` are unknown, but they will hold the results of the function's execution. The initial values of `n` and `m` are not affected, and no explicit calculations are performed that alter them. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `a` and `b` based on the execution of `r()`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `a` and `b` are assigned from the output of the lambda function `r()`**.
