To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

1. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer in the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `m` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from the output of the lambda function `r()`, but the specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided.

2. The code executes `print - sum(sorted(r())[:b])`. This involves the following steps:
   - The function `r()` is called, and it returns a list of values.
   - The returned list from `r()` is then sorted in ascending order.
   - The first `b` elements of this sorted list are selected using slicing `[:b]`.
   - The sum of those selected elements is calculated.
   - Finally, the negative of that sum is printed.

3. Since `a` and `b` are derived from `r()`, we can't determine their specific values without knowing the output of `r()`. However, we know that `b` is a positive integer and cannot exceed `m`, which itself cannot exceed `n`.

Given that the values of `a` and `b` are not explicitly defined, we state the impact of the code without specifying exact numerical results.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `a` and `b` are derived from the output of the lambda function r(); the expression prints the negative sum of the first b elements from the sorted output of r()**.
