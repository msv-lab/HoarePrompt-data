The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on the constraints provided, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and the prices of TV sets are represented as a list of integers, with each price `ai` satisfying -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000. 

Based on the output conditions, the function will have different return scenarios which are not explicitly detailed. However, it will return values based on the descriptions of `n`, `m`, and the list of prices.

Since the specific return values based on the parameters are not provided, I will summarize the expected functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on internal constraints where `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and prices are a list of integers. The function will return values based on the given prices and the relationship between `n` and `m`.**
