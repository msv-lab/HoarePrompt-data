The code defines a lambda function `r` that uses `map` to convert space-separated input from `raw_input()` into integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and the list of prices are not directly affected by this line of code; rather, it prepares for inputting data. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and the list of prices, along with the definition of the new lambda function.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and the prices of the TV sets are a list of integers with each price ai satisfying -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000; `r` is a lambda function for input conversion.**
