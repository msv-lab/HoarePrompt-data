The function accepts no parameters directly but reads input from the user. It expects the user to enter two integers, `a` and `b`, followed by a list of integers. It then calculates the sum of the smallest `b` integers from the list and returns the negative of that sum. The function does not handle edge cases such as insufficient input elements or invalid input types.
