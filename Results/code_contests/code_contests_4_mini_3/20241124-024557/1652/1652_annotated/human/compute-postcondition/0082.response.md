The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, where `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. The initial state does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d**
