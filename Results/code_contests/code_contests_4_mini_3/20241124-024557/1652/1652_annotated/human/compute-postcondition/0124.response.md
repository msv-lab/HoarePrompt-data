Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1, `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, and `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the current one. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
