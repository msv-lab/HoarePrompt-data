Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128. If `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` is created from input values, and the first two integers are assigned to `a` and `b`, ensuring `a` is less than or equal to `b`. The values of `a` and `b` may be updated based on the divisibility conditions of subsequent integers in `list_divisors`. After processing, the final values of `a` and `b` are outputted in the format '%d %d\n'. If `idx` is equal to 0, the program does not execute the if block and therefore does not produce any output.***
