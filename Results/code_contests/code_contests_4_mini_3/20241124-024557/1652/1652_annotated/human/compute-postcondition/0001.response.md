`idx` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n`, the list of divisors, and `nb_test` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; the list of divisors contains `n` integers; `nb_test` is 0; `idx` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; the list of divisors contains `n` integers; `nb_test` is 0; `idx` is 0**
