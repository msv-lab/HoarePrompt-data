According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 2, which means that the last iteration processed the element at index `idx`, and the next element to be processed will be at index `idx + 1`, which is the length of `list_divisors` minus 1.

Since `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 5 elements. The current iteration would be processing the element at index `idx`, which is `length of list_divisors - 2`. Therefore, after the last iteration, for the loop to continue, `d` must be the next element in the list, which would be `list_divisors[length of list_divisors - 1]`.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, and `d` should be the next element in the list after the last one processed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1, and `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers with at least 5 elements.**
