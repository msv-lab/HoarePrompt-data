According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 3, which indicates that `d` is set to the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` needs to be incremented to 4, and `d` must be updated to the sixth integer in `list_divisors`.

Given that `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, we need to ensure that it contains at least 6 integers for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the conditions that need to be adjusted are:

1. `list_divisors` must contain at least 6 integers.
2. `idx` must be incremented to 4.
3. `d` must be updated to the sixth integer in `list_divisors`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 6 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 4, `d` is the sixth integer in `list_divisors`**
