Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`, while `b` remains the second integer from `list_divisors`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is not divisible by `b`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, then `a` retains its original value, maintaining the conditions of `d` with respect to `b`. The values of `d`, `a`, and `b` will be consistent with the precondition throughout the execution.***
