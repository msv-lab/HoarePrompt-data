The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors` and its value is defined, `a` takes on that specific value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `a` to the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.**
