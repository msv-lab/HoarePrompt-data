Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these updates, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. In all cases, `d` is less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a` when these conditions are satisfied.***
