Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is greater than or equal to 1, if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, then `a` remains the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`. In all cases, `d` retains its original value and properties as specified in the precondition, and `b` is equal to or greater than `a`.***
