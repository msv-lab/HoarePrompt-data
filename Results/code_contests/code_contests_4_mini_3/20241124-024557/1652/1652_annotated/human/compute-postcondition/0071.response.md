The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is given as the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, `b` will hold that specific integer value. The states of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.**
