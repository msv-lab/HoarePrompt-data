The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. The initial state specifies that `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and is divisible by `b`, but does not provide specific values for `b` or `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `b` has been updated to the value of `d`, but the exact values of `b` and `d` are not known. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values, `idx` is now `idx + 1`, `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `b` is now equal to `d`.**
