Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is not equal to 0. If `idx` is not 0, then `a` is assigned the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `b` is assigned the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`. The program processes the remaining integers in `list_divisors`, updating `a` and `b` based on their divisibility and values. After execution, the final values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `nb_test` remains 0, these values are printed without any modification from the initial assignment. Edge cases include handling when `list_divisors` has fewer than 3 integers which will not enter the if block, and ensuring that the program behaves correctly even if `a` and `b` are initially equal or if all divisors in `list_divisors` are less than `a`.***
