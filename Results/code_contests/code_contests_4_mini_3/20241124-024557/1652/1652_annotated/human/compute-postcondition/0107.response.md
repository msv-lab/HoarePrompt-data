Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values, `idx` is now `idx + 1`, `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by the previous value of `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If neither condition holds, `a` remains unchanged while `b` retains its value. In all cases, `d` is greater than or equal to the final value of `b`.***
