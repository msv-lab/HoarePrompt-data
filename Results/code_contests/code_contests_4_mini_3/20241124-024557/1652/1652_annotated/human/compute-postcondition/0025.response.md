The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 2. Since `d` holds a specific integer value from `list_divisors`, the value of `b` will be that integer. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and `b` is the same as `d`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and `b` is the same as `d`**.
