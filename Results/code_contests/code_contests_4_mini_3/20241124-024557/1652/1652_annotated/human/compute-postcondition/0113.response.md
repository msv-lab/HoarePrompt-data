Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`, while `b` remains unchanged, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements. Additionally, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`.***
