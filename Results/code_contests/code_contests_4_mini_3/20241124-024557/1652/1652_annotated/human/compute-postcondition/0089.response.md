Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is set to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is set to `d`. After these checks, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if it is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. In all cases, if `d` is less than `a`, `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the final values of `a` and `b` depend on the comparisons and divisibility conditions involving `d`, while ensuring that no values fall outside their defined boundaries.***
