Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, and `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, if `a` is greater than `b`, they are swapped; otherwise, they remain unchanged. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; if not, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
