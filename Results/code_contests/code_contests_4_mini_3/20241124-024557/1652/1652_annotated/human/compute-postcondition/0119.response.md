Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1, `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, `a` retains its original value.***
