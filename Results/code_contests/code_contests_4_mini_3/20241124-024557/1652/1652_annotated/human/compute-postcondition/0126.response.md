According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2) onwards. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `list_divisors` beyond index 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1, meaning it is pointing to the last element of the list. Since `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, the minimum value of `idx` is 2, indicating that the loop has processed the first two elements (indices 0 and 1).

For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more element in `list_divisors` after the current `idx`. Therefore, `idx` should be updated to reflect that it has processed the last element, and the length of `list_divisors` must be greater than `idx`.

Thus, the value of `idx` needs to be increased by 1, and `list_divisors` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 2, and `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 4 elements.**
