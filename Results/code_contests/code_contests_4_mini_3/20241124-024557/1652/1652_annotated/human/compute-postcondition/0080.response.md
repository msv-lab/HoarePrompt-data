To determine the adjustments needed for the states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the information provided step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, which means it starts from the third element (index 2) of the `list_divisors`. The loop will execute as long as there are more elements in `list_divisors` starting from index 2.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 128 \)
   - `nb_test` is 0
   - `idx` is not equal to 0
   - `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers
   - `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`

3. **Next Iteration**: 
   - Since `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, it means there are at least 4 integers in `list_divisors`.
   - The loop will access subsequent elements in `list_divisors` during the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 5 integers so that there is a fifth integer available to assign to `d`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - To allow for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `list_divisors` has at least 5 integers. 
   - Additionally, since `d` is currently the fourth integer, in the next iteration, `d` will need to be updated to the fifth integer in the list.

Thus, the adjustments to the state should reflect that `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers and that `d` is the fifth integer in the `list_divisors`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`.**
