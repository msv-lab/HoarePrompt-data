The code assigns the result of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))` to `list_divisors`. This means that `list_divisors` will become an iterable of integers derived from the stripped line of input split by spaces. The values of `a` and `b`, which are the first two integers from `list_divisors`, will be assigned based on the first two values produced by this mapping. The initial variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged in terms of their specified ranges and relationships, but `idx` has already been increased by 1. Thus, the output state reflects the new iterable and the conditions of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `a` and `b` are the first two integers from `list_divisors`; `idx` is increased by 1, and `list_divisors` is now an iterable of integers from the input line.**
