Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1, `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
