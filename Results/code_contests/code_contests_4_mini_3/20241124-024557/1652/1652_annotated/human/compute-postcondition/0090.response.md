According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the slice `list_divisors[2:]`, which starts from the third element of `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, the current value of `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`, and we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. 

To check this, we need to consider the following:
- The existing state indicates that `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, meaning there are at least 5 elements available.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must contain at least 6 elements, so that `d` can take the value of the sixth integer.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `list_divisors` has at least 6 elements. The current value of `d` (the fifth integer) will not change, as we are not modifying its position, but we need to prepare for the next value of `d`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 6 integers, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`.**
