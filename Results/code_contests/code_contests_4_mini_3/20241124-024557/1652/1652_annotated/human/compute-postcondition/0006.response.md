The values of `a` and `b` are swapped based on the condition. The previous values of `a` and `b` are `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, respectively. If `a` is greater than `b`, they are swapped; otherwise, they remain in the same order. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible values of `a` and `b` after the conditional assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers from input, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`**
