According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lines to read from `sys.stdin`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` has been increased by 1. The condition that `idx` is not equal to 0 does not affect whether the loop can execute again. Instead, we need to confirm the state of `sys.stdin` to determine if there are any more lines to read.

Since the specific line read from `sys.stdin` during the last iteration is not provided, we cannot make assumptions about its content or state. However, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more line available to read from `sys.stdin`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `sys.stdin` has more lines available to read. We can represent the state indicating that there is at least one more line.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, and there is at least one more line in `sys.stdin`**
