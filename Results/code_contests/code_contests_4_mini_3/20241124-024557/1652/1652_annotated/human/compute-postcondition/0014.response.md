Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and not divisible by `b`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, `a` remains the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`. In either case, `d` retains its original value and properties as specified in the precondition.***
