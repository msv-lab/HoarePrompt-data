The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `idx` is unknown. Since there is no condition to check or output statement following this increment, the output state reflects the change to `idx`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `list_divisors`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: variable `idx` is increased by 1.

Output State: **variable `idx` is increased by 1**
