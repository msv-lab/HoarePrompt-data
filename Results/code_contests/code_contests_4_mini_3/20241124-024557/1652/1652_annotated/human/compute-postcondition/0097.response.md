The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements from `list_divisors`, which is an iterable of integers obtained from the input line. Since `list_divisors` is populated with values from the input, `a` and `b` will have specific values based on the first two integers in that iterable. The initial state of `n`, `idx`, and the remaining values in `list_divisors` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `a` is the first integer from `list_divisors`; `b` is the second integer from `list_divisors`; `idx` is increased by 1; `list_divisors` is now an iterable of integers from the input line.**
