Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, then the value of `a` remains unchanged and continues to satisfy `a` as the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`.***
