Postcondition: ***If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` also remains unchanged. Thus, after the execution, `a` is either unchanged or set to the value of `d` depending on the divisibility condition.***
