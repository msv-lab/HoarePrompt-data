Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1, and `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, they remain unchanged. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all other cases, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The conditions ensure that all possible scenarios concerning the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `d` are accounted for.***
