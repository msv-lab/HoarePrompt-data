According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more element in `list_divisors` beyond the current index `idx`.

At the end of the last iteration, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, and `idx` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that the loop has already processed at least the first two elements of the list. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the minimum size of the `list_divisors` is 3, but since we are starting from index 2, we need at least one more divisor to continue the loop.

To adjust the states accordingly, we need to ensure:
- `list_divisors` must contain at least 4 integers for the loop to execute again (the third index plus one more).
- `d` should be the next integer in the `list_divisors` starting from index 2, which would be the fourth integer (index 3).

Thus, the adjusted states are:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`**
