The value of `b` is assigned the value of `d`. The variable `d` is defined as the next element in `list_divisors` after the current one, and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements. Therefore, the value of `b` will be equal to the value of `d`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1, `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, `b` is equal to the value of `d`**.
