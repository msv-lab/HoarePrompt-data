Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, and `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, or if `d` is less than `a`, then `a` remains unchanged. Thus, after execution, if `d` meets the divisibility conditions, `a` or `b` may be updated to `d`, otherwise their values remain the same or are swapped depending on their relative sizes.***
