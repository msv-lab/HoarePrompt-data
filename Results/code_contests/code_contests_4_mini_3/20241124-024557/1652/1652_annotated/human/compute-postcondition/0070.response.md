To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop structure.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). This implies that the loop will execute for elements at indices 2 and higher.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, which means the current index of the last element accessed in the previous iteration is 2 or higher.
   - Since `idx` is not equal to 0, it suggests that the loop has already processed at least two elements from `list_divisors`.

3. **Determining the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `list_divisors` after the current element being processed (which would be the element at index 2).
   - We need to ensure that `d` will represent the next element in `list_divisors`, which means we need to adjust the index accordingly.

4. **Adjusting the Conditions**:
   - If the current index corresponds to the last element, we need to ensure that `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers so that the next iteration can access the element at index 3.
   - The loop will only run again if there are more elements to iterate over.

Thus, to summarize:

- The state of `list_divisors` must be adjusted to contain at least 4 integers.
- The value of `d` should be set to represent the next element in `list_divisors`, which would be the element at index 3.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted state is as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`**
