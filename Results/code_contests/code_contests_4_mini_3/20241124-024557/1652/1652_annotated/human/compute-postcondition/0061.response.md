Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d` while `b` remains unchanged. If neither condition is met, `a` retains its original value and `b` remains as the second integer from `list_divisors`, ensuring that `d` remains greater than or equal to `b` throughout the execution. All relationships and constraints from the precondition are maintained.***
