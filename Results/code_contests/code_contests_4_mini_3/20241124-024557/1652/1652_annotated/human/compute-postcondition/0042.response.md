Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` also remains unchanged.***
