According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, meaning the range for `d` starts from the third element. 

Since `idx` has been incremented by 1, we can infer that `d` is currently the element at `list_divisors[idx]`, which corresponds to the element at the current index of the loop execution. For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` needs to be less than the length of `list_divisors` minus 1 because we are slicing the list starting from index 2. Therefore, `idx` needs to be updated to reflect that it will point to the next element that will be iterated in the next iteration.

Thus, `idx` should be adjusted to be equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1 to ensure there is at least one more element for `d` to take. The variable `d` will then be assigned to the next value in `list_divisors`, which will be `list_divisors[idx + 1]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 1, `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the current one.**
