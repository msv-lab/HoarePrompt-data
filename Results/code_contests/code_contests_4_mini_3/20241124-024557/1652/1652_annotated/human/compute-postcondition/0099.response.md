According to the code, the loop will iterate over the elements in `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). For the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must contain at least three elements, meaning its length must be at least 3. 

Since `idx` is increased by 1 before the loop, it is now `idx + 1`. Therefore, I do not need to modify `idx` for the loop execution, but it is important to note that `idx` will represent the index of the second element in `list_divisors` after the increment.

To summarize, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are that `list_divisors` should contain at least 3 elements (so that `list_divisors[2]` exists), and the states of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop execution as long as they are swapped or not according to their initial values.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values, `idx` is now `idx + 1`, `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements**
