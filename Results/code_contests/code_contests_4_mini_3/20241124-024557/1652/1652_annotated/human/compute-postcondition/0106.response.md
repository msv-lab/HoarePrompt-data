Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `a` is equal to `d` if `d` is divisible by the previous value of `a`. The values of `b` are either swapped or remain the same, `idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is not divisible by `b`.***
