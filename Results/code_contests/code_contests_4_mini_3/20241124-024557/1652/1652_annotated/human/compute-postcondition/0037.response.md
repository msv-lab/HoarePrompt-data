Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and if `d` (the fifth integer in `list_divisors`) is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
