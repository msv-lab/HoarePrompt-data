Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 2, and `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers with at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`, but if `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. After evaluating the conditions, `a` and `b` may be swapped based on their values, ensuring that `a` is less than or equal to `b` after this block executes. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is updated if `d` is divisible by `a`; otherwise, both variables remain unchanged. Thus, `a` and `b` reflect their updated values based on the conditions evaluated.***
