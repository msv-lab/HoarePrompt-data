`b` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is known to be the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, and `b` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, and `b` is equal to `d.**
