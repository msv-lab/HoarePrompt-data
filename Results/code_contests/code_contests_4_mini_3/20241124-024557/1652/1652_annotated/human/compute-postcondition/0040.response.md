`a` is assigned the value of `d`, where `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. The values of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `a` is equal to the fifth integer in `list_divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `a` is equal to the fifth integer in `list_divisors`.**
