Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`, if `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After that, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The conditions ensure that `a` and `b` are appropriately updated based on the value of `d` while adhering to the stated relationships.***
