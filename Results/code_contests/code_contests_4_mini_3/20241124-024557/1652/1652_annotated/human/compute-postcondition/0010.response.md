The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. Given that `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and is divisible by `b`, this means that the value of `b` will now be equal to `d` and will still satisfy the condition `d >= b`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and now `b` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is equal to `d`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`.**
