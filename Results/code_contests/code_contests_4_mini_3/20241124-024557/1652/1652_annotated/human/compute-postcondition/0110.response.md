Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values, `idx` is now `idx + 1`, `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`.***
