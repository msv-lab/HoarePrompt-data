The code assigns the values from a line of input to `list_divisors` by splitting the input string into individual components, stripping any whitespace, and converting each component into an integer. The exact values of `list_divisors` depend on the input provided in `sys.stdin`, but it will contain `n` integers as stated in the initial conditions. Other variables (`n`, `nb_test`, and `idx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers from input, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
