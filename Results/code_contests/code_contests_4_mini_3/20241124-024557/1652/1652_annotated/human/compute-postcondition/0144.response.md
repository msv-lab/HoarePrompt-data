Functionality: ** The function reads multiple lines of integers from standard input, where each line represents a set of divisors. It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, with the first two integers from each line, ensuring `a` is less than or equal to `b`. It then processes any additional integers in the line, updating `a` and `b` based on divisibility conditions. It outputs the final values of `a` and `b` for each line of input. If no input is provided (i.e., `idx` is 0), the function does not execute the loop, and no output is produced. The function does not explicitly handle the case where fewer than two integers are provided in a line.**
