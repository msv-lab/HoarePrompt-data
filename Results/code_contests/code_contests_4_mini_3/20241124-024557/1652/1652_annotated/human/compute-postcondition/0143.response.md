The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of integers `divisors`. The integer `n` must meet the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, and the list `divisors` contains exactly `n` integers, each of which is a divisor of either `x` or `y`, with values ranging from 1 to 10^4. The function returns a collection of results based on the divisors. The specific outputs depend on the values of `x` and `y`, which are not defined in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integer `divisors` and return results based on the divisors' relationship to the values of `x` and `y`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `divisors`, returning results based on the relationship of the divisors with the values of `x` and `y`.**
