Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain unchanged. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged and `b` retains its original value. In summary, the values of `a` and `b` may be updated based on the divisibility conditions and may be swapped based on their relative sizes.***
