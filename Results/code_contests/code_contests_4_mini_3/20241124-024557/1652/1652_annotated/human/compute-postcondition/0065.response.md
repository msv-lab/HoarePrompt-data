Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `a` and `b` are the first two integers from `list_divisors` after they may have been swapped, the value of `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0`).***
