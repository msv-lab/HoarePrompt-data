The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The previous value of `d` is known to be greater than or equal to `b`, not divisible by `b`, and divisible by `a`. However, since `a` is now being set to the value of `d`, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` now takes the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `a` is now equal to `d`, `b` is the second integer from `list_divisors`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by the previous value of `a`.**
