Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `d` is less than `b`, and `a` and `b` are the first two integers from `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged while `b` retains its original value.
