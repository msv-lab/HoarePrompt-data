The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is already defined as being between `a` and `b`, the new value of `a` will now be equal to `d`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is now equal to `d`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is now equal to `d`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`.**
