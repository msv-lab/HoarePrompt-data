The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the first two elements of `list_divisors`. The initial values of `list_divisors` are unknown but it contains a mapped object of integers from the input line. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` and `b` now hold these values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains a mapped object of integers, `a` and `b` are assigned the values of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]**.
