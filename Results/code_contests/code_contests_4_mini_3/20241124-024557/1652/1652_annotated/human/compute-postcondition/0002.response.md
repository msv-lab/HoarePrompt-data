According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is input available to read. Since `nb_test` is 0 at the start, it indicates no tests have been processed yet, and `idx` is 0, which means we are at the beginning of any indexing we might be using. 

For the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one line of input in `sys.stdin`. Therefore, we can adjust the state to reflect that input is available.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, the list of divisors contains `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, and there is at least one line of input in `sys.stdin`**
