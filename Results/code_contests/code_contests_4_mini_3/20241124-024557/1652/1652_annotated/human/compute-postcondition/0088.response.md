Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, then the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, `a` remains unchanged as well.***
