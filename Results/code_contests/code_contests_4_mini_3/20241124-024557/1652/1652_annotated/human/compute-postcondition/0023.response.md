Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is greater than or equal to 1. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. Regardless of the updates, `a` and `b` are assigned based on their relative sizes. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `d` remain unchanged. All conditions ensure that `a` remains the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `b` remains the maximum of those two values.***
