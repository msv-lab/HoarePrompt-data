Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, and `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, the values of both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
