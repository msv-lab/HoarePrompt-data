Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is less than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged, ensuring it continues to satisfy the condition of being the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`. If `d` is less than `a`, the conditions of `a`, `b`, and `d` remain unchanged.***
