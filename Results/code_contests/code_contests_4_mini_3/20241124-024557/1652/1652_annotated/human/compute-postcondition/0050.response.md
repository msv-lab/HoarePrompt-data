The `list_divisors` variable is assigned the result of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))`. This means that `line`, which is read from `sys.stdin`, is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace and then split into a list of strings based on spaces. Each string is then converted into an integer by the `map` function. The previous state of `list_divisors` was not defined as it is a new assignment. Other variables (`n`, `nb_test`, `idx`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `list_divisors` now holds a mapped object of integers derived from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` contains a mapped object of integers from the input line.**
