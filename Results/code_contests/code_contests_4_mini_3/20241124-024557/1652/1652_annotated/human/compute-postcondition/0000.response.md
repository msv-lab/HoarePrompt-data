The variable `nb_test` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of `n` and the list of divisors remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128; the list of divisors contains n integers where each integer is a divisor of either x or y, with values ranging from 1 to 10^4; `nb_test` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128; the list of divisors contains n integers where each integer is a divisor of either x or y, with values ranging from 1 to 10^4; `nb_test` is 0**
