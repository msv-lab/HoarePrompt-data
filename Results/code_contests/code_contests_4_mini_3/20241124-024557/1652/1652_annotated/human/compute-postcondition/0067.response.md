Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The value of `b` remains the same throughout.***
