Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on their comparison: if `a > b`, then `a` becomes the previous value of `b` and `b` becomes the previous value of `a`; otherwise, they remain unchanged.**
