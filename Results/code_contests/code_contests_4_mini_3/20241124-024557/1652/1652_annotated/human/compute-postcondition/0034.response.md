According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from index 2. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 2, which indicates that the current value of `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `list_divisors` must contain more elements beyond the current index (i.e., it must have more than 4 integers). Since `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, it also needs to have at least 5 integers for the loop to continue. Consequently, `idx` should be incremented to 3 for the next iteration, and `d` should be updated to reflect the fifth integer in `list_divisors`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments must be made:
- `list_divisors` should contain at least 5 integers.
- `idx` should be 3.
- `d` should be the fifth integer in `list_divisors`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`.**
