According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue as long as there are more lines to read from the standard input. Since the variable `idx` is increased by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we can infer that `idx` was previously 0 and is now 1.

At the end of the last iteration, we do not have specific information about the number of lines remaining in `sys.stdin`. However, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more line available to read.

Since `idx` was incremented by 1, it should be adjusted to reflect the next line being read, which will be `idx` equal to 2. 

Therefore, we can summarize the necessary adjustments based on the information provided:

State: **`idx` is 2, there is at least one more line in sys.stdin**
