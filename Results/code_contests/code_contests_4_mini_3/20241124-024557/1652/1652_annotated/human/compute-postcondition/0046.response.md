Output State: **If `n` is at least 3 and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`; if `nb_test` remains 0, then the values of `a` and `b` are printed without any change.**
