The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `idx` is unknown. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `a` and `b` are the first two integers from `list_divisors`, ensuring `a` is less than or equal to `b`; `idx` is increased by 1.
