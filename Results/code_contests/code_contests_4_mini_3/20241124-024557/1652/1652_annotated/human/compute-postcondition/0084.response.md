Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers. If `d`, the fifth integer in `list_divisors`, is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` and is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is neither divisible by `b` nor `a`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
