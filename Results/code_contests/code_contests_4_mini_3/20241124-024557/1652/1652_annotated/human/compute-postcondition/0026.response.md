`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. Since the values of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` are not affected by this assignment, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and `a` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`**
