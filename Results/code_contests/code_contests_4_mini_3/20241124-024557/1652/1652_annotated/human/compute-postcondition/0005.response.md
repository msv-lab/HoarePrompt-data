The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements from `list_divisors`. Since `list_divisors` contains `n` integers from input, `a` will take the value of `list_divisors[0]` and `b` will take the value of `list_divisors[1]`. The variables `n`, `nb_test`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers from input, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is `list_divisors[1]`**
