Output State: **If `idx` is 0, the loop does not execute and `nb_test` remains 0, while `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128. If the loop executes at least once, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers; after the first execution, `a` and `b` are the first two integers from `list_divisors`, ensuring `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and `idx` is increased by 1. If the loop executes multiple times, `idx` increments with each loop iteration, and `a` and `b` may be updated based on the conditions in the inner loop, reflecting the divisibility and ordering logic applied to the integers in `list_divisors`.**
