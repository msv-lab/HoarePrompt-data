Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128. If `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` is updated with integers from the input line. The two variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first two integers from `list_divisors`, ensuring `a` is less than or equal to `b`. For each subsequent divisor `d` in `list_divisors`, if `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. The values of `a` and `b` may be swapped to maintain the condition `a ≤ b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but less than `b`, and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated. Finally, the program outputs the updated values of `a` and `b`, ensuring that they represent the largest divisors found in the `list_divisors` that meet the specified conditions.***
