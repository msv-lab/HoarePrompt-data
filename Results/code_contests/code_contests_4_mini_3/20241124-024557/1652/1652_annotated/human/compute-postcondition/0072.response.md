The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, which is confirmed to exist since `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, and `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, and `a` is equal to `d**
