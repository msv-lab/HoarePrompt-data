Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to the length of `list_divisors` minus 2, and `list_divisors` remains an iterable of integers with at least 4 elements. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
