According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue as long as there are more lines to read from the standard input. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` has been increased by 1, which indicates that the loop has processed one line of input. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more line available in `sys.stdin`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more line to read.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `a` and `b` are the first two integers from `list_divisors`, ensuring `a` is less than or equal to `b`; `idx` is increased by 1, and there is at least one more line in sys.stdin**
