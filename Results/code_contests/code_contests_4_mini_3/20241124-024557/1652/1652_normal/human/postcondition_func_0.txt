The function reads multiple lines of input where each line contains integers. It identifies the two smallest divisors from the provided integers, treating the first two as special cases for comparison, and returns them. If no lines are read, the function will not output anything, and the values of `a` and `b` remain undefined. The function does not specify what to do with invalid input or how to handle cases where fewer than two integers are provided.
