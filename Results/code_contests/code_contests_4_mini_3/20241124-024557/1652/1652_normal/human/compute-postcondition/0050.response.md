The code assigns the result of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))` to `list_divisors`. This means that `line` is expected to be a string containing space-separated integers, which are then split into a list of strings, converted to integers, and finally wrapped in a `map` object. Other variables like `n`, `divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx` are not affected by this line. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the change introduced by the `list_divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is the next index to be processed, `list_divisors` is a map object of integers converted from the space-separated string in `line`**
