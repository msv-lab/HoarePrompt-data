Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is incremented by the number of lines read from input. If no lines are read (empty input), the loop does not execute and `idx` remains 0. After executing, values of `a` and `b` depend on the divisors provided in the input; if `idx` is 0, `a` and `b` remain undefined. If the input is valid, `a` and `b` will be the two smallest divisors from the list.**
