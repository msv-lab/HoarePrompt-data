To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop.

1. **Understanding the loop**: The loop iterates over `list_divisors` starting from index 2, meaning `d` takes values from the third element onward. Given that `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, the current value of `d` is the fourth element.

2. **Current state**: 
   - `n` is at least 3 (this is not directly relevant for the loop).
   - `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements (the fourth element is currently assigned to `d`).
   - `nb_test` is 0 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `idx` is not equal to 0 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`.

3. **Next iteration requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be assigned to the next element in `list_divisors`, which means `list_divisors` must have at least 5 elements. Therefore, we need to ensure that `list_divisors` has an additional element after the current fourth element.

4. **Adjustment of states**: 
   - We need to make sure `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements.
   - `d` should be updated to the fifth element in `list_divisors`.
   - Since the loop variable `d` is updated at the beginning of each iteration, we should reflect that it will now take the value of the fifth element.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements.
- `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`.

Final state:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`.**
