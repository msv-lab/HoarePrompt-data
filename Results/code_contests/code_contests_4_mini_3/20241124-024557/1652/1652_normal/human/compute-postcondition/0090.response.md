According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over elements starting from the third element of the `list_divisors`, which means it will continue as long as there are more elements in the list after index 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 4, meaning that the loop has just processed the element at `list_divisors[4]`, and `d` is `divisors[4]`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are more elements in `list_divisors` after index 4.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements (which means it has at least 5 elements in total), we can conclude that `list_divisors` has more than 4 elements. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `idx` needs to be incremented to 5 and `d` should reference the next element in the list, which is `divisors[5]`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- Update `idx` to 5.
- Update `d` to `divisors[5]`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 6 elements, `idx` is 5, `a` is the minimum of `divisors[0]` and `divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `divisors[0]` and `divisors[1]`, `d` is `divisors[5]`.**
