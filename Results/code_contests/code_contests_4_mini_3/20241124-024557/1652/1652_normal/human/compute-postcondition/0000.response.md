The variable `nb_test` is initialized to 0. The initial state does not change the state of other variables, but now `nb_test` holds the value 0. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, the list of divisors contains n integers, and `nb_test` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, the list of divisors contains n integers, and `nb_test` is 0**.
