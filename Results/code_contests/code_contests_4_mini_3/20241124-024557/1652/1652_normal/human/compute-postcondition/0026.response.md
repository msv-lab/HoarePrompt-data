The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The variable `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, but its specific value is not provided. The values of the other variables (`n`, `list_divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now equal to `d`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is equal to `d` (the third element in `list_divisors)**
