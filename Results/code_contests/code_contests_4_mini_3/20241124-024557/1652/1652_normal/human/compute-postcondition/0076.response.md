The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is `list_divisors[3]`, which is the fourth element in the `list_divisors`. The previous value of `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`. 

Since `d` takes the value of `list_divisors[3]`, this means that `a` will now equal `list_divisors[3]`, while `b` and the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4; `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements; `idx` is 3; `a` is `list_divisors[3]` (previously the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`); `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`; `d` is `list_divisors[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4; `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements; `idx` is 3; `a` is `list_divisors[3]`; `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`; `d` is `list_divisors[3]**
