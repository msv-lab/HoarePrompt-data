The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the third element in `list_divisors`. The value of `d` is known and is not affected by the assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, `b` is equal to `d`**
