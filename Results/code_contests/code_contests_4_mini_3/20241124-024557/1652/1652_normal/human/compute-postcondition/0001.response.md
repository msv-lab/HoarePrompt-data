The code assigns the value 0 to `idx`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128), the list of divisors (which contains n integers), and `nb_test` (which is 0). The assignment does not change any of these values. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, the list of divisors contains n integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, the list of divisors contains n integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 0**
