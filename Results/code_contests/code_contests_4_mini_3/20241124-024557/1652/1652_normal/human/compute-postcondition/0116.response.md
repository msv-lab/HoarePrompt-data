According to the code, the loop will iterate over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the index 2. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in `list_divisors` beyond the current last index accessed in the previous iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `idx` is 1, indicating that the current index in the `list_divisors` is 2 (since the loop starts at index 2). Given that `list_divisors` is stated to be a list of at least 3 integers, the loop has already processed the elements at indices 0, 1, and 2. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `list_divisors` to have at least 4 integers so that the loop can access the element at index 3 for the next iteration. Additionally, the state of `d` should be updated to reflect the new value being processed, which will be the element at index 3.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- Ensure `list_divisors` has at least 4 integers.
- Set `d` to the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`**
