Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, and `d` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged as well.***
