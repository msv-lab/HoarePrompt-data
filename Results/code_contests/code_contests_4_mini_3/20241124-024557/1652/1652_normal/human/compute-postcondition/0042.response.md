Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` is also unchanged. Thus, the value of `a` will be either updated to `d` if the conditions are met or retain its original value otherwise.***
