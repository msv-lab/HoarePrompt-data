The code snippet assigns the value of `list_divisors` to the result of mapping the `int` function over the stripped and split elements of `line`. The initial state indicates that `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, and since `line` contains at least one line from `sys.stdin`, the mapping operation will produce a new iterable of integers based on the values in `line`.

Since the exact contents of `line` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific integers. However, we can state that `list_divisors` will be an iterable of integers derived from the input line.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the presence of `list_divisors` as a new iterable of integers corresponding to the input from `line`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers from line input.**
