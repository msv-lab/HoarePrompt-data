The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` if `a` is greater than `b`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, their values remain unchanged. 

The initial values of `a` and `b` are the first and second elements of `list_divisors`, respectively. Since the values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can only indicate that their values will be swapped if the condition `a > b` holds true.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128; `divisors` is a list of n integers; `nb_test` is 0; `idx` is an integer not equal to 0; `a` and `b` might be swapped depending on their initial values.**
