The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, and since `idx` is not equal to 0, it will take on a new value, which is `previous_value_of_idx + 1`. However, the exact previous value of `idx` is unknown. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `nb_test` also remains 0 because there has been no further processing of input according to the code provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `idx` while noting that the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is increased by 1**
