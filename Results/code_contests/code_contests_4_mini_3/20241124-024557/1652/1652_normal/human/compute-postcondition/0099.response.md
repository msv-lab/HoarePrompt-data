According to the code, the loop iterates over `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2) to the end of the list. For the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements, since it starts slicing from index 2.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, it implies that `list_divisors` should be populated with `n` integers. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3. 

Additionally, the state mentions that `idx` is incremented by 1, which suggests that it has already been updated from its previous value. Therefore, it should be set to its incremented value before the loop starts.

Considering these points, the adjusted states would be:
- `n` must be at least 3 (to ensure `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements).
- `idx` is now 1 (incremented by 1 from its previous value).
- `list_divisors` must contain at least 3 integers.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers**
