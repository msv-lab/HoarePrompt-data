According to the code, the loop iterates over lines from `sys.stdin`. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one line of input available from standard input. The variables `n`, `nb_test`, and `idx` do not directly influence the ability of the loop to execute, but we note their initial conditions. 

Since `nb_test` is initialized to 0, it reflects that no tests have been conducted yet, and `idx` is 0, which indicates that we are starting from the first line of input. However, we need to ensure that there is indeed input available to process.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we require that there is at least one line in `sys.stdin`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, and there is at least 1 line in sys.stdin**
