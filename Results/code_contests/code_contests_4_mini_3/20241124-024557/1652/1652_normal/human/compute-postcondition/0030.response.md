The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, which is known but not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `a` is assigned the value of `d**.
