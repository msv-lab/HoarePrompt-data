`a` is assigned the value of `d`, where `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `a` is equal to `d`.**
