Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`. If `d` (which is `list_divisors[3]`) is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If neither condition holds, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. This ensures that `a` or `b` reflects the value of `d` only when the respective divisibility conditions are satisfied.***
