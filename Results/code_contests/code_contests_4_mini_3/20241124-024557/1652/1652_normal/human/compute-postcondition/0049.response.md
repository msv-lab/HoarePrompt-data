According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lines to read from the standard input. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` has been increased by 1, indicating that the current index has moved forward. To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `idx` reflects the next line that will be read. 

Since we don't have specific information about the number of lines in `sys.stdin`, we cannot make assumptions about the termination condition. However, we can imply that if the loop is to execute again, `idx` should be set to its increased value to reflect the next input line.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is the next index to be processed**
