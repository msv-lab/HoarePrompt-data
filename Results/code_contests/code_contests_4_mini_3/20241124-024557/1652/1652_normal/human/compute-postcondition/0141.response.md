According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lines of input to read. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `idx` has been incremented by 1, which suggests that it was previously reading the current line of input.

Since the state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, and the loop is reading from `sys.stdin`, the number of lines in the input is not specified. However, for the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more line of input available to read.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that there is at least one more line of input available. The rest of the states do not need to be adjusted since they are not directly related to the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is incremented by 1, and there is at least one more line in sys.stdin**
