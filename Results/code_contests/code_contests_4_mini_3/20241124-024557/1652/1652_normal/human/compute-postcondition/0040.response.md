The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. The initial state mentions that `d` exists and has a specific value, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.**
