According to the code, the loop will execute for each element `d` in the sliced `list_divisors[2:]`, which means it will start from the third element of `list_divisors`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, so the slice `list_divisors[2:]` will contain at least 1 element (the third element). The variable `idx` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but is noted to be an integer not equal to 0.

Since we are focusing on the loop state, we need to consider the current state of `d` in relation to the length of `list_divisors`. Given that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` must have been assigned the value of the third element in the previous iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 4 elements so that the slice `list_divisors[2:]` still has elements beyond the current `d`. Thus, we need to state that `list_divisors` must now have at least 4 elements.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, which is the next element to be evaluated from the fourth element in the list.**
