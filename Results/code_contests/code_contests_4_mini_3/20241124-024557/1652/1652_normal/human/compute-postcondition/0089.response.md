Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `a` is the minimum of `divisors[0]` and `divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `divisors[0]` and `divisors[1]`, and `d` is `divisors[4]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In both cases, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` becomes greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. In all cases, if the conditions for updating `a` or `b` are not met, their values remain the same.***
