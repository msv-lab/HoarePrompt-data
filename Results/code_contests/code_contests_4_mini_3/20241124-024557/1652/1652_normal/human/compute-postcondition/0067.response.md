Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `d` is `list_divisors[2]`, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The relationship between `a`, `b`, and `d` is preserved, ensuring that `a` is less than or equal to `d` which is less than `b`.***
