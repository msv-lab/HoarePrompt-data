Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `a` is the minimum of `divisors[0]` and `divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `divisors[0]` and `divisors[1]`, and `d` is `divisors[4]`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
