Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is set to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is set to `d`. After that, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged if `d` does not meet the divisibility conditions. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
