The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is at least 3 and `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` will have a defined value from that list. Consequently, `a` will take on the value of `d`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.**
