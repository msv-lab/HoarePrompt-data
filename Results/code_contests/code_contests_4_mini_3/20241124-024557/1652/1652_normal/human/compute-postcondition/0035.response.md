The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, where `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. The value of `d` is determined from `list_divisors`, but since the specific value of `d` is not provided, we will denote it as it is. The other variables (`n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.**
