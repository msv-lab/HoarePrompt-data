Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is an integer not equal to 0. If `idx` is not 0, the program processes input from `sys.stdin`, mapping the first two integers from `divisors` to `a` and `b`, ensuring `a` is less than or equal to `b`. It then updates `a` and `b` based on the divisibility of subsequent integers in `divisors`, and finally, it outputs the values of `a` and `b`. If `idx` equals 0, then `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `nb_test` remains 0.***
