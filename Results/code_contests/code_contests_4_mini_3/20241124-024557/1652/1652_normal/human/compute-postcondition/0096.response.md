The `list_divisors` is assigned the result of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))`. This means that `line` is read from `sys.stdin`, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, and then split into a list of strings based on spaces. Each of these strings is then converted to an integer, resulting in `list_divisors` being a map object of integers.

The other variables (`n`, `divisors`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `list_divisors` is a map object of integers created from the input line.**
