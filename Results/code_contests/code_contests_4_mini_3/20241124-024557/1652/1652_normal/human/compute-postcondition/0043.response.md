Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. The values of `a` and `b` are then swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b`, but greater than or equal to `a`, and is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Thus, after the execution, `a` and `b` will reflect the updates based on the conditions checked against `d`.***
