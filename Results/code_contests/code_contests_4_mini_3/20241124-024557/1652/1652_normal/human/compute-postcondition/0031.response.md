Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.***
