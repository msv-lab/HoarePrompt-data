Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is the next index to be processed. If `idx` is not 0, `a` is the minimum and `b` is the maximum of the qualifying divisors from `list_divisors`, and the program outputs these values. The program accounts for cases where `a` and `b` can be updated based on the divisibility of the elements in `list_divisors` and ensures that `a` is always less than or equal to `b` at the end of processing. If `idx` is 0, no output is generated, and the state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged.***
