The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`. Since `d` is directly assigned to `a`, the value of `a` will be equal to that of `d`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`, and `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`, and `a` is equal to `d`**
