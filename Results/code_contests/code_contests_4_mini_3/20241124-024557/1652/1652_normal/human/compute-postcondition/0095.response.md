According to the code, the loop iterates over lines from standard input (`sys.stdin`). The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lines to read from the input. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` has been incremented by 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128. Since `idx` has been incremented, it indicates that the loop has processed one line of input.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more line available in standard input. The state of `n`, `divisors`, `nb_test`, `a`, and `b` does not need to change because they do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and there is at least one more line in sys.stdin**
