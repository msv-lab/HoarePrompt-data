To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, which means it will start from the third element of the `list_divisors`. For the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must have at least three elements (since we are skipping the first two).

2. The variable `n` is defined such that \(2 \leq n \leq 128\). This tells us that `n` is at least 2, which means `list_divisors` should have at least 2 elements. However, to ensure that there are at least three elements, `n` must be at least 3.

3. The variable `idx` is specified to be an integer not equal to 0, which does not have a direct impact on the loop execution but should be noted.

4. The variables `a` and `b` can be swapped depending on their initial values, which may affect the state of other computations but does not affect the loop's execution.

Given the above analysis, we can conclude that:
- `n` should be at least 3 for the loop to execute.
- The `list_divisors` should contain at least three integers.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0**
