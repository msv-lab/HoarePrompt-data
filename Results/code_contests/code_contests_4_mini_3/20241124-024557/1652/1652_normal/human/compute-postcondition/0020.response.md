`a` is assigned the value of `d`. Given the conditions, `d` is less than `b`, greater than or equal to `a`, and divisible by `a`. The value of `a` thus becomes equal to `d`, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and now `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` is equal to `d`**
