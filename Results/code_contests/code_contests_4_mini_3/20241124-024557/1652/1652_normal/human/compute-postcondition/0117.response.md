The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`. Since `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` has a defined value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`, `b` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`**
