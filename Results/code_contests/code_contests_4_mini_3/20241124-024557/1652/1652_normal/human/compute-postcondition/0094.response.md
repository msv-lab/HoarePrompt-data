The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` is not specified, but since it is stated that `idx` is the next index to be processed, it can be inferred that it was 0 or a positive integer. The output state does not generate any additional output or affect the values of `a` and `b` since no output conditions are met for `idx`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
