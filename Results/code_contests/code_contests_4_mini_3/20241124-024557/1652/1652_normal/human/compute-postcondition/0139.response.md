Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` has been incremented by 1. If `idx` is not 0, the first two elements of `list_divisors` are assigned to `a` and `b`, and their order is adjusted such that `a` is less than or equal to `b`. During the loop, for each divisor `d` in `list_divisors` starting from the third element, if `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, the function checks its divisibility with `b` and `a`, updating them if conditions are met. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, it checks its divisibility with `a` and updates `a` accordingly. After all applicable checks, `sys.stdout.write` outputs the final values of `a` and `b`. If `idx` is 0 or if the conditions for executing the loop are not met (e.g., fewer than 3 integers in `list_divisors`), then `a` and `b` will remain unchanged from their initial values and `sys.stdout.write` will output these unchanged values.***
