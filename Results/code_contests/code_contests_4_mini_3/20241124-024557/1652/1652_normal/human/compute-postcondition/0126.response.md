According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop will iterate over the elements starting from index 2 of `list_divisors`. Currently, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, and the variable `idx` is 1, indicating that the loop has processed the first two elements (indices 0 and 1) of `list_divisors`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `d` is the integer at index 3 (`list_divisors[3]`). For the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to refer to the next element, which is at index 4 (`list_divisors[4]`). Thus, `list_divisors` must have at least 5 integers for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, and `d` is the integer at index 4 in `list_divisors`.**
