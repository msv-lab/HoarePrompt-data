Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, and `list_divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if not, but `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are assigned based on their comparison. If `d` is less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a`, if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, `a` remains unchanged. In all cases, the values of `a` and `b` are adjusted according to the conditions checked.***
