Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[2]`, `d` is less than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, `a` remains unchanged. The conditions ensure that `a` will always be less than or equal to `d`, which is less than `b`.***
