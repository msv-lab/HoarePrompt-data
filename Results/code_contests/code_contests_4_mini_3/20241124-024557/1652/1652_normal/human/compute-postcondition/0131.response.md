The values of `a` and `b` are swapped based on the condition `a > b`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only state that their order may change. The values of `n`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential change in `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, and the values of `a` and `b` may have been swapped**.
