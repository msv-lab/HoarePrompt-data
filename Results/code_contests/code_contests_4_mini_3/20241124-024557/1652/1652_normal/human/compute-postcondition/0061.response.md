Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[2]`, with `d` being greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is a multiple of `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not a multiple of `b` but is a multiple of `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is neither a multiple of `b` nor a multiple of `a`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. This ensures that the conditions on `d`, `a`, and `b` are consistently maintained across all scenarios.***
