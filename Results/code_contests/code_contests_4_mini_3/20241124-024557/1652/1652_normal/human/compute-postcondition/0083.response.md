Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[4]`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The values of `b` and `d` remain as the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `list_divisors[4]`, respectively.***
