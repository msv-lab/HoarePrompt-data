According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over the elements starting from the third element (index 2) of `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, meaning the current index for `d` is 2 (the third element), and the loop has not yet processed the fourth element (index 3). 

To determine the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed to the next element. Since `d` is currently the third element, for the loop to execute again, `d` must be updated to the fourth element in `list_divisors` (index 3). 

Thus, the adjusted states need to reflect that the loop will now consider the fourth element of `list_divisors`, which is the next value for `d`. The other states such as `n`, `list_divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx` can remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`.**
