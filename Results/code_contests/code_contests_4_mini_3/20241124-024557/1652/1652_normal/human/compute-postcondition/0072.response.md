`a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is `list_divisors[3]`. The previous value of `a` was the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and it is now updated to the value of `d`. The other variables `n`, `divisors`, `idx`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `a` is `list_divisors[3]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]**
