Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[2]`, with `d` being greater than or equal to `b` and `d` not being a multiple of `b`. If `d` is a multiple of `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. This accounts for the scenario where `d` is not a multiple of `a` while ensuring the conditions on `d` and `b` continue to hold.
