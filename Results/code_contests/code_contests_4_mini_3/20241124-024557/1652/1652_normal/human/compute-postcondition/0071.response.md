The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is `list_divisors[3]`, which is the fourth element in the `list_divisors`. This changes the value of `b` from the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]` to the value of `d`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is now `list_divisors[3]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]`.
