Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[4]`; `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the condition for swapping is not met.**
