Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, `a` remains unchanged.***
