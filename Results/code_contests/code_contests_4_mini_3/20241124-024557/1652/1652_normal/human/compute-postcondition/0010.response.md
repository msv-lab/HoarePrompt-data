The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. The initial state indicates that `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and since `b` is now being set to `d`, the value of `b` will equal `d`. Other variables (`n`, `list_divisors`, `nb_test`, `idx`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and now `b` equals `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and now `b` equals `d`.**
