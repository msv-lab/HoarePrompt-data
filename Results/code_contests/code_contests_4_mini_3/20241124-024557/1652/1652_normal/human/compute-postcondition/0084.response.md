Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[4]`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. In any other case, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. This ensures that `b` can be equal to `d` if it is a multiple of the maximum of the first two divisors, and `a` can be updated to `d` if it is a multiple of the minimum of the first two divisors.
