The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is defined as the integer at index 4 in `list_divisors`, the assignment of `b` will result in `b` being equal to that value. The values of `n`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `idx`, `list_divisors`, and the new value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, `d` is the integer at index 4 in `list_divisors`, and `b` is the value of `d`**.
