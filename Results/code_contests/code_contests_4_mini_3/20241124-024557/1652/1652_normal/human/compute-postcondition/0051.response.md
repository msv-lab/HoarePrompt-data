The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements of the `list_divisors` map object. Since `list_divisors` is a map object of integers converted from the space-separated string in `line`, we can infer that `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]` will yield two integers. The values of `n`, `divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx` are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of values to `a` and `b` based on the contents of `list_divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is the next index to be processed, `a` is list_divisors[0], `b` is list_divisors[1]**
