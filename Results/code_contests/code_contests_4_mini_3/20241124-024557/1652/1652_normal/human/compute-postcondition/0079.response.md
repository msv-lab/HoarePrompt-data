Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After this, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but less than `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. In all cases, if `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
