Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, and `d` is the integer at index 3 in `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is set to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
