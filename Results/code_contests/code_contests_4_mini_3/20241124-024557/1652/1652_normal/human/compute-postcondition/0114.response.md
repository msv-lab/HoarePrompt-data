Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `d` is less than `b`, and if `d` is greater than or equal to the previous value of `a`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` is unchanged.***
