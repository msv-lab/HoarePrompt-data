Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `divisors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `a` is the minimum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `b` is the maximum of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, `d` is `list_divisors[2]`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not a multiple of `b`, and `d` is a multiple of `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0`).***
