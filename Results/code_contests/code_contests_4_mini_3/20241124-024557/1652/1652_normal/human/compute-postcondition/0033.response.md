Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. After evaluating the conditions, `a` and `b` will either be swapped or remain unchanged based on their values prior to the execution. Additionally, if `d` is less than `a`, or if `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. Overall, the values of `a` and `b` are determined by the comparisons and divisibility checks involving `d`.***
