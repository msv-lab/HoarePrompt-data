The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The initial conditions specify that `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`. However, since `a` is being set to `d`, the specific previous value of `a` is not mentioned in the initial state. The states of the other variables (`n`, `list_divisors`, `nb_test`, `idx`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, `d` is divisible by `a`, and `a` is equal to `d`.**
