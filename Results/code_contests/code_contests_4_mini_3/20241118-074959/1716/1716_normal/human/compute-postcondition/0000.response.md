The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Impossible'. The values of the variable `n` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not alter them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and 'Impossible' is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and 'Impossible' is printed**.
