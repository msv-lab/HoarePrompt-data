The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate within the constraints that `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each name is a distinct string that contains only lowercase Latin letters with a length ranging from 1 to 100. However, since no parameters are explicitly passed to the function, the specific return value based on `n` or the names is not defined in the provided output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` cannot be determined based solely on the given information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified in the provided output.**
