The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. According to the output specifications, it processes an integer `n` that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and it also handles unique strings representing names, which are composed only of lowercase Latin letters and have a length ranging from 1 to 100. However, since there are no provided outputs or conditions based on these inputs, we cannot determine specific return values or behavior.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is not explicitly defined based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and requires specific constraints on an integer n and unique strings representing names, but the return value is not specified.**
