The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Impossible'. This does not change the values of any variables, including `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `n` and mentions the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and 'Impossible' is printed**
