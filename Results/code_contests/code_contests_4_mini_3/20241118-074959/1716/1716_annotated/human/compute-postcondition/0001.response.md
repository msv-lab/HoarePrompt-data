The code `exit(0)` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is stopped. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and 'Impossible' is printed, and the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and 'Impossible' is printed, and the program exits.**
