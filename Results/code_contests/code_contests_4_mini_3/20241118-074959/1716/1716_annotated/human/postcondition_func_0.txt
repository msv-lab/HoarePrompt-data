The function `func_1` accepts no parameters, prints the string 'Impossible', and then immediately terminates the program with an exit status of 0. This indicates a successful exit despite signaling an impossibility. Since there are no conditions or return values specified in the code, it does not handle any specific constraints on parameters or provide any outputs beyond the printed message.
