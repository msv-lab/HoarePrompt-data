Correctness: **False**

The provided program only contains a single function that prints "Impossible" and exits. It does not implement any logic to determine whether there exists an order of letters that would allow the names to be sorted lexicographically, nor does it generate any valid order of letters if such an order exists.

For instance, given the names:
```
3
rivest
shamir
adleman
```
The program should output a specific order of letters if possible, but it simply outputs "Impossible" without any context or validation of the names. 

The program fails to address the core requirement of the problem, which is to analyze the names and derive any possible letter ordering or to determine if it is indeed impossible. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description fully, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
