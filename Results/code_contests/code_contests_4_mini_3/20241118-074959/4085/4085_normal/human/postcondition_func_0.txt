The function accepts user input in the form of three space-separated strings, where the first string contains two integers representing the lengths of two sequences, and the next two strings contain integers representing the elements of each sequence. It calculates how many times the cumulative sums of the two sequences become equal while iterating through them. The function prints the count of these occurrences but does not return any value. If either sequence length is zero, the count remains zero, and no iterations are performed.
