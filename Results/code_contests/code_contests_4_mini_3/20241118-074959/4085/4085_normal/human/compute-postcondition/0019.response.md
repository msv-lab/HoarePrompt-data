The value of `s1` is updated by adding `int(q2[p1])` to it. The variable `p1` has been increased by 1, so it now points to the next index in the list `q2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s2`, `f`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Since `s1` was previously less than `s2`, the state of `s1` will still be less than `s2` after the addition, but we do not know the specific values of `q2` or `s1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to `s1` and `p1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `s1` is updated; `s2` is unchanged; `f` and `p2` remain unchanged; `p1` is increased by 1**
