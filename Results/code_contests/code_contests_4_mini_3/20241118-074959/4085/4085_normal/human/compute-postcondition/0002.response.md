The code assigns the result of `raw_input().split()` to `q3`. This means that `q3` will hold a list of strings that are split based on whitespace from the user input. The initial state of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `q1`, and `q2` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `q3`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n positive integers; `y` is a list of m positive integers; `q1` is a list of strings from user input; `q2` is a list of strings from user input; `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by whitespace.**
