The variable `s1` is assigned the value `0`. The initial states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `p1` is less than `a1`; `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `p1` is less than `a1`; `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0**
