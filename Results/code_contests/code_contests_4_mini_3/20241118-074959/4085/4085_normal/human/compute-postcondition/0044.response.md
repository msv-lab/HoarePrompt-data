Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers in the range 1 to 100,000. If `s1` equals `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is greater than its previous value by 1, and `p2` is greater than its previous value by 1. If `s1` does not equal `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.***
