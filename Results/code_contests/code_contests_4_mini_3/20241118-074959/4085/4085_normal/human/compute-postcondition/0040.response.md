The variable `s2` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state indicates that `s1` is already `0`, and the other variables (`n`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`) remain unaffected as they are not mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values for the unaffected variables, along with the updated value of `s2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `p1` is less than `a1`; `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0**
