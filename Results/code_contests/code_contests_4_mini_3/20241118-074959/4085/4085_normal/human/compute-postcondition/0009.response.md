The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `int(q1[1])`. The initial state specifies that `q1` is a list of strings derived from user input. Therefore, `q1[1]` will be a string representing a positive integer. The value of `a2` will be the integer equivalent of that string.

Since we do not have specific values for `q1` or `q1[1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a2`. However, the other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n positive integers; `y` is a list of m positive integers; `q1` is a list of strings from user input; `q2` is a list of strings from user input; `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by whitespace; `s1` is an integer derived from `q2[0]`; `s2` is an integer derived from `q3[0]`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is an integer derived from `q1[0]`; `a2` is an integer derived from `q1[1]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n positive integers; `y` is a list of m positive integers; `q1` is a list of strings from user input; `q2` is a list of strings from user input; `q3` is a list of strings from user input split by whitespace; `s1` is an integer derived from `q2[0]`; `s2` is an integer derived from `q3[0]`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is an integer derived from `q1[0]`; `a2` is an integer derived from `q1[1]`**
