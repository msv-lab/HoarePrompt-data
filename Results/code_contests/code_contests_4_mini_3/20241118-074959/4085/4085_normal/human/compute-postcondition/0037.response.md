Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, `p2` is increased by 1 (ensuring it remains less than `a2`), and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`. If `s1` is equal to or greater than `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `s1` equals `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is increased by 1 (ensuring it remains less than `a1`), and `p2` is also increased by 1 (ensuring it remains less than `a2`.***
