The variable `q2` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns that list to `q2`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `q1` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n positive integers; `y` is a list of m positive integers; `q1` is a list of strings from user input; `q2` is a list of strings from user input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n positive integers; `y` is a list of m positive integers; `q1` is a list of strings from user input; `q2` is a list of strings from user input.**
