The variable `p2` is incremented by 1, which means its value increases from its previous state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the previous conditions while noting the change in `p2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `p1` is greater than its previous value; `p2` is now greater than its previous value by 1; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; and `f` is increased by 1**
