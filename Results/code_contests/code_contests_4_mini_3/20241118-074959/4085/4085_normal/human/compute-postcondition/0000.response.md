The code snippet `q1 = raw_input().split()` takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This means that `q1` will now hold a list of string representations of the input values. The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Since we cannot determine the exact content of the input, we simply note that `q1` will contain the user-provided input as a list of strings.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n positive integers; `y` is a list of m positive integers; `q1` is a list of strings from user input.**
