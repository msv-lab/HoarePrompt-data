The value of `p1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p1` is unknown, so it cannot be determined specifically. The values of `n`, `m`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `s1` is less than `s2`; `f`, `p2` remain unchanged; `p1` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `s1` is less than `s2`; `f`, `p2` remain unchanged; `p1` is increased by 1**
