Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers in the range 1 to 100,000. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`, `p2` is increased by 1, and the values of `s1`, `f`, and `p1` remain unchanged. If `s1` is not greater than `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.***
