The value of `p2` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p2` is not specified, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `p1` is now `p1 + 1`; `p2` is now `p2 + 1` and is still less than `a2`; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; and `f` is increased by 1.
