The variable `s1` is assigned the value `0`, which overrides its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `s1` is now `0`, and we know that `s1` was previously equal to `s2`, then `s2` is also `0`. Therefore, we conclude that `s1` and `s2` are both `0`. The output state reflects the current values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `x` is a list of n positive integers; `y` is a list of m positive integers; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings from user input; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is an integer derived from `q1[0]`; `a2` is an integer derived from `q1[1]`; and `s1` is equal to `s2`.**
