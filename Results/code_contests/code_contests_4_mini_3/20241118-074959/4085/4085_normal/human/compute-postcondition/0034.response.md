Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000. If `s1 < s2`, then `p1` is increased by 1, ensuring it remains less than `a1`, and `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]`. If `s1` is equal to or greater than `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `s1` equals `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is increased by 1 and remains less than `a1`, and `p2` is increased by 1 and remains less than `a2`.***
