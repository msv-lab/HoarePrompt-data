The value of `p1` is increased by 1, while the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, and `p2` remain unchanged, as the condition regarding `s1` and `s2` is not specified in this scenario. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `p1` but keeps the other variables the same. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers in the range 1 to 100,000; `s1` and `s2` are unchanged; `f` is unchanged; `p1` is greater than its previous value by 1; `p2` is unchanged.**
