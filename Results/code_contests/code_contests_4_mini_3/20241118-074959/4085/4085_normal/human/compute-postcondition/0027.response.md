The code initializes `s2` to 0. The other variables `n`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, and `s1` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `s2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `p1` is less than `a1`; `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0**
