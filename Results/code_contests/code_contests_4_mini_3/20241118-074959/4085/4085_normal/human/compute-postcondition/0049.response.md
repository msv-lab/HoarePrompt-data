The value of `s2` is updated by adding the integer value of `q3[p2]` to it. The variable `p2` has been increased by 1, which means it now points to the next index in the `q3` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `s1`, `f`, and `p1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `s2` based on the new index from `p2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers in the range 1 to 100,000; `s1` remains unchanged; `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`; `f` remains unchanged; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` is increased by 1.**
