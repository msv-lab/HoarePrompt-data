Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated by adding the value of `int(q3[p2])`. If `s1` is less than or equal to `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.***
