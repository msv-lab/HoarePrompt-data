The value of `p2` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p2` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `m`, `s1`, `s2`, and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `s1` is greater than `s2`; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `s1` is greater than `s2`; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` is increased by 1.**
