Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers in the range 1 to 100,000. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is increased by 1, and `s1` is updated by adding `int(q2[p1])`, while `s2`, `f`, and `p2` remain unchanged. If `s1` is not less than `s2`, then the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.***
