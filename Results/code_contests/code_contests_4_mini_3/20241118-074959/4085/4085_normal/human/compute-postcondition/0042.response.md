The value of `p1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p1` is less than `a1`, but the exact value is not specified. Therefore, we can state that `p1` is now greater than its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `p1` is greater than its previous value; `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; and `f` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `p1` is greater than its previous value; `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; and `f` is increased by 1**
