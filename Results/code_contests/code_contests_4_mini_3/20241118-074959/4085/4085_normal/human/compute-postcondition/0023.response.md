The code assigns `s2` the value of `s2 + int(q3[p2])`. Since `p2` is increased by 1, it will access the element in `q3` at the new index (which is `p2 + 1` before the assignment). The previous values of `s1` and `s2` are not specified, but we know `s1` is greater than `s2`. The variable `p1` remains unchanged, and `p2` is increased by 1.

The output state reflects that `s2` is updated based on the new value from `q3`, while `s1`, `p1`, and the updated `p2` are also mentioned.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000; `s1` is greater than `s2`; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` is increased by 1; `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`**
