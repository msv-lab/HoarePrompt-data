Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100,000. If `s1` equals `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is increased by 1 and remains less than `a1`, while `p2` is increased by 1 and remains less than `a2`. If `s1` does not equal `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.***
