Output State: **If `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`, the loop will execute as long as either `s1` is less than or greater than `s2`. If `s1` equals `s2`, `s1` and `s2` are reset to 0 and `f` is incremented. The values of `f`, `p1`, and `p2` will depend on how many times the condition `s1 == s2` is true before exiting the loop. If the loop ends, either `p1` will equal `a1` or `p2` will equal `a2`, and `s1` and `s2` will hold their last computed values. If `a1` or `a2` is initially 0, the loop will not execute, leaving `f` at 0, `p1` at 0, and `p2` at 0. If `s1` and `s2` never reach equality, `f` will remain 0.**
