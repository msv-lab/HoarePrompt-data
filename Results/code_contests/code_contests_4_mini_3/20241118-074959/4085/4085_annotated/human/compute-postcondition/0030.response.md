The value of `p2` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p2` is unknown. The values of `f` and `p1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1**
