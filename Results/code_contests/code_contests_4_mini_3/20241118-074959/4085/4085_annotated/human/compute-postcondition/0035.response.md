The value of `p2` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p2` is unknown. The values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, and `p1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; and `p2` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; and `p2` is increased by 1**
