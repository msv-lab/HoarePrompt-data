The variable `s2` is assigned the value `0`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0**
