Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p2` in `q3`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is increased by the integer value of `q2[p1]`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1, thus ensuring all possible conditions regarding the relationship between `s1` and `s2` are addressed.***
