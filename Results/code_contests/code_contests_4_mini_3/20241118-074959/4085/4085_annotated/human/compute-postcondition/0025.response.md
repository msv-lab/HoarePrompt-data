According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `p1`, `a1`, `p2`, and `a2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as both `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. 

Since `n` and `m` are specified as positive integers and do not directly affect the loop's condition, we focus on the variables `p1`, `a1`, `p2`, and `a2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop are as follows:
- `p1` is less than `a1` (which allows the loop to potentially execute)
- `p2` is less than `a2` (which also allows the loop to potentially execute)

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we must ensure both conditions hold true. Thus, we need to adjust the values of `p1` and `p2`.

However, since the current state does not provide specific values for `p1`, `a1`, `p2`, and `a2`, we cannot make exact adjustments without those values. 

Given the condition provided, if `p1` is already less than `a1` and `p2` is already less than `a2`, the state remains unchanged as both conditions are satisfied for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000, and p1 is less than a1 and p2 is less than a2**
