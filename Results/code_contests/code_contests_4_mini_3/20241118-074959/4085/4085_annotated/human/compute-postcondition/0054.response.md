The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It deals with two messages represented by blocks of lengths, which are positive integers. The lengths of the blocks in the first message are denoted as `x1, x2, ..., xn`, and the lengths of the blocks in the second message are denoted as `y1, y2, ..., ym`. The function ensures that both `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 100,000, and that the lengths of each block in both messages are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1,000,000. Moreover, the total length of blocks in both messages must be equal. 

After executing the function body, it performs checks and returns various outputs based on the conditions defined for the lengths of the blocks. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle two messages represented by blocks and ensure that the lengths of these blocks meet specific constraints, returning results based on those constraints.

Functionality: **The function handles two messages with block lengths and checks that the total lengths of the blocks are equal while adhering to specified constraints on the lengths and quantities of the blocks.**
