The value of `p2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p2` is unknown, but it will now be one greater. The values of `n`, `m`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `p2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `s1` is greater than `s2`; `p1` and `s1` have been updated such that `p1` has been incremented by 1 and `s1` is now equal to the original `s1` plus `q2[p1]`; `s2`, `f`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged; `p2` is incremented by 1.**
