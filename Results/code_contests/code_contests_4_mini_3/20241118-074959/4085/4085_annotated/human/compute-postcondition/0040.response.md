The value of `s2` is assigned the value of `0`, which is already its current value. The values of `n`, `m`, `s1`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; and the values of `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; and the values of `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.**
