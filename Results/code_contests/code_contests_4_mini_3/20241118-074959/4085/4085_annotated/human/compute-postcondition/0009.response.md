The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `int(q1[1])`, meaning it takes the second element of the list `q1` and converts it to an integer. The previous state does not affect the other variables, and we do not know the specific values of `q1[1]`, so we cannot determine a specific value for `a2`. Therefore, the output state remains dependent on the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from user input; `s1` is the integer value of `q2[0]`; `s2` is the integer value of `q3[0]`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]; `a2` is the integer value of `q1[1]**
