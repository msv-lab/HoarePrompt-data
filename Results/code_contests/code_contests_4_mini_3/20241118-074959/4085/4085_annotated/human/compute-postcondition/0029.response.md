The value of `p1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p1` is unknown. The value of `f` is increased by 1, but this does not affect `p1`. Therefore, the output state is: `f` is increased by 1, and `p1` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`f` is increased by 1, and `p1` is increased by 1**
