The value of `p2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p2` remains unchanged, while `n`, `m`, `s1`, `s2`, and the values of `f` and `p1` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `p2` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `f` is incremented by 1; `p1` is incremented by 1; `p2` is incremented by 1**
