Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from user input; if `s1` is equal to `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged in their respective states. Furthermore, `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]` and `a2` is the integer value of `q1[1]`.***
