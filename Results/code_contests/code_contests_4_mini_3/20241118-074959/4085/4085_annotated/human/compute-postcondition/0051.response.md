According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p1`, `a1`, `p2`, and `a2`. The loop will execute again as long as both conditions `p1 < a1` and `p2 < a2` are true.

At the end of the last iteration, we are given that `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. However, we need to ensure that these conditions hold for the next iteration.

Since `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000, there are no specific adjustments needed to `n` and `m`. The important variables here are `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2`.

Thus, the state remains unchanged because both conditions for the loop to execute one more time are still satisfied.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000, and `p1 < a1` and `p2 < a2`**
