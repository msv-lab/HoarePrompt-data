The variable `q3` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes user input as a string and splits it into a list of strings. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `q1`, and `q2` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `q3` based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q3` is a list of strings obtained from user input split from the raw input.**
