Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; if `s1` is less than `s2`, `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated to `s1` plus the integer value of `q2[p1]`, while `s2`, `f`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. If `s1` is not less than `s2`, all values remain unchanged.***
