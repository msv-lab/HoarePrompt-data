The value of `p1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p1` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `p1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from user input; `s1` is equal to `s2`, `s2` is now 0; `f` is 1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]`, and `a2` is the integer value of `q1[1]**
