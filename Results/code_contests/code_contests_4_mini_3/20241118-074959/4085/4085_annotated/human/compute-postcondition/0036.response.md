The variable `p2` is increased by 1, which means its previous value was incremented. The code then assigns to `s2` the value of `s2` plus the integer value of `q3` at the index `p2`. The initial state does not provide the current values of `s2` or `q3`, but we know that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range. Since `s2` is affected by the new value at `q3[p2]`, the output state indicates that `s2` has been updated based on the new `p2` and the current state of `q3`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `s2` is updated based on `q3[p2]` after `p2` is incremented by 1.**
