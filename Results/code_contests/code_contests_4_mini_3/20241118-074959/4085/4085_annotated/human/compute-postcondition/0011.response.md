The variable `s1` is assigned the value `0`, which overrides its previous value. Since `s1` was initially equal to `s2`, and now it is set to `0`, `s2` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from user input; `s1` is 0; `s2` is the integer value of `q3[0]`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]; `a2` is the integer value of `q1[1]; and `s1` is equal to `s2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from user input; `s1` is 0; `s2` is the integer value of `q3[0]`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]; `a2` is the integer value of `q1[1]; and `s1` is equal to `s2`.**
