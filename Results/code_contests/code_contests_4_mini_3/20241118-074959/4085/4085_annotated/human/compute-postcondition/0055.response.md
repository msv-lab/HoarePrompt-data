Functionality: ** The function reads two lists of integers from user input, representing two sequences of block lengths. It counts how many times the cumulative sums of the blocks from both sequences become equal during the comparison process. The function increments the counter `f` whenever the cumulative sums are equal and continues until it has processed all elements in one of the sequences. If the sequences are empty or the initial values lead to the loop not executing, it will return a count of 0. **
