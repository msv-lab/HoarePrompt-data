`p1` is assigned the value of `p1 + 1`, which increments `p1` by 1 while the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, and `p2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment in `p1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `f` is incremented by 1; `p1` is incremented by 1; `p2` remains unchanged.**
