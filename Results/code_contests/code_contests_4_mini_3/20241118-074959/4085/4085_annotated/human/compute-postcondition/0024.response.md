Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1, `s2` is updated by adding `int(q3[p2])`, and all other variables including `s1`, `f`, `p1`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. If `s1` is not greater than `s2`, all values remain unchanged.***
