The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `int(q1[0])`, which means it will hold the integer representation of the first element of the `q1` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The specific value of `a1` will depend on the input provided for `q1[0]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from user input; `s1` is the integer value of `q2[0]`; `s2` is the integer value of `q3[0]`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is the integer value of `q1[0]**.
