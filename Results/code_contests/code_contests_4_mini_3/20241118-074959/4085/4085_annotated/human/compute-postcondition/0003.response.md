The variable `s1` is assigned the value of `int(q2[0])`, where `q2[0]` is the first element of the list `q2`. Since `q2` is obtained from user input and contains strings, `s1` will be the integer value of that first string. The states of `n`, `m`, and the other lists are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q3` is a list of strings obtained from user input split from the raw input; `s1` is the integer value of `q2[0]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q3` is a list of strings obtained from user input split from the raw input; `s1` is the integer value of `q2[0]`**.
