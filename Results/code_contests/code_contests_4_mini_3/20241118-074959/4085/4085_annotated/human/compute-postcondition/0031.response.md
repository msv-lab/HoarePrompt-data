Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are increased by 1. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, their values remain unchanged, and the values of `f`, `p1`, and `p2` also remain unchanged.***
