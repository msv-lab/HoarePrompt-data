The variable `s2` is assigned the value of `int(q3[0])`, which means it converts the first element of the list `q3` from a string to an integer. The value of `q3` is obtained from user input, but the specific value is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `s2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q3` is a list of strings obtained from user input split from the raw input; `s1` is the integer value of `q2[0]`; `s2` is the integer value of `q3[0]`**
