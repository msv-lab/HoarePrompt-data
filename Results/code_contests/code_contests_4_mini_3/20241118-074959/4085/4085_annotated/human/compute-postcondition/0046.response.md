The value of `p1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p1` is unknown. The value of `q2[p1]` is accessed, which depends on the specific value of `p1`. Since `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]` to it, and `s1`'s previous value is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `s1`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `p1` is incremented by 1, and `s1` is increased by the integer value of `q2[p1]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `p1` is incremented by 1, and `s1` is increased by the integer value of `q2[p1]**
