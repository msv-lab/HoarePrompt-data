To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, I will analyze the code against various edge cases.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input correctly and splits it into the necessary parts: the lengths of the sequences, the costs of spells, and the sequences themselves.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - It checks if all elements of sequence `b` can be found in sequence `a` and if they are in the correct order. If not, it outputs `-1`, which correctly handles the impossibility condition.
   - If the sets of warriors in `a` and `b` are equal, it outputs `0`, indicating no mana is needed.

3. **Gaps Calculation**: The program calculates gaps between elements in `a` that are not in `b`. The logic seems to correctly identify these gaps.

4. **Special Gap Handling**: The code specifically checks for the condition where the maximum element in `a` that is not in `b` is present and if the gap to that element is less than `k`. If this condition is met, it outputs `-1`, which is correct.

5. **Mana Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total mana cost using either fireball or berserk spells based on the costs provided. It correctly compares the costs and chooses the optimal spell usage.

### Potential Issues
However, there are potential edge cases that are not handled correctly:

- **Missing Gaps Calculation Logic**: The program does not account for the scenario where multiple gaps exist after a "special" warrior is encountered. If `k` is larger than any of the gaps in the sequence, it will still attempt to use berserk spells on them without checking if the gap is valid for fireball usage.
  
- **Edge Case with Consecutive Warriors**: If `b` contains consecutive warriors that are not present in `a`, the program will output `-1` only after checking the gaps. It does not check directly for this scenario beforehand, which could cause it to incorrectly compute mana when it should have output `-1`.

### Example Case
Consider the following test case which exposes the potential flaw:
```plaintext
Input
5 3
10 2 5
5 2 1
3 1 2

Output should be -1
```
In this situation, the program might incorrectly attempt to compute gaps with the assumption that certain operations can be performed, despite the specified warriors in `b` not being constructible from `a`.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and identified potential issues with the logic, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The code does not account for all scenarios appropriately, particularly regarding the direct relationship between sequences `a` and `b` and the potential gaps that can arise.
