The function accepts no parameters but internally calls `func_2()` four times to retrieve values for variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, and `b`. It checks for matches between lists `a` and `b` and counts how many elements from `b` are found in `a` up to index `m`. If there are fewer matches than `m`, it prints -1 and exits. If the unique elements of `a` and `b` are the same, it prints 0 and exits. It then calculates the gaps (consecutive non-matching elements in `a`) and evaluates a special condition based on the maximum value in `a`. The function ultimately calculates a result based on the conditions of `x`, `y`, and the gaps, printing the final result. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include situations where `a` is empty or when `m` is zero, which would affect the matching logic and the subsequent calculations.
