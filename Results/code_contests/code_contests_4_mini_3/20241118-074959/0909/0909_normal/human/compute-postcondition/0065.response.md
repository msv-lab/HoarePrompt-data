Output State: **`j` is either incremented by 1 if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, in which case `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to True. If `ax` does not equal `b[j]`, then `gl` is incremented by 1. If `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True. The values of `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged, `a` contains at least one element, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, and `ax` is the last element in `a`.**
