Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the third element of `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m`, or if `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` remains unchanged.***
