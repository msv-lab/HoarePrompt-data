The variable `special` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `special` was `False`, so after execution, `special` changes to `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 0, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is True, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `ax` is equal to `mx`.
