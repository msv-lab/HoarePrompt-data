Postcondition: ***If `ax` equals `mx`, then `special` is set to True. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to True. If `ax` does not equal `b[j]`, then `gl` is incremented by 1. The values of `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged, `a` contains at least one element, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, and `ax` is the last element in `a`. Additionally, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, it will also trigger the condition to set `special` to True regardless of other checks.***
