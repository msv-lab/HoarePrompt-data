Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `ax` is equal to `mx`. Additionally, either `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`.***
