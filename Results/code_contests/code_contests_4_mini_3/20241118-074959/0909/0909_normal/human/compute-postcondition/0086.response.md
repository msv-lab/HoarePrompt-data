According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `gaps` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `gaps` has at least 2 elements. To allow the loop to be executed one more time, `gaps` must have at least 3 elements, and `g` should be the third element in the list. Since `g` is currently the second element, it will change to the third element, and the index needs to be incremented accordingly.

State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list of counts with at least 3 elements, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`, `ans` is updated, `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`, `g` is the third element in `gaps`, and `ans` is updated by adding `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`.
