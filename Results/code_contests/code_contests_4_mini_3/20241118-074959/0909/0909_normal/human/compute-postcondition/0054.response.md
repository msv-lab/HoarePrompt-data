Output State: **`j` is either incremented by 1 if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, in which case `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False; or if `ax` does not equal `b[j]`, then `gl` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True; `gaps` is a list that captures the count of gaps encountered, with `gl` reflecting the current count of consecutive elements not matching the criteria; `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged; `a` continues to contain at least one element; `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `ax` is undefined; and `special` is set to True.**
