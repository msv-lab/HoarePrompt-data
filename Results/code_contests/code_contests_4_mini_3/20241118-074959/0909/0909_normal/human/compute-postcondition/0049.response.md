The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. The variables `j`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `a`, `i`, and `ax` remain unchanged as per the initial state. The previous values of `j` and the other variables do not affect the assignment to `specialgap`. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is incremented by 1; `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged; `a` continues to contain at least one element; `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `ax` is undefined; `specialgap` is equal to `gl`.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1; `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged; `a` continues to contain at least one element; `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `ax` is undefined; `specialgap` is equal to `gl`**.
