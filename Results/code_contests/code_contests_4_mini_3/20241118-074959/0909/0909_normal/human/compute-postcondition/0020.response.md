Postcondition: ***`j` is the count of matches found in `a` that correspond to the elements in `b` up to index `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function continues execution without printing or returning anything. If `a` is empty, `j` remains 0 and the loop does not execute. If `m` is 0, `j` also remains 0 regardless of the contents of `a`.***
