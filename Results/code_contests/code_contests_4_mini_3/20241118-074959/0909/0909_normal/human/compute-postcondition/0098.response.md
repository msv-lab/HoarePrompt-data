Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of `y` multiplied by each element in `gaps`, `j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list of counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`. If `gaps` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0.**
