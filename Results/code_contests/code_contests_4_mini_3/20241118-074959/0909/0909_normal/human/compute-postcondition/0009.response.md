According to the code, the loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in the iterable `a`. Since `a` has at least 1 element at the end of the last iteration and `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute again with the next element of `a`. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1, which indicates the next element in `a` will be accessed during the next iteration. The variable `ax`, which is the current element of `a`, should now be the second element of `a`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the loop's iteration.

State: **`n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, and `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element of `a`**
