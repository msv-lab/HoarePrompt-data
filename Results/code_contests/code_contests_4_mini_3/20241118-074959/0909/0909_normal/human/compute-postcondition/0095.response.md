According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the `gaps` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `gaps` list. At the end of the last iteration, `gaps` has at least 2 counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `gaps` list must have at least 3 elements.

Additionally, since the loop variable `g` will take the next value from the `gaps` list, we need to increment the index of `g` to reflect that the next iteration of the loop will use the next element in `gaps`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that the `gaps` list has at least 3 counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`.

State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list with at least 3 counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`, `ans` is updated to `ans + y * g`**
