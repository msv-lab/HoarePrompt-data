According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `gaps` list. If the list contains at least one more element, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `gaps` has at least 3 counts of consecutive non-matching elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `gaps` must have at least 4 elements, and `g` will take the value of the next element in the list.

State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list with at least 4 counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`, `ans` is updated to `ans + y * g`**
