To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we must analyze the state before the loop starts and the structure of the loop itself.

1. The loop is structured as `for (i, ax) in enumerate(a):`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the iterable `a`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be an iterable that contains at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The loop variable `i` will be initialized to `0` on the first iteration, and `ax` will be assigned the first element of `a`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the state reflects that `a` is an iterable with at least one element. 

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are assigned values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`**
