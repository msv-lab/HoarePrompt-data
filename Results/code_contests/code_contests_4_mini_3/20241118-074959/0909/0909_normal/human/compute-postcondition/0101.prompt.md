You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000; x, k, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n; b is a list of m distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *`j` is the count of matches found in `a` that correspond to the elements in `b` up to index `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function continues execution without printing or returning anything. If `a` is empty, `j` remains 0 and the loop does not execute. If `m` is 0, `j` also remains 0 regardless of the contents of `a`.

Case_2: *`j` is the count of matches found in `a` that correspond to the elements in `b` up to index `m`; `sa` is the set of elements from `a` and `sb` is the set of elements from `b`. If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the program prints `0` and returns without any further action. If the sets are not equal, no action is taken, and the program continues executing without returning a value.

Case_3: *`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list of the counts of consecutive elements in `a` that did not match the corresponding elements in `b`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, and `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns without making any modifications to the variables. Otherwise, no action is taken in the else part, leaving the state of `j`, `gaps`, `gl`, and `special` unchanged.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
