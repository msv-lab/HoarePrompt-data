The variable `gl` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`j`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `i`, `ax`, and `gaps`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `gl` while stating the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ax` is undefined, `gaps` now contains `gl`, and `gl` is 0**
