The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is currently 0. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables along with the newly assigned `specialgap`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is True, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, `j` is less than `m`, `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, and `specialgap` is 0**
