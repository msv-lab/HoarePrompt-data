The variable `gl` is assigned the value 0. The values of `j`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, and `gaps` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is now 0, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, and `gl` is 0.

Output State: **`j` is now 0, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, and `gl` is 0**.
