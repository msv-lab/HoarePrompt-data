To deduce the output state, we analyze the impact of the code snippet on the program's state.

The line `ans += y * g` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the product of `y` and `g` to its current value. The other variables `j`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, and `x` are not directly affected by this operation.

We do not have specific values for `y` and `g`, but we know `g` is the second element in `gaps`. The previous state of `ans` is updated by the result of `y * g`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ans` as well as the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list with at least 2 counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + y * g`**
