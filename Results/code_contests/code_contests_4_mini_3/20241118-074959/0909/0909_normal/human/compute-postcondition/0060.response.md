The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, and since no information is provided about `gl`, we cannot determine its value. The variable `j` has been incremented by 1, but the value of `j` is not specified. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `j` has been incremented and that `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1; `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`.**
