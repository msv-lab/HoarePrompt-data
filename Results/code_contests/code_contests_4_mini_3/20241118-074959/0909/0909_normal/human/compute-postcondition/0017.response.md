Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an iterable with at least 0 elements, `j` is an integer count of matches found in `a` that correspond to the elements in `b` up to index `m`, and `j` is less than `m`. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop may have executed, incrementing `j` only for matches between elements in `a` and `b` while `j` remained less than `m`. If `m` is 0, `j` remains 0.***
