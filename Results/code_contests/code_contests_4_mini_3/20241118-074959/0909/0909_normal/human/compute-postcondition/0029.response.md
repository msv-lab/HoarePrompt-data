The variable `j` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not change the values of `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, or `gaps`, which remain as previously defined. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is now 0, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, and `gaps` is an empty list.

Output State: **`j` is now 0, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, and `gaps` is an empty list.**
