The value of `gl` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `gl` is 0, so after execution, `gl` becomes 1. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 1, `special` is True if `ax` is equal to `mx`, and `i` is 0.
