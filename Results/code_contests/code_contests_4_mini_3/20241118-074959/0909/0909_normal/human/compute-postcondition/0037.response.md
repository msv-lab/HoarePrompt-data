Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, and `a` is a list with at least 1 element. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is 0. If `special` is False, `specialgap` remains undefined. Additionally, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `j` is less than `m`, with `ax` equal to `b[j]`.***
