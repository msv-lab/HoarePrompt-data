Postcondition: ***If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If `ax` does not equal `b[j]`, then `gl` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True. The values of `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged, while the value of `ax` is the last element in `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, and `j` retains its previous value if the first condition is not met. Thus, `gaps` is updated accordingly based on the conditions, while all other variables remain unchanged.***
