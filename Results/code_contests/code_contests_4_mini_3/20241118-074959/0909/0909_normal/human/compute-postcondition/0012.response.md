According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `a`. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `a` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means we have processed the first element of `a`. Since `a` has at least 2 elements, we can conclude that the next value of `i` will be 2, and `ax` will be the third element of `a`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 2 and `ax` should be set to the third element of `a`. The states `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` do not need to be adjusted because they are not directly involved in the loop execution in this context.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `b` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the third element of `a`.**
