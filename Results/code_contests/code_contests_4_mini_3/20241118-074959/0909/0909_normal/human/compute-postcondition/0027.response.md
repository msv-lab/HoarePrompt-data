The expression `mx = max(sa - sb)` attempts to compute the maximum value from the difference between the sets `sa` and `sb`. 

Since the output only mentions that if the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the program prints `0` and returns without any further action, we need to check if the sets are equal before executing the code. 

If `sa` and `sb` are not equal, we can proceed with the calculation. The value of `mx` will depend on the elements in the difference of the two sets. However, without specific elements in `sa` and `sb`, we cannot determine the exact value of `mx`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that the sets are not equal and that `mx` is assigned a value based on the maximum of the difference set.

Output State: **`j` is the count of matches found in `a` that correspond to the elements in `b` up to index `m`; `sa` and `sb` are not equal; `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`.**
