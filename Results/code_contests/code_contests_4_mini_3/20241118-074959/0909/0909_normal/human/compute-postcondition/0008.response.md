Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are values returned by `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, and `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an iterable with at least 1 element, and `b` is a value returned by `func_2()`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` (the first element of `a`) is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, while `i` remains 0. If either condition is not met, `j` remains unchanged, and the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `ax` stay the same.***
