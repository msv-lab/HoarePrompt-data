The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `m`: an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000.
- `x`: an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `k`: an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `y`: an integer where 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9.
- `a`: a list of `n` distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n.
- `b`: a list of `m` distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n.

The function has multiple cases regarding its output:

Case 1: If `j`, the count of matches found in `a` corresponding to the elements in `b` up to index `m`, is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns `None`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function continues execution without printing or returning anything.

Case 2: If `j` is the count of matches found in `a` corresponding to the elements in `b`, and if the sets of elements from `a` and `b` are equal, the program prints `0` and returns without any further action. If the sets are not equal, no action is taken, and the program continues executing without returning a value.

Case 3: If `j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, and if `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns without making any modifications to the variables. Otherwise, no action is taken in the else part, leaving the state of `j`, `gaps`, `gl`, and `special` unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the lists `a` and `b` to evaluate matches and handle specific conditions based on the counts of these matches, potentially printing values or returning based on the results of these evaluations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and lists `a` and `b`. It evaluates matches between `a` and `b`, may print -1 or 0 based on certain conditions, and may return without any value depending on the match counts and set equality.**
