According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `gaps` list. For the loop to execute again, `gaps` must contain at least one more element beyond what has already been processed in the previous iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `g` is the first element in `gaps`. For the loop to execute one more time, `gaps` must have at least two elements, and `g` should be the second element in the `gaps` list. Additionally, since `g` is the first element in `gaps`, we set the next value of `g` accordingly.

State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list with at least 2 counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`, `ans` is updated to `ans + y * g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, `g` is the second element in gaps**
