Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1, while the values of `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged. The array `a` continues to contain at least one element, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and `ax` is undefined. If `special` is true, then `specialgap` is set to `gl`. There is no change to any variables if `special` is false.***
