Postcondition: ***`j` is the count of matches found in `a` that correspond to the elements in `b` up to index `m`; `sa` is the set of elements from `a` and `sb` is the set of elements from `b`. If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the program prints `0` and returns without any further action. If the sets are not equal, no action is taken, and the program continues executing without returning a value.***
