The code appends the value of `gl` (which is 0) to the list `gaps`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 1, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` now contains 0, `gl` is 0, and `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `j` is less than `m`, with `ax` equal to `b[j]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` now contains 0, `gl` is 0, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `j` is less than `m`, with `ax` equal to `b[j]**
