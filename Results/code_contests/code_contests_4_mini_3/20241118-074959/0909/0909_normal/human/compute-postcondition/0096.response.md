The statement `ans += y * g` updates the value of `ans` by adding the product of `y` and `g` to it. The variables `j`, `gaps`, `gl`, and `special` remain unaffected by this operation. The output state will reflect the updated value of `ans`, while the other variables will retain their previous values.

Output State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list with at least 3 counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + y * g`**.
