The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing `j` from 0 to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 1, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, `j` is less than `m`, and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, `j` is less than `m`, and `ax` is equal to `b[j]**
