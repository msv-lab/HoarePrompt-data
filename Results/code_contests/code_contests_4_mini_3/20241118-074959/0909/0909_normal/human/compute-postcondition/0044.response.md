Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `sa` and `sb` are not equal, `mx` is assigned the maximum value from the difference of the sets `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is True if `ax` (the first element of list `a`) is equal to `mx`. If `ax` is not equal to `mx`, `special` remains False. The variable `a` contains at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and either `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`.***
