The code appends `gl` to the list `gaps`. The values of `j`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged, and since `ax` is undefined, it does not affect the output state. The array `a` still contains at least one element, and the previous state of `gaps` is also not specified, but the action of appending `gl` modifies the state of `gaps`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ax` is undefined, and `gaps` now contains `gl` added to it.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ax` is undefined, and `gaps` now contains `gl`**
