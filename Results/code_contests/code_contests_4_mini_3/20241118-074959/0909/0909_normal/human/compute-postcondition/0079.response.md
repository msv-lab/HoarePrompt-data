Postcondition: ***`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list of the counts of consecutive elements in `a` that did not match the corresponding elements in `b`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, and `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns without making any modifications to the variables. Otherwise, no action is taken in the else part, leaving the state of `j`, `gaps`, `gl`, and `special` unchanged.***
