Output State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list of counts of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `x` is less than `y * k`, `ans` is updated to include the total contribution from all elements in `gaps`, calculated as the sum of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` for each element `g` in `gaps`. If `gaps` is empty, `ans` remains 0. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, `ans` is equal to the sum of `y` multiplied by each element in `gaps`, and if `gaps` is empty, `ans` remains 0.**
