The variable `ans` is incremented by `y * g`. Given that `g` is the first element in `gaps`, the value of `g` is known. Therefore, we calculate the new value of `ans` as `ans + y * g`. The other variables (`j`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `x`, `y`, and `mx`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list with at least 1 count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`, `ans` is updated to `ans + y * g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, `g` is the first element in gaps**
