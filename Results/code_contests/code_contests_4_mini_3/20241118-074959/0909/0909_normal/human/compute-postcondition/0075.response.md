The `debug_print(gaps)` function is called to display the current state of the `gaps` list. The state of the variables `j`, `gl`, and `special` remains unchanged as this function does not modify them. The output will simply reflect the current contents of the `gaps` list.

Output State: **`j` is the count of elements in `b` that have been matched with elements in `a`, `gaps` is a list of the counts of consecutive elements in `a` that did not match the corresponding elements in `b`, `gl` is the current count of consecutive non-matching elements in `a`, and `special` indicates if the last element of `a` matched the maximum value `mx`; `gaps` includes the new value of `gl`.**
