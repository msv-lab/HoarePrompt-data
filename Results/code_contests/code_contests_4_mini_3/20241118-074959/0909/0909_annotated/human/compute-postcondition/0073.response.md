Postcondition: ***If `a` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is less than `m`, and `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which may have been incremented depending on the elements of `a`, and `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it was reset to 0. If `a` is empty, `gaps` remains as an empty list, `j` stays at 0, `gl` remains at 0, and `special` is False, resulting in no assignment to `specialgap`.***
