The value of `gl` is assigned to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are: `gaps` now contains the value of `gl` (which is 0), `special` remains False, `i` was incremented by 1, and `j` was increased by 1, while `specialgap` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`gaps` is 0, `special` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` remains unchanged**
