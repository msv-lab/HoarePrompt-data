The variable `gl` is assigned the value 0. The other variables mentioned in the initial state (`gaps`, `i`, `ax`, `special`, `j`, and `specialgap`) are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new value of `gl`.

Output State: **`gaps` contains the previous values plus `gl`, `i` is `n + 1`, `ax` is the element at index `n + 1` in `a`, `special` is unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `specialgap` remains unchanged, and `gl` is 0.**
