Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a potentially non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, and `j` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements matched from `b`. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns None, indicating that not all elements of `b` were found in `a`. If `a` is empty, `j` remains 0, and no elements from `b` can be matched, resulting in the same condition. If any matched elements are found, the value of `j` represents how many elements from `b` were found in `a` sequentially, but if `j` is still less than `m`, -1 is printed regardless.***
