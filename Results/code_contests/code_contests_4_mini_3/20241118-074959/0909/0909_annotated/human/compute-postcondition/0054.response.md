The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `special`. The previous value of `special` was `False`, so now it changes to `True`. The values of the other variables (`gaps`, `i`, and `ax`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0, `special` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `ax` is the next element in `a`.

Output State: **`gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0, `special` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `ax` is the next element in `a`**
