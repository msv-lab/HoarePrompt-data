The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unchanged, so it will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, `ax`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `ax` is the second element of `a`, `i` is 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.
