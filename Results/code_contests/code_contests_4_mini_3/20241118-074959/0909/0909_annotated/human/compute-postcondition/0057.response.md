Postcondition: ***`gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0 if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, in which case `j` is incremented by 1 and `special` remains unchanged while `gaps` is updated with the value of `gl`. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` does not equal `b[j]`, then `special` is set to True if `ax` equals `mx`, otherwise `special` remains False, while `gl` is incremented by 1. In either case, `i` is incremented by 1.***
