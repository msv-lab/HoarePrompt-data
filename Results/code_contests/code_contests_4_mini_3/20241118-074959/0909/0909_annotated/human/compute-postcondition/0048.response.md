The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0, `special` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0, `special` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.**
