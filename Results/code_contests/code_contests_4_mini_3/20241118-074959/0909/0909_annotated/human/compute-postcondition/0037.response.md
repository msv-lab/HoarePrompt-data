Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is 1, `sa` is the set of elements from `a`, `sb` is the set of elements from `b`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is a boolean indicating whether a special condition is met, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`, and `ax` is equal to `b[j-1]`. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is set to 0. If `special` is False, `specialgap` remains unchanged (implicitly undefined in this context).***
