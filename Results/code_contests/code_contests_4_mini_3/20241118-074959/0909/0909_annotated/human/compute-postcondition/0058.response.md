To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates through the elements of the list `a` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `ax`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0 if certain conditions are met.
   - `j` is either less than `m`, and `ax` equals `b[j]`, in which case `j` is incremented by 1, or it is not, causing `special` to be set based on the value of `ax` relative to `mx`.
   - Regardless of the conditions, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Next Iteration Conditions**: The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of list `a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the state reflects the updated values of `i`, `ax`, and any relevant conditions for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting States**: 
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 after the last iteration, we need to set `i` to `i + 1`.
   - The value of `ax` should be the next element in list `a`, which would be `a[i + 1]`, provided `i + 1` is still less than the length of `a`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: To continue with the loop, we must ensure that `i` is adjusted properly, and `ax` is set to the next element in `a`. Thus, if `i` was `n` before, we will adjust it to `n + 1`, and `ax` to `a[n + 1]`.

Taking all of this into account, we can summarize the necessary adjustments as follows:

State: **`gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `i` is n + 1, `ax` is the element at index n + 1 in a, `special` is unchanged, `j` is either incremented by 1 if j < m and ax equals b[j] or remains unchanged if not.**
