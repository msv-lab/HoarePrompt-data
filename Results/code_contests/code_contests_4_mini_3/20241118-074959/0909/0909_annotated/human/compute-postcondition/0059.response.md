The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is either unchanged or incremented based on the condition provided, but since the specific condition is not evaluated here, we assume that `j` is incremented. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `i` is n + 1, `ax` is the element at index n + 1 in a, `special` is unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `i` is n + 1, `ax` is the element at index n + 1 in a, `special` is unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1**
