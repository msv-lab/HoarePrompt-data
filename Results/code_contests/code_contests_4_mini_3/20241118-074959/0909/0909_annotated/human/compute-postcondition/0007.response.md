The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since the initial condition states that `j` is less than `m`, it will now be `j + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `ax` is the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `j` is less than `m`.
