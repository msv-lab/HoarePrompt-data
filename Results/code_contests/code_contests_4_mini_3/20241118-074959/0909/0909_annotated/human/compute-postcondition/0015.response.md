According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more elements in the iterable `a`. The loop will continue as long as `i` (the index) is less than the length of `a`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, meaning it has at least 3 elements, which allows for the loop to execute one more time. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3, and `ax` will take the value of the fourth element in `a`.

Thus, to allow for one more execution of the loop, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `ax`. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `ax` is the fourth element of `a`, `i` is 3**
