According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `a`. The loop will execute as long as there are more elements in `a` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, meaning it has processed the first element of `a`, and since `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, it must have at least a third element for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `ax` should be the third element of `a`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `ax` is the third element of `a`, `i` is 2**
