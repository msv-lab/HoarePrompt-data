The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0. The states of the other variables, `gaps`, `special`, `i`, and `j`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0; `special` is False; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is increased by 1; `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`.

Output State: **`gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0; `special` is False; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is increased by 1; `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`**
