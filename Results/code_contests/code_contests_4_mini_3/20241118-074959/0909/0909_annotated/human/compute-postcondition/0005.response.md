According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is a non-empty iterable. Since `j` is initialized to 0 and will not affect the loop execution, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element for the loop to start. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `a` must be a non-empty iterable, and the index `i` will start at 0, with `ax` being the first element of `a`.

State: **`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `m` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `x` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `y` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `ax` is the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
