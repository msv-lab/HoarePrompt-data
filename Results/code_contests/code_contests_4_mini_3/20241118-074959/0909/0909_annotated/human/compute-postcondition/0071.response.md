Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty iterable. `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it was reset to 0, `j` is less than `m`, `special` is True, and `gl` may have been incremented depending on the elements of `a`. If `a` is empty, then `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False.***
