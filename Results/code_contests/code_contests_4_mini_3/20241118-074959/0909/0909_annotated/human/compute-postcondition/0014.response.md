Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `ax` is the third element of `a`, `i` is 2, and if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` does not equal `b[j]`, then `j` remains unchanged.***
