Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is 0, `sa` is the set of elements from `a`, `sb` is the set of elements from `b`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is set to True if the first element `ax` of `a` is equal to `mx`. If `ax` is not equal to `mx`, `special` remains unchanged. Edge cases include scenarios where `ax` could be equal to `mx` or not, and it is guaranteed that either `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`.***
