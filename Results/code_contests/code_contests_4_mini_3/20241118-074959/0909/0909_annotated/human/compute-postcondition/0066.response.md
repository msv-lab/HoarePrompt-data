Postcondition: ***`gaps` contains the value of `gl`, `i` is n + 1, `ax` is the element at index n + 1 in `a`, `special` is set to True if `ax` equals `mx`. The variable `j` is either incremented by 1 if `j < m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, or remains unchanged if not. If `ax` does not equal `mx`, the value of `special` remains unchanged.***
