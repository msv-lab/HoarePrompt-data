The variable `gl` is initialized to 0. There are no other variables affected by this line of code, and the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `j`, `sa`, `sb`, and `gaps` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `gl` and retains the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a potentially non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is 0, `sa` is the set of elements from `a`, `sb` is the set of elements from `b`, `gaps` is initialized as an empty list, `gl` is 0**
