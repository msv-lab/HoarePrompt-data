Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a potentially non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements matched from `b`, `sa` is the set of elements from `a`, and `sb` is the set of elements from `b`. If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None. If the sets are not equal, the function does not perform any actions.***
