The code snippet provided is a `print(-1)` statement, which outputs the value `-1` to the console. The execution does not affect the values of any of the variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, `b`, or `j`). Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables as well as the printed output.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a potentially non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is a non-negative integer, and the output is -1**
