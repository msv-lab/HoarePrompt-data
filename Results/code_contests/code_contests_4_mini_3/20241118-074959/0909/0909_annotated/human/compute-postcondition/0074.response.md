The code `gaps.append(gl)` adds the current value of `gl` to the list `gaps`. In the initial state, if `a` is non-empty, `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl` before it was reset to 0. If `a` is empty, `gaps` remains an empty list. The values of `j`, `gl`, and `special` are not changed by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is determined by whether `a` is empty or not. If `a` is non-empty, `gaps` will include the previous value of `gl`, while if `a` is empty, `gaps` will still be an empty list.

Output State: **If `a` is non-empty, `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl`; if `a` is empty, `gaps` is an empty list.**
