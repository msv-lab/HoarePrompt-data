You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000; x, k, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1,000,000,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; b is a list of m distinct integers where each integer b_i is such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a potentially non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, and `j` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements matched from `b`. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns None, indicating that not all elements of `b` were found in `a`. If `a` is empty, `j` remains 0, and no elements from `b` can be matched, resulting in the same condition. If any matched elements are found, the value of `j` represents how many elements from `b` were found in `a` sequentially, but if `j` is still less than `m`, -1 is printed regardless.

Case_2: *`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a potentially non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements matched from `b`, `sa` is the set of elements from `a`, and `sb` is the set of elements from `b`. If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None. If the sets are not equal, the function does not perform any actions.

Case_3: *If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, there are no operations performed, and the function will also return None. Thus, regardless of the condition, the function terminates without modifying any variables.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
