Postcondition: ***`gaps` contains the previous values plus `gl` if `j < m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, while `j` is incremented by 1, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If `special` is true, `specialgap` remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, `gaps` retains the previous value of `gl`, and if `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True. In this case, `j` might still be incremented by 1 if `j < m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, or it remains unchanged if not, while `gl` is incremented by 1.***
