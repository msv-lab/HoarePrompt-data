The `debug_print(gaps)` statement will output the current value of `gaps`. The state of `gaps` depends on the initial condition of `a`. If `a` is non-empty, `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl`, while if `a` is empty, `gaps` is an empty list. Since there is no alteration to the values of other variables, the output state reflects the current value of `gaps`.

Output State: **If `a` is non-empty, `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl`; if `a` is empty, `gaps` is an empty list.**
