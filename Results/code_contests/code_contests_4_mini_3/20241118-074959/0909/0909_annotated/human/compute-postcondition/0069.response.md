According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a` and the current index `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `j` could have been incremented, and `special` was set to False. 

To determine the new state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The variable `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
2. We need to ensure that `i` remains less than the length of `a` to allow the loop to execute again.
3. The variable `ax` should be updated to reflect the next element in the list `a`.

Since the loop is using `enumerate(a)`, which provides both the index and the value of the elements in `a`, we will increment `i` and assign `ax` to the next element in the list.

Therefore, if `i` was `n-1` (the last valid index for `a`), the loop cannot execute again. However, if `i` is less than `n-1`, we can increment it and retrieve the next value for `ax`.

We do not have the exact values for `i`, `a`, or the length of `a`, so we will state the conditions needed for the next iteration to proceed.

Assuming the current state is such that `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, we would adjust `i` and `ax` accordingly. 

State: **`gaps` contains the previous values plus `gl` if `j < m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, while `i` is incremented by 1, `ax` is the next element in the list `a`, `j` remains unchanged, `gl` retains its previous value, and `special` is False**.
