Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `ax` is the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, and `j` is a non-negative integer. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, remaining less than `m`. If the condition is not met, `j` remains unchanged.***
