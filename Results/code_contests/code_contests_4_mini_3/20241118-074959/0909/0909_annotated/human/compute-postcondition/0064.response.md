The variable `special` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`gaps`, `i`, `ax`, `j`, `specialgap`, and `gl`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` contains the previous values plus `gl`, `i` is `n + 1`, `ax` is the element at index `n + 1` in `a`, `j` is incremented by 1, `specialgap` remains unchanged, and `gl` is 0; `special` is now `False`.
