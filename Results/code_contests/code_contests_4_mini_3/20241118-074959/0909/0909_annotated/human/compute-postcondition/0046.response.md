Postcondition: ***If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True. If the first condition is not met, then `gaps` remains empty, `gl` is incremented by 1, and `special` is set to True if `ax` equals `mx`. In all cases, the variables maintain their relationship as described, with `gaps` reflecting the current state of gaps identified based on the conditions of `ax` and `b`.***
