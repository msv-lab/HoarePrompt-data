The `gaps` list has the method `append()` called on it, which adds the value of `gl` to the end of the list. The previous value of `gaps` is not specified, but it will now include the value of `gl`. The variable `special` is False, so `specialgap` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `j` were incremented previously but do not affect the state after the `append()` operation.

Output State: **`gaps` now contains the value of `gl`, `special` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `specialgap` remains unchanged.**
