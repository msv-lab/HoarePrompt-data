Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a potentially non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is a non-negative integer that represents the number of elements matched from `b`. The loop executes for each element in `a`. If `a` is empty, the loop does not execute and `j` remains 0. After the loop, if `j` is less than `m`, then `j` will represent how many elements from `b` were found in `a` sequentially. If no elements of `b` are found in `a`, `j` will remain unchanged at its initial value of 0.**
