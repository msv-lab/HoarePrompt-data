The value of `gl` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`gaps`, `i`, `ax`, `special`, and `j`) remain unchanged because the code only affects `gl`. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before the increment, `i` is `n + 1`, `ax` is the element at index `n + 1` in `a`, `special` is set to True if `ax` equals `mx`, and `j` is either incremented by 1 if `j < m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, or remains unchanged if not.
