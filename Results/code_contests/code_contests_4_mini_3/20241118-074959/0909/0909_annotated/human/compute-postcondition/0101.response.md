The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly. It relies on values returned by another function `func_2()`, which provides the integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, and `y`. Additionally, it uses two iterables: `a`, which is a potentially non-empty iterable of distinct integers, and `b`, which is an iterable of length `m`. The function also utilizes a non-negative integer `j`, representing the number of elements from `b` matched in `a`. 

The functionality of the function can be described in three cases:

**Case 1:** If `j` (the number of matched elements from `b` in `a`) is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns None, indicating that not all elements of `b` were found in `a`. If `a` is empty, `j` remains 0, leading to the same condition.

**Case 2:** If the sets derived from `a` (denoted as `sa`) and `b` (denoted as `sb`) are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None. If these sets are not equal, no actions are performed.

**Case 3:** If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, no operations are performed, and the function still returns None.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the results of `func_2()` and the provided iterables `a` and `b`, performing different actions based on the relationships and conditions regarding the matches found and the equality of the sets derived from those iterables. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes the values returned by `func_2()` and iterables `a` and `b`. It returns None while printing -1 or 0 based on specific conditions related to the matches of elements and the equality of sets.**
