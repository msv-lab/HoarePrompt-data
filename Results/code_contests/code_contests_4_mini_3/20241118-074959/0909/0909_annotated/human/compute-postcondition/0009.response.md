According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the iterable `a`. The variable `i` is the index of the current element, and `ax` is the current element in the iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has processed the first element of `a`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to reflect the next index, which would be 1, and `ax` must be updated to the second element of `a`. The iterable `a` must also have at least 2 elements to allow for this next iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `ax` is the second element of `a`, `i` is 1, and `j` remains unchanged**
