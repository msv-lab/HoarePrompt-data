Functionality: ** The function processes values returned by `func_2()` and checks if all elements of iterable `b` are present in iterable `a`. If not all elements are found, it prints -1. If the sets of unique elements in `a` and `b` are equal, it prints 0. If the conditions regarding gaps between matched elements in `a` and `b` are satisfied, it calculates a total based on defined rules using variables `x`, `y`, and `k`, and prints the result. The function does not return any value explicitly; it only prints results based on the conditions evaluated. If `a` is empty or does not contain elements of `b`, or if `specialgap` is less than `k`, it prints -1. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, it computes the total differently based on the elements in `gaps`.**
