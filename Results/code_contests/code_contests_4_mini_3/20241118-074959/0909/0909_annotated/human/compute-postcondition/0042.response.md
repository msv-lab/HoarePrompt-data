Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is 0, `sa` is the set of elements from `a`, `sb` is the set of elements from `b`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is set to False, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`, and `ax` is equal to `mx` (where `mx` is defined as the relevant value in the context).***
