According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `a`. If `a` is potentially non-empty, it should have at least one element for the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` will be the first element in `a`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, `j` is 0, `sa` is the set of elements from `a`, `sb` is the set of elements from `b`, `gaps` is initialized as an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is set to False, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`**
