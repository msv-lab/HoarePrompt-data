The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `gaps`, and `specialgap` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables while also indicating that `-1` was printed.

Output State: **`a` is non-empty, `gaps` contains the previous value of `gl`, `specialgap` is less than `k`, and -1 is printed**.
