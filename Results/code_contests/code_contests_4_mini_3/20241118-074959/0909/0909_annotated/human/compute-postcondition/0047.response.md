To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided conditions and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The loop is structured as `for (i, ax) in enumerate(a):`, which means it will iterate over the elements of the list `a`. The variable `i` represents the current index of the iteration, and `ax` represents the current element in the list `a`.

2. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a` to enumerate.

3. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration doesn't explicitly mention the value of `i`, we can infer that `i` must be less than the length of `a` for the loop to execute again.

4. If `i` is currently the index of the last element in `a` (which would be `len(a) - 1`), the loop cannot execute again, as there would be no more elements to iterate over. 

5. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented to reflect the next iteration index, which would be `i + 1`.

6. The new `ax` value would be the next element in the list `a`, which would be `a[i + 1]`, assuming `i + 1` is still within the bounds of the list.

Considering the above points, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the next index.
- `ax` should be set to the next element of the list `a`, specifically `a[i + 1]`.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect these changes.

State: **`gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0, `special` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, `ax` is the next element in `a`**.
