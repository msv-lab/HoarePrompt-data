The value of `gl` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `gl` is not specified. The states of the other variables, `gaps`, `special`, `i`, and `ax`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0, `special` is True if `ax` equals `mx`, otherwise `special` remains False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `gl` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`gaps` contains the value of `gl` before it is reset to 0, `special` is True if `ax` equals `mx`, otherwise `special` remains False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `gl` is increased by 1**
