Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a potentially non-empty iterable, `b` is an iterable of length `m`, and `j` is a non-negative integer. The value of `j` is less than `m`, indicating that not all elements from `b` were found in `a` during the loop execution. If no elements of `b` were found in `a`, then `j` remains 0.***
