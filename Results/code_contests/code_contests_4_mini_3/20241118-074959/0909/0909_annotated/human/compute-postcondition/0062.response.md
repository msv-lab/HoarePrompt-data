The operation appends the value of `gl` to the list `gaps`. The variable `gaps` is modified by adding a new element, but other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `gaps` now contains `gl` added to its previous values.

Output State: **`gaps` contains the previous values plus `gl`, `i` is `n + 1`, `ax` is the element at index `n + 1` in `a`, `special` is unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and if `special` is true, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. If `special` is false, `specialgap` remains unchanged.**
