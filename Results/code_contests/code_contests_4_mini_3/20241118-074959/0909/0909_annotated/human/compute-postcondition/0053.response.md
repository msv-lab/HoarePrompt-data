The value of `special` is assigned `False`, which was already its value. Therefore, there is no change to the variable `special`. The states of the other variables (`gaps`, `i`, `j`, `specialgap`) remain unchanged. The output state is: `gaps` is 0, `special` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`gaps` is 0, `special` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` remains unchanged**
