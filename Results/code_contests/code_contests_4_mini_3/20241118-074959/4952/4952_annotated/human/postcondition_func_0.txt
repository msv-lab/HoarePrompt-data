The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` followed by a string `s` from user input. It constructs a new string `ns` by concatenating characters from `s` in a specific pattern: first it attempts to concatenate every second character from the end of the string to the beginning, and then it concatenates every second character from the beginning of the string, depending on whether `n` is odd or even. However, it does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than the length of `s`, which could lead to index errors. The function prints the resulting string `ns`, but if `n` is invalid, it may result in an error or unexpected behavior.
