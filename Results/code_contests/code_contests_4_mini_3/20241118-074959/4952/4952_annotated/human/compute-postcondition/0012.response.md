According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0, which means it can execute one more time without any adjustments needed for `i`. 

Since `ns` remains increased by `s[i]`, it does not affect the ability of the loop to execute again, as we only need to ensure that `i` is still valid for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is at least 0, and `ns` remains increased by `s[i]`**
