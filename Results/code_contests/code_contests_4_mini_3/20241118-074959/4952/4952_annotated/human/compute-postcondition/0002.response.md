The variable `ns` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (which is a user-provided input string) and `s` (which is a list of characters from that input string). The assignment of `ns` does not affect `n` or `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a user-provided input string; `s` is a list of characters from that input string; `ns` is an empty string.

Output State: **`n` is a user-provided input string; `s` is a list of characters from that input string; `ns` is an empty string**.
