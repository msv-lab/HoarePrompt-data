The value of `i` is assigned the value `1`. The previous state of `i` could have been a non-negative integer or a negative integer, but it is now specifically `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is an even integer, `ns` remains unchanged, `s` is either not a string or an empty string.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an even integer, `ns` remains unchanged, `s` is either not a string or an empty string**
