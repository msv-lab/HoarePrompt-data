According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. The error message indicates that there was an attempt to concatenate a string to an integer, which suggests that the program state is currently in an invalid state due to this type mismatch issue. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is a valid integer and that it is greater than or equal to 0. Since the error message does not provide the value of `i`, we can infer that `i` must be adjusted to a non-negative integer value to avoid the concatenation error.

We will adjust the state to reflect a valid integer for `i` that meets the loop condition. 

State: **Error: cannot concatenate a string to an integer and i is a non-negative integer**
