The value of `ns` is incremented by the value of `s[i]`. Since `i` is 2 or greater, the specific value of `s[i]` is not known, but it is being added to `ns`. The previous value of `ns` will increase by the value of `s[i]`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2 or greater, `ns` is increased by `s[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2 or greater, `ns` is increased by `s[i]**
