The code attempts to execute the operation `ns += s[i]`. However, there is an error since it cannot concatenate a string (ns) to an integer (s[i]), indicating that `s[i]` is an integer. The state of the variables does not change due to this error. Therefore, the output state remains as is, indicating the error in the operation.

Output State: **Error: cannot concatenate a string to an integer; `i` is a non-negative integer**
