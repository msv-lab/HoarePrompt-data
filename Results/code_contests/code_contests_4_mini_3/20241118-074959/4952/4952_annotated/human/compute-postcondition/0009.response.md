According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `i` is a non-negative integer and has been decreased by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 2 before it is decreased, which means `i` must be adjusted to be 2 or greater.

The error mentioned is about concatenating a string to an integer, which suggests that there may be an operation in the loop that attempts this. However, since we are only concerned with adjusting the state to allow for one more iteration, we focus on ensuring that `i` is still non-negative.

Thus, the adjustments needed are minimal: `i` needs to be set to a value that is still non-negative after being decreased by 2. 

State: **`i` is 2 or greater**
