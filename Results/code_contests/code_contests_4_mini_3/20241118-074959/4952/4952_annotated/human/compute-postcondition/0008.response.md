The value of `i` is decremented by 2. Since `i` is a non-negative integer, it can take values such that `i - 2` remains non-negative. However, the initial state indicates there is an error because the operation is attempted on a string and an integer. Nonetheless, the code modifies `i` by subtracting 2 from it. The output state reflects the change in `i`, while acknowledging the error condition. 

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is decreased by 2, but there is an error: cannot concatenate a string to an integer**.
