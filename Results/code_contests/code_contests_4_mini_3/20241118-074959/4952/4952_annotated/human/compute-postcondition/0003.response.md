The value of `n` is a user-provided input string, which means that it is not a number. When trying to perform the operation `n - 2`, it will result in an error because you cannot subtract an integer from a string. Therefore, the output state reflects that the operation cannot be completed.

Output State: **Error: cannot subtract an integer from a string**
