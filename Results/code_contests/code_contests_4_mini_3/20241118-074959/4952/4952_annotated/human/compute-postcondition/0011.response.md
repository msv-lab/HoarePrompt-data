The value of `i` is decremented by 2, and since `i` is 2 or greater, after execution, `i` will be at least 0. The state of `ns` is not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is at least 0, and `ns` remains increased by `s[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is at least 0, and `ns` remains increased by `s[i]`**
