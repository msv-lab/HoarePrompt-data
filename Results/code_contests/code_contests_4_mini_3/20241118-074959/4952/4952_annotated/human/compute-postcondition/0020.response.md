The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, the possible new values for `i` are 2 or 3. The state of `n` and `ns` remains unchanged, and there is no effect on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer; `i` is either 2 or 3; `ns` remains unchanged; and access to `s[i]` may still cause an index error depending on the context.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `i` is either 2 or 3; `ns` remains unchanged; access to `s[i]` may cause an index error.**
