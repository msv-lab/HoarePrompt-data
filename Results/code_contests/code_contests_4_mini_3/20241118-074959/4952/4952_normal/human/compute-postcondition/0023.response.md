The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since the previous value of `i` can be either 2 or 3, the new value of `i` will be either 4 or 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ns` is updated to include one character from `s`, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `n` is greater than 3.

Output State: **`ns` is updated to include one character from `s`, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `n` is greater than 3**
