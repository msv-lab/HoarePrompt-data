The value of `ns` is updated by appending the character `s[i]` to it. The initial state indicates that `s` is a list of characters derived from the string `n`, and `i` is a non-negative integer, which means `s[i]` will be a valid character from the list. The previous value of `ns` is an empty string, so after execution, `ns` will contain the character at index `i` from list `s`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string input by the user; `s` is a list of characters from the string input; `ns` is the character `s[i]`; `i` is a non-negative integer**
