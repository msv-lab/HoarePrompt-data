Postcondition: ***`ns` remains an empty string. If `n` is an odd integer, then `i` is set to 0; if `n` is an even integer, then `i` is set to 1. The precondition guarantees that `i` is an integer, and `s` is a list of characters derived from `n`. Additionally, if `i` is less than 0 before any loop execution, `ns` will still remain an empty string.***
