The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` can either be 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` can become either 2 or 3. The variable `ns` remains unchanged as the code provided does not alter it. Therefore, the Output State is: `ns` remains an empty string, and `i` is either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`ns` remains an empty string, and `i` is either 2 or 3**
