The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` is either 4 or 5, this results in `i` being either 6 or 7. The states of the other variables, `ns` and `n`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ns` is updated to include one character from `s`, `i` is either 6 or 7, and `n` is greater than 5.

Output State: **`ns` is updated to include one character from `s`, `i` is either 6 or 7, and `n` is greater than 5**
