According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, but we do not know the value of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`. 

If `i` is 2, then `n` needs to be greater than 2. If `i` is 3, then `n` needs to be greater than 3. Therefore, to ensure that there is at least one possible value of `n` that allows the loop to execute again, we can adjust the state to indicate that `n` is greater than 3. 

Thus, we need to state that `n` must be greater than 3 to accommodate both possible values of `i`.

State: **`ns` remains an empty string, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `n` is greater than 3**
