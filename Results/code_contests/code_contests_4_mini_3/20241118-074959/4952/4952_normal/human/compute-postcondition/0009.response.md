According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been decremented by 2. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 0 after the decrement. Therefore, `i` must currently be at least 2 before the next iteration to satisfy the condition `i >= 0` after decrementing by 2.

Since `i` has been decremented by 2, we need to adjust it to `i` is greater than or equal to 2. There are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a string input by the user; `s` is a list of characters from the string input; `ns` is the character `s[i]`; `i` is greater than or equal to 2**
