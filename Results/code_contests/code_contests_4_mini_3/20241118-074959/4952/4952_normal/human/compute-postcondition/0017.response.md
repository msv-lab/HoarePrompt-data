The value of `i` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is now set to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `ns` is an empty string, `n` is an integer, and `s` is a list of characters derived from `n`, where `n` is even.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `ns` is an empty string, `n` is an integer, and `s` is a list of characters derived from `n`, where `n` is even**
