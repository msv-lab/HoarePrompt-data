The variable `ns` is assigned an empty string `''`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input by the user; `s` is a list of characters from the string input; `ns` is an empty string.

Output State: **`n` is a string input by the user; `s` is a list of characters from the string input; `ns` is an empty string**
