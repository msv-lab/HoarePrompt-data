Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (which is expected to be a positive integer indicating the length of a string) and a string `s` of length `n`. It constructs a new string `ns` by first appending characters from `s` at even indices (in reverse order) followed by characters at odd indices (in the original order). The function ultimately prints the constructed string `ns`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, `ns` remains an empty string and the output will be empty. Additionally, there may be a TypeError if `n` is not an integer or if `s` is not derived correctly.**
