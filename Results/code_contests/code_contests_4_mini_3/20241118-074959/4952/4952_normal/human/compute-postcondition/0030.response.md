The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot conclude what it returns. Therefore, without additional details, we cannot determine the complete functionality of the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters. The return value is unspecified based on the given information.**
