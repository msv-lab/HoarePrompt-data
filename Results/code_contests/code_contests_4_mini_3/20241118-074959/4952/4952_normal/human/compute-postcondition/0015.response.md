The value of `i` is assigned 0. The previous state indicates that `i` was negative after the loop ends, and if `i` was less than 0 before the loop starts, then `ns` remains an empty string. Therefore, the assignment of `i = 0` does not affect `ns`, which stays as an empty string. The output state reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`ns` remains an empty string, `i` is 0**
