The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `r`, and returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r) calculated using the formula factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1))). If `r` is greater than `n`, this will result in an incorrect computation, as the binomial coefficient is not defined in that case. The behavior for negative values of `n` or `r` is not explicitly handled, which may lead to unexpected results or errors.
