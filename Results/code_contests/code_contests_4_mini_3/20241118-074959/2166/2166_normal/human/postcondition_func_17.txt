The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters and redirects standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt', and standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It does not return any value or produce any output directly to the console. This means that any data read from 'input.txt' will not be visible in the console, and any output will be written to 'output.txt'. The function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from file operations, such as file not found or permission errors.
