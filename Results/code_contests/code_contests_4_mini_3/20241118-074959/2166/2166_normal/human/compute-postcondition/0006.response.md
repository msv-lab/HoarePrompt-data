Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is a boolean variable, and `args` is a list with at least 1 element. If `at_start` is False, the value of `sep` has been written to the output file; if `at_start` is True, no output is generated.***
