The code snippet assigns default values to the `sep` and `file` variables by popping these keys from the `kwargs` dictionary, which is not described in the initial state. No values of `n` or `a` are changed, and the output state reflects the unchanged state of these variables along with the new values of `sep` and `file`. 

Since `sep` and `file` are assigned default values (' ' and `sys.stdout`, respectively), we can state that:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`**
