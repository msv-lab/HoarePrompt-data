Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element in the list `args`. If `at_start` is False, the program writes `sep` to `file`. If `at_start` is True, no action is taken regarding `file`.***
