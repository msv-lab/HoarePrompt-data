The code provided is a comment that describes the function of a print statement, but it does not perform any operations or affect the values of the variables. The initial state remains unchanged as there are no assignments or calculations made.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**.
