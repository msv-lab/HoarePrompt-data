`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, but it was already `False` in the initial state, so there is no change in its value. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in the list `args`.
