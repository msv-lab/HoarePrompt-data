Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `args`. If `at_start` is False, a separator `sep` will be written to `file`. If `at_start` is True, no action will be taken regarding writing to `file`.***
