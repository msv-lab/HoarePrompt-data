Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the number of elements appended from the end of `a`, `b` contains the appropriate elements as described, `f` is 0, `k` is 0. If `b[i]` is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. This captures the scenario where `b[i]` is a local minimum in the context of its neighboring values.***
