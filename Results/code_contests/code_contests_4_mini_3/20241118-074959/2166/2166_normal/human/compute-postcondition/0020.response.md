The loop writes elements from the `args` list to the `file`, separated by the `sep` string. The variable `at_start` ensures that the separator is not written before the first element. 

If `args` is empty, the loop will not execute, leaving `at_start` as `True`.

Output State: **`if args` is a list with at least 1 element, `at_start` is False after the loop, and the elements of `args` are written to `file` separated by `sep`. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True.**
