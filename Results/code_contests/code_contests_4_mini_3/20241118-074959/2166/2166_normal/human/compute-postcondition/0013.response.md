The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, which means it remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `sep`, `file`, `args`, and `x`) are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the assignment of `at_start`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `args`.**
