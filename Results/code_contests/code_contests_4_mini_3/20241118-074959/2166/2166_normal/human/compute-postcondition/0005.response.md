The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the output file, which is `sys.stdout`. The variable `sep` is a string, and it has no impact on the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and `sep` has been written to the output.
