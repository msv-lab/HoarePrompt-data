Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is 0; `i` is the number of elements appended from the start of `a` (0 to ⌊n/2⌋); `j` is the number of elements appended from the end of `a` (0 to ⌊n/2⌋); `b` contains the first ⌊(k+1)/2⌋ elements from `a` starting from the last element (if `k` is even) and the first elements of `a` (if `k` is odd) in an alternating pattern; `f` will toggle between 0 and 1; `k` will be equal to the number of iterations executed (0 to n-1). If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `b` remains empty, `i` and `j` retain their initial values (0 and n-1, respectively), and `f` remains 0. The loop handles all cases of toggling and appending elements correctly.**
