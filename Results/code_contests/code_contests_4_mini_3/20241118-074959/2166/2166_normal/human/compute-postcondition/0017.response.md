The code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The initial state indicates that `at_start` is False, so the program will first write `sep` to `file`. Since `x` is the third element in `args`, it has a specific value that is written next. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered, so the output state includes the unchanged values of `n`, `a`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args`, along with the action taken regarding `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `args`, and `sep` is written to `file`, followed by writing `x` to `file`.**
