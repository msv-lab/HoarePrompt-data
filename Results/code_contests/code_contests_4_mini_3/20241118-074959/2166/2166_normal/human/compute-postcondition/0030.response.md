The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` can either be 0 or 1, so after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `b` contains the last element of `a` if `f` was initially 0 or the first element of `a` if `f` was initially 1 appended to it; `f` is toggled between 0 and 1; `k` is 2; and `b` is updated to include `a[i]` based on the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `b` contains the last element of `a` if `f` was initially 0 or the first element of `a` if `f` was initially 1 appended to it; `f` is toggled between 0 and 1; `k` is 2; and `b` is updated to include `a[i]` based on the current value of `i`.**
