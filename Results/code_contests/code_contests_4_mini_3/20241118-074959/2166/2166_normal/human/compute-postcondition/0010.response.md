The code writes the value of `sep` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout`. The initial state of `sep` is ' '. The value of `n`, `a`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x` do not change. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `args`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `args`.**
