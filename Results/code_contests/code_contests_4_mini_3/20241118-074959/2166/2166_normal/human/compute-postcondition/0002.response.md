The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True**
