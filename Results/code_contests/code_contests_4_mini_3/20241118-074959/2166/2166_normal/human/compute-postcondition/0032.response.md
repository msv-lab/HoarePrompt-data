Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1` after adjustments; `b` contains the last element of `a` if `f` was initially 0 or the first element of `a` if `f` was initially 1, and the element at the updated index `i` or `j` of `a` is appended to `b`; `k` is 2; and `f` is toggled between 0 and 1 accordingly. The program handles all cases, ensuring that `i` and `j` remain within valid bounds based on the state of `f`.***
