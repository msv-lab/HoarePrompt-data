The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous state to `False`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` has been written to the output file.
