Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `b[i]` is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`. If `b[i]` is a local minimum (i.e., `b[i] < b[i - 1]` and `b[i] < b[i + 1]`), then `ans` is incremented by 1, while `i` remains 1, `j` is the number of elements appended from the end of `a`, `b` contains the appropriate elements as described, `f` is 0, and `k` is 0. If `b[i]` is not a local minimum, `ans` remains unchanged at 0.***
