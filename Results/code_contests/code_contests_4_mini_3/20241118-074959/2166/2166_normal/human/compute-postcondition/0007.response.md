The code writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. However, the exact value of `x` isn't given in the initial state, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state will reflect that `x` has been written to the output file, but its value is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is a boolean variable, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` has been written to the output file.**
