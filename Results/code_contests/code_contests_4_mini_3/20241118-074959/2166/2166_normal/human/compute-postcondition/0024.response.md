Postcondition: ***`args` is a list with at least 1 element, `at_start` is False after the loop, the elements of `args` are written to `file` separated by `sep`, the last line written to the file ends with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, and if `flush` is set to True in `kwargs`, the flush operation has been executed on the file. If `flush` is not set to True, the flush operation is not executed.***
