The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` can either be 0 or 1, but since it's either of those, after the increment, `ans` can either be 1 or 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 2; `j` is the number of elements appended from the end of `a`; `b` contains the appropriate elements as described; `f` is 0; `k` is 0.
