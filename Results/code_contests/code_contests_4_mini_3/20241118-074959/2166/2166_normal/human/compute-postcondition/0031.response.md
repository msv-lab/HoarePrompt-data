The value of `f` is toggled using the XOR operation with 1. This means if `f` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `f` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `b` contains the last element of `a` if `f` was initially 0 or the first element of `a` if `f` was initially 1 appended to it; `k` is 2; `b` is updated to include `a[i]` based on the current value of `i`; `f` is toggled to either 0 or 1.**
