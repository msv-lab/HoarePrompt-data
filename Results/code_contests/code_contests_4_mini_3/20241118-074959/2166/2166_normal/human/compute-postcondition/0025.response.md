The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a predefined input structure that includes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. Based on the output, the function processes these inputs to produce a result. 

Since no specific output conditions are provided in the prompt, we cannot detail specific return cases. However, we can infer that the function likely generates some output based on the values of `n` and the list `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_20 is to operate on a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct positive integers to produce a result based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, then processes these inputs to produce a result.**
