The code `file.write(sep)` writes the string contained in the variable `sep` to the output stream represented by `file`. In this case, `sep` is a space character (' '). The state of other variables (`n`, `a`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element in the list `args`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element in the list `args`.**
