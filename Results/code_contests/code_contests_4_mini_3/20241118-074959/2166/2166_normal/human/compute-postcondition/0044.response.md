Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `b[i]` (where `i` is 2) is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is not a local minimum, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. In all cases, `b` contains the appropriate elements as described, and the values of `j`, `f`, and `k` remain as previously defined.***
