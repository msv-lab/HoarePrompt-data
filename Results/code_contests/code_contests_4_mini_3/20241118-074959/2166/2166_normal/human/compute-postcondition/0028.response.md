The value of `f` is toggled using the XOR operation `f ^= 1`. If `f` was initially 0, it becomes 1; if `f` was initially 1, it becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`; `b` now contains the last element of `a` if `f` was initially 0 or the first element of `a` if `f` was initially 1 appended to it; `k` is 2; `f` is now either 0 or 1 depending on its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`; `b` now contains the last element of `a` if `f` was initially 0 or the first element of `a` if `f` was initially 1 appended to it; `k` is 2; `f` is either 0 or 1.**
