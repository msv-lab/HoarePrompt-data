According to the code, the loop iterates over the `args` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least one more element than it did at the end of the last iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `args` has at least 1 element.

Since `x` has already been written to the output file, it implies that the current element of `args` has been processed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `args` has at least 2 elements, and `x` should be set to the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `args`**
