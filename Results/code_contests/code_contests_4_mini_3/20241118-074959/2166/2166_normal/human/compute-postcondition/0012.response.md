The code writes the string representation of the variable `x` to the `file`. The value of `x` is taken from the `args` list, which has at least 2 elements. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Since `at_start` is False, the previous condition regarding the separator does not matter for this output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `args`, and `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.**
