Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers; `ans` is 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `b` contains the last element of `a` if `f` was initially 0 or the first element of `a` if `f` was initially 1 appended to it; `i` is increased by 1 if `f` was initially 1, otherwise, `j` is decreased by 1; `f` is toggled between 0 and 1; `k` is 2; and `b` is updated to include `a[i]` based on the current value of `i`.**
