The function accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, `True` if `n` is 2 or 3, and `False` if `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3. For numbers greater than 3 that are not divisible by 2 or 3, it further checks divisibility by numbers of the form `6k Â± 1` (where `k` is a positive integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is prime in this range, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100,000 explicitly.
