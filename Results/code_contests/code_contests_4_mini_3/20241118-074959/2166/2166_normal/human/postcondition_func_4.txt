The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3`. The behavior of `func_5` is entirely dependent on the output of `func_3`, which is not defined in the provided code. Therefore, without knowing the implementation of `func_3`, we cannot determine the specific output or any edge cases that may arise from it.
