The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`. It returns the result of integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1, effectively rounding up the result to account for any remainder from the division. This ensures that the function correctly handles all cases where `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`.
