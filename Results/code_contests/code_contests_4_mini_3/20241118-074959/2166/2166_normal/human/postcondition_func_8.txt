The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, along with a parameter `num`. It generates and returns a 2D list with `n` rows, where each row contains the integer `num` repeated `m` times. The parameter `num` is not restricted to being a list of integers as mentioned in the annotations; it can be any value that can be repeated in the list.
