The function accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It computes the result of \( x^y \mod p \) using the method of exponentiation by squaring. If `y` is 0 or less than 1, it returns 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. If `y` is positive, it returns the calculated value of \( x^y \mod p \).
