The function accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns True. If `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3, it returns False. Otherwise, it checks divisibility against numbers of the form 6k Â± 1 (starting from 5) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these, it returns False; if it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns True. If `n` is 4, the function skips the loop and also returns False. The function does not handle the scenario where `n` is a negative number or zero explicitly, but these cases would return False due to the initial condition check.
