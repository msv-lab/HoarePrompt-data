To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses several functions to read input values and convert them into the required formats. This is done correctly with functions `func_1`, `func_3`, and `func_5`.

2. **Reordering Logic**: The core logic of the program is located in `func_19`. It attempts to reorder the input prices such that cheap ice spheres can be maximized:
   - It initializes two pointers, `i` (starting from the beginning) and `j` (starting from the end), and alternates between adding elements from the end and the beginning of the list to a new list `b`.
   - This alternating approach aims to create a pattern that could potentially maximize the "cheap" ice spheres by ensuring that lower prices are surrounded by higher prices.

3. **Counting Cheap Spheres**: After constructing the new order in `b`, it checks for local minima (cheap ice spheres) in the list by iterating from index 1 to `n-2` and counting how many times the current element is less than its neighbors.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of cheap ice spheres found and the reordered list.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not guarantee that the arrangement will always yield the maximum number of cheap spheres. For example, in certain cases, the prices may be such that arranging them in a strictly alternating fashion from the highest to the lowest does not yield the maximum cheap spheres. 

**Counterexample**:
For an input of prices like `1, 3, 2, 4`, the alternating arrangement might lead to `4, 1, 3, 2`, which results in 0 cheap spheres. A better arrangement could be `2, 1, 3, 4`, which has 1 cheap sphere (`1` is cheap). 

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, while the code attempts to solve the problem, it does not cover all potential cases to guarantee the maximum number of cheap ice spheres can be bought. Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
