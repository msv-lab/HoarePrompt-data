The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the internal constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each price `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function's output is not specified in detail, but it processes the list of prices in accordance with these constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_19` is to operate on a predefined set of parameters without accepting any input directly.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on internal constraints related to a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a.**
