The code snippet writes the string representation of `x` to the output file. Since `at_start` is False, a space character is written to the output before writing `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `x` being written after a space character. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in the list `args`, and a space character followed by the string representation of `x` is written to the output.**
