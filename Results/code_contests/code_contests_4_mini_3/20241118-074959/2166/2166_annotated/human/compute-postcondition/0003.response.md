According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of different positive integers, it is important to clarify the state of `args`, which is not defined in the provided state.

Since the loop will iterate over `args`, the state must ensure that `args` is not empty. Assuming `args` is a list or similar iterable, it needs to have at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states to reflect that `args` contains at least one element. The other variables are not affected by this loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, `args` is a list with at least 1 element**
