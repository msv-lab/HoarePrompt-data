The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in the list `args`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in the list `args`.**
