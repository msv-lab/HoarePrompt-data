Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `b` contains elements of `a` in alternating order, `i` is 2, `j` is adjusted based on `n`, and `f` is toggled between 0 and 1. If `b[i]` is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `b[i]` is equal to or greater than either `b[i - 1]` or `b[i + 1]`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
