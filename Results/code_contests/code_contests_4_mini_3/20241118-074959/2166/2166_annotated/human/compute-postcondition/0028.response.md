The value of `f` is toggled using the XOR operation (`f ^= 1`). If `f` was previously 0, it becomes 1; if it was 1, it becomes 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `f` while retaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `f` is toggled to either 0 or 1, `i` is updated based on the value of `f`, `b` has `a[j]` appended when `f` was 0, and `j` is decreased by 1**
