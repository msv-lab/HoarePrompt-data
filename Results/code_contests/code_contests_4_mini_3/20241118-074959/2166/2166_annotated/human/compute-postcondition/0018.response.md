The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, but its previous state was already `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`; `sep` is ' '; `file` contains the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in the list `args`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`; `sep` is ' '; `file` contains the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in the list `args`.**
