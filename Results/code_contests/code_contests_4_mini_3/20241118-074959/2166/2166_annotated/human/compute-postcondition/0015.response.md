The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the output file. The variable `sep` contains a space character. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged states of other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in the list `args`, and a space has been written to the file.**
