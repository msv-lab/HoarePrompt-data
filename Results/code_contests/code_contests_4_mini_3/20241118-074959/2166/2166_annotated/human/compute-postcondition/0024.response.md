Postcondition: ***If `args` is empty, `file` remains unchanged and `at_start` is True. If `args` has elements, `file` remains unchanged and `at_start` is unchanged, while the `flush` keyword argument has been popped from `kwargs` with a default value of '\n'. If `flush` is True, the `file` is flushed; if `flush` is False, the `file` remains unchanged.***
