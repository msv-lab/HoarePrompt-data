The function `func_20` does not take any parameters but relies on `kwargs` to customize its behavior. It prints the string representations of the elements in `args` to a specified file or to `sys.stdout` by default. The items are separated by a string defined by the `sep` keyword argument, and an optional ending string can be specified through the `end` keyword argument. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output stream after writing.

The function handles the case where `args` may be empty; in this case, it will not write any output to the file, and the original state of `file` will remain unchanged. If `args` contains elements, it will print them in the specified format. The functionality does not explicitly manage or check for any specific types or values for the arguments, which could lead to runtime errors if `args` is not defined in the scope where `func_20` is called.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no explicit parameters but prints the string representations of elements in `args` to a specified output stream, separated by a specified separator, with an optional end string and flush behavior. If `args` is empty, it does not modify the output stream. **
