Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `b` contains elements of `a` in alternating order, `i` is 1, `j` is adjusted based on `n`, and `f` is toggled between 0 and 1. If `b[i]` is less than both its preceding element `b[i - 1]` and its following element `b[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
