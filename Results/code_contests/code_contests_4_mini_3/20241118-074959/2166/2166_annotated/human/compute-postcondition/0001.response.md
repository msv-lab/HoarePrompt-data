The code snippet extracts `sep` and `file` from `kwargs`, with default values of `' '` for `sep` and `sys.stdout` for `file`. Since the initial state provides no specific values for `kwargs`, we cannot determine if `sep` or `file` has been changed, but we can state their defaults.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`; `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout**
