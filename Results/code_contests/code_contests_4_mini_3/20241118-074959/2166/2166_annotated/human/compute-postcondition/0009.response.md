According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `args` list. If the list has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `args` has at least 1 element, and `x` is the current element in `args`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `args` has at least 2 elements, and `x` should be updated to the next element in the list. Since the current iteration has already processed one element, we can adjust `x` to represent the second element in `args` and ensure `args` has at least 2 elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all `i` from 1 to `n`; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in the list `args`**
