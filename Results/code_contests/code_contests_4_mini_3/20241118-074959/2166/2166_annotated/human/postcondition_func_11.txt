The function accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of its digits as integers. The digits are not distinct; if `n` contains repeated digits, they will appear multiple times in the returned list. The function does not impose any restrictions on the sign of `n`, so it can also handle negative integers, but the negative sign will not be included in the output list.
