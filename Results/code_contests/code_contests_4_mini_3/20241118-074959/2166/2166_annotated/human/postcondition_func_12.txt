The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `r` (a non-negative integer), and returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r), which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` distinct elements. If `r` is greater than `n`, the function will return 0, as it is not possible to choose more elements than are available. Additionally, if `n` is 0 and `r` is also 0, the function will return 1, representing the single way to choose nothing from nothing.
