The function does not accept any parameters. It generates a list `b` from another list `a` in an alternating order starting from the last element to the first. It then counts the number of local minima in the list `b` (elements smaller than their immediate neighbors) and passes this count to `func_20`. Finally, it also passes all elements of list `b` to `func_20`. If `n` is less than 1, the list `b` will be empty, and no local minima will be counted. If `n` is less than 2, the local minima counting loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0.
