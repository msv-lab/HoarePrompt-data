The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`. It returns the result of integer division `x // y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns `x // y + 1`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` equals 1 by returning `x`, and in cases where `x` is less than `y`, it ensures that it returns 1 as the result of the integer division will be 0 and adding 1 gives a positive integer. However, the code does not specify any behavior for cases where `y` is equal to 0, which could lead to a division by zero error. Therefore, in practice, the function should be used with the assumption that `y` is always greater than 0.
