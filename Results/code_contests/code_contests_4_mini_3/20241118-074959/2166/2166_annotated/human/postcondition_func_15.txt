The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the last non-zero value of `y` if `y` was greater than 0; otherwise, it returns the unchanged value of `x`. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will return 0, which is an edge case not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.
