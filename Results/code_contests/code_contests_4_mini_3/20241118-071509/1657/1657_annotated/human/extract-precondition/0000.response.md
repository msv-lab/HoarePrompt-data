Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of blogs (1 ≤ n ≤ 500,000), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of references (0 ≤ m ≤ 500,000), arr is a list of tuples containing pairs of integers (a, b) representing bidirectional references between blogs (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b), and topic is a list of n integers where each integer t_i represents the desired topic number for blog i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n).**
