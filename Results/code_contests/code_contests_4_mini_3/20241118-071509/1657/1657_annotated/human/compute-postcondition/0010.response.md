According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. The loop will continue as long as there are more tuples in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least one tuple, and `a` is the first element of the next tuple in `arr`, while `b` is the second element.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more tuple in `arr` beyond the current index. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr` contains at least two tuples, and we can set `a` and `b` to represent the next tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `a` is the first element of the second tuple in `arr`, `b` is the second element of the second tuple in `arr`**
