Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, and `a` is the first element of the next tuple in `arr`, while `b` is the second element. If `topic[a - 1]` is equal to `topic[b - 1]`, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, the function does nothing and no changes are made to any variables.***
