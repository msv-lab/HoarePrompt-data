According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are tuples remaining in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least two tuples, which indicates that there is at least one more tuple to process.

Since the loop processes each tuple `(a, b)` in `arr` sequentially, after the last iteration, the next tuple to be processed will be the third tuple in the list. However, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still tuples left in `arr`.

Given that `arr` originally had at least two tuples, after one iteration there will be at least one tuple left. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop will be processing the next tuple in `arr`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `a` is the first element of the next tuple in `arr`, `b` is the second element of the next tuple in `arr`**
