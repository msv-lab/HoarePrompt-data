The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of blogs, constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 500,000.
- `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of references, constrained by 0 ≤ m ≤ 500,000.
- `arr` is a list of tuples containing pairs of integers (a, b), which represent bidirectional references between blogs, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.
- `topic` is a list of n integers, where each integer t_i represents the desired topic number for blog i, constrained by 1 ≤ t_i ≤ n.

The function has multiple output cases:
- Case_1: If `m` is greater than 0 and `arr` contains at least one tuple, for each tuple (a, b) in `arr`, if the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` are the same, the function returns -1. If no tuples in `arr` have the same topic for the corresponding indices, the function does not return a value. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute and the function does not return anything.
- Case_2: If the first case is not fulfilled, the program returns a string of numbers from 1 to n, joined by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters that define blogs and their topics, and to either return -1 if there are conflicting topics in the references or return a string of numbers representing the blogs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, arr, and topic, and returns -1 if there are conflicting topics in the references. If there are no conflicts, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n, joined by spaces.**
