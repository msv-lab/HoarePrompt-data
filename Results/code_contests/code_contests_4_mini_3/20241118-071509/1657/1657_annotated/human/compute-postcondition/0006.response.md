Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, and `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples where each tuple (a, b) has 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. If the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are the same, the function returns -1; otherwise, there is no return value from the function. This assumes that `a` and `b` are valid indices based on the constraints given.***
