Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, and `arr` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple where each tuple (a, b) has 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. If the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are the same, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function does not return a value.***
