According to the code, the for loop iterates over the `arr`, which is a list of tuples containing pairs of integers. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one tuple. 

Given the initial state, we have:
- `n` is a positive integer (which is not directly relevant for the loop execution),
- `m` is a non-negative integer (this indicates the number of references),
- `arr` is a list of tuples containing pairs (a, b), and
- `topic` is a list of integers (also not directly relevant for the loop execution).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `arr` has at least one tuple. If `m` is greater than 0, it suggests that there should be references in `arr`, assuming the references are stored correctly.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
1. `arr` is a list with at least one tuple.
2. The values (a, b) in the tuples of `arr` should be valid, i.e., they fall within the range (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) and a ≠ b.

Therefore, we can summarize the required states:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and each tuple (a, b) has 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.**
