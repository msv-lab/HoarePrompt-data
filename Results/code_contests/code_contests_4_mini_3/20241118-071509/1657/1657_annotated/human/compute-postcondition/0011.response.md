Output State: **If `m` is greater than 0 and `arr` contains at least one tuple, then for each tuple (a, b) in `arr`, if the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` are the same, the function returns -1. If no tuples in `arr` have the same topic for the corresponding indices, the function does not return a value. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute and the function does not return anything.**
