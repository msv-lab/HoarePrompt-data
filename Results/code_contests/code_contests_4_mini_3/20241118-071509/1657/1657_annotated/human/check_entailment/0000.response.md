Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically:

1. The program only checks if any pair of blogs connected by a reference has the same desired topic. If they do, it returns -1 immediately. However, this does not account for the scenario where a valid writing order exists despite some blogs having the same topic. The problem states that each blog must have a different topic from its already written neighbors, but the program fails to check the actual writing order against the neighbors when assigning topics.

2. The return statement simply outputs a string of numbers from 1 to n, without considering the required order in which blogs should be written based on the neighbor constraints and the desired topics. 

3. There are multiple possible outputs for the blog writing order, and the program does not attempt to generate a valid order based on the references and the topic constraints.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2
1 2
2 3
1 2 3
```
Here, blogs 1 and 2 have the same topic (1), which means the program would return -1. However, a valid order could be `2, 1, 3` which respects the neighbor constraints. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
