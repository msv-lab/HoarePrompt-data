The function accepts integers `n` and `m`, a list of tuples `arr`, and a list `topic`. It checks if any topics corresponding to the indices in the tuples in `arr` are the same; if they are, it returns -1. If no conflicts are found and `m` is greater than 0, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to `n` joined by spaces. If `m` is 0, the function does not enter the loop and also does not return any value, which could be seen as returning `None`.
