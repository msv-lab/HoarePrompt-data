Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the way it checks for the validity of the topic assignments based on references. Specifically, the program only checks if any two directly connected blogs have the same topic and returns `-1` if they do. This check is insufficient because it fails to account for the more complex scenario where a blog's topic is determined by the topics of its neighbors after the blog has already been written.

For example, consider the following input scenario:

Input:
```
3 2
1 2
2 3
1 2 3
```

In this situation:
- Blog 1 references Blog 2.
- Blog 2 references Blog 1 and Blog 3.

According to the problem, Johnny would need to write the blogs in such a way that when writing Blog 2 (which references Blog 1), it cannot take the same topic as Blog 1 since it has already been written, which would require Blog 2 to choose a different topic. However, the program would return `-1` because Blog 1 and Blog 2 share the same topic, which is not a comprehensive check of the writing order or the references properly.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where valid writing orders exist, leading to incorrect outputs. The logic should involve maintaining a dynamic list of already written blog topics and ensuring that the current blog can select a topic that is not among its already written neighbors.

Since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case, the correctness is deemed false.
