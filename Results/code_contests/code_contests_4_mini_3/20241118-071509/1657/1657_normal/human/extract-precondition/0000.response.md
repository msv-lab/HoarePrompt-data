Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of blogs (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of references (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), arr is a list of tuples representing the bidirectional references between blogs (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b), and topic is a list of integers where each integer t_i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n) denotes the desired topic number for the i-th blog.**
