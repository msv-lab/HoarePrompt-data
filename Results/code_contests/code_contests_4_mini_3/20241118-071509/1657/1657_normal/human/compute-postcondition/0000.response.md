According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. The loop will iterate over the tuples in `arr`, so for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one tuple. The variables `a` and `b` will take values from the first tuple in the list during the first execution of the loop. 

Thus, to meet the requirements for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `a` is the first element of the first tuple in arr, `b` is the second element of the first tuple in arr**
