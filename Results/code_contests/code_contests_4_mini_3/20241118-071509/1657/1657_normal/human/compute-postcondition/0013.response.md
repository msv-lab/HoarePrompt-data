The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of blogs. The parameter `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of references. The parameter `arr` is a list of tuples that represent the bidirectional references between blogs, and the parameter `topic` is a list of integers that denote the desired topic number for each blog. 

The functionality of the function is as follows:

- Case 1: If `arr` is empty, the function proceeds without returning any value. If `arr` contains tuples, the function checks for each tuple `(a, b)` whether the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal. If any topics are found to be equal, the function returns -1. If no equal topics are found for all tuples in `arr`, the function does not return anything, indicating that no changes have occurred to `n`, `m`, or `arr`. 

- Case 2: If the loop executes and no equal topics are found, the program returns a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, joined by spaces.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (positive integer), m (non-negative integer), arr (list of tuples), and topic (list of integers). It returns -1 if any topics referenced in arr are equal; otherwise, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n joined by spaces.**
