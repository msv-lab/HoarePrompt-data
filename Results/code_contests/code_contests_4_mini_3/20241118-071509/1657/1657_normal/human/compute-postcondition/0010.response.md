According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` list. The loop will execute for each tuple in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 3 tuples. Since the loop iterates over the elements of `arr`, to execute one more time, the loop must process the next tuple. 

Given that `arr` has at least 3 tuples, if the loop has already processed 2 tuples, it will need to process the third tuple next. The variables `a` and `b` will represent the first and second elements of the next tuple, respectively.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that it will be processing the next tuple in `arr`, which means the index of the tuple should be incremented. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `a` and `b` represent the first and second elements of the third tuple in the list**.
