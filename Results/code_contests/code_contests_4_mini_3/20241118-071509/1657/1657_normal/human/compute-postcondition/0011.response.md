Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least 0 tuples. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function proceeds without returning -1. If the loop executes, for each tuple `(a, b)` in `arr`, if the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal for all tuples in `arr`, the function does not return anything, thus no changes occur to `n`, `m`, or `arr`. If `arr` contains at least one tuple and no equal topics are found, the output remains unchanged after the loop.**
