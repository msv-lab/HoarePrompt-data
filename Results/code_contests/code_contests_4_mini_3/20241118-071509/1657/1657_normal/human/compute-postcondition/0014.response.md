Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `m`, a list of tuples `arr`, and a list `topic`. It checks if any topics referenced in `arr` are equal; if so, it returns -1. If no equal topics are found for all tuples in `arr`, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, joined by spaces. If `arr` is empty, the function proceeds to return the string without returning -1. **
