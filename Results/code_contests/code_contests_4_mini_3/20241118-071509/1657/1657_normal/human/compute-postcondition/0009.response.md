Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list containing at least 3 tuples. If the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, the function does not return any value, thus no changes occur to `n`, `m`, or `arr`.***
