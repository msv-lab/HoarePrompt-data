Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple. If the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, there is no return value from the function.***
