The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `stack` has an additional element which is `s[2]` ('S' or 'T') and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
