Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input consisting of characters 'S' and 'T', processes these characters in a stack-like manner, and counts the unmatched characters. Specifically, for every 'S' added to the stack, a subsequent 'T' will remove it if it is the last character in the stack. The function prints the number of unmatched 'S' and 'T' characters remaining in the stack after processing the entire string. If the input string is empty, the function will print 0. **
