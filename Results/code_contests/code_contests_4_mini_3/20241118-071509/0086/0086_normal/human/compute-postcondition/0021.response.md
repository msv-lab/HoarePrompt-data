Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 1, and `stack` is a list that contains `s[1]` if `s[1]` is 'S' or is empty if `len(stack) == 0`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty with its last element being 'S', the last element is removed from `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is empty or if `s[i]` is 'S', then `s[i]` is appended to `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `len(stack) > 0` without the last element being 'S', `stack` remains unchanged. Thus, after execution, `stack` accurately represents the balance of 'S' and 'T' as dictated by the conditions provided. In cases where `s[i]` is 'T' and does not find a matching 'S' to pop, the stack's integrity is preserved, reflecting all edge scenarios.***
