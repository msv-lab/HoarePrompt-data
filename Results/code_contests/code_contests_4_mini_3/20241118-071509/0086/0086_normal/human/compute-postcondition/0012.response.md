Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters. `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, and `stack` is either empty after popping the last element 'S' if `stack` was not empty or contains 'T' if `stack` was empty before executing the statement. The state of `stack` reflects the operation performed based on the last character of the stack.***
