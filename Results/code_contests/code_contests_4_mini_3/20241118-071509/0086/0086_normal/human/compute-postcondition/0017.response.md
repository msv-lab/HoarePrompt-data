Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 1, and `stack` is a list that either contains `s[1]` if `s[1]` is 'S' or remains empty if `len(stack) == 0`. If `len(stack) == 0` or `s[i] == 'S'`, `s[i]` is appended to `stack`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `len(stack) > 0`, then `stack` remains unchanged.***
