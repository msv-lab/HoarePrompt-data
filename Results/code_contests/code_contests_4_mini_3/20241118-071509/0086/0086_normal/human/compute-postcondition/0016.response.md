The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables in the current state. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 1, and `stack` contains `s[1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
