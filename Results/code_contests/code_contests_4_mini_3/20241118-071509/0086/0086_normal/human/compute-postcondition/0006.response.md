Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, and `stack` is an empty list. If `stack` is empty or if the character at `s[i]` is 'S', then `s[i]` is appended to `stack`, which results in `stack` containing the character 'S' and causes the loop to continue to the next iteration. If `s[i]` is 'T', the condition does not hold true, and there is no action taken on `stack`.***
