Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, and `stack` is an empty list. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty, the last 'S' is removed from `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is empty, `T` is appended to `stack`. Thus, after the execution of the program fragment, `stack` will contain either 'T' if it was initially empty or remain unchanged if it contained 'S' before the operation and had one 'S' popped. In the case that `s[i]` is not 'T', no change occurs to `stack`.***
