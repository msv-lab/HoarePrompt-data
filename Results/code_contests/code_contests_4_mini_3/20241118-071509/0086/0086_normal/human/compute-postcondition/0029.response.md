Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters. `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, and `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty with `stack[-1]` being 'S', then `stack` will have its last element removed. If `s[2]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty with `stack[-1]` not being 'S', or if `stack` was originally empty and `s[2]` is 'T', then `stack` remains unchanged or empty. If `s[2]` is 'S', and `stack` was originally empty, `s[2]` is appended to `stack`. If `stack` was not empty and `s[2]` is 'S', an additional 'S' is appended to `stack`. Overall, the state of `stack` will reflect these conditions based on the value of `s[2]` and its relation to the existing elements in the `stack`.***
