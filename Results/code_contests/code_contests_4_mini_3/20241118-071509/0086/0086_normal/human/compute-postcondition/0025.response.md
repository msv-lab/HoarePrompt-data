Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `stack` will have an additional element, which is `s[2]` ('S' or 'T'), if either `stack` was originally empty or `s[2]` is 'S'. If `stack` was not empty and `s[2]` is 'T', then `stack` remains unchanged and the iteration continues.***
