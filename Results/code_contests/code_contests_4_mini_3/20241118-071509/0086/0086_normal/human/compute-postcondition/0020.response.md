Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length containing exactly half 'S' characters and half 'T' characters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is 1, and `stack` is a list that contains `s[1]` if `s[1]` is 'S' or is empty if `len(stack) == 0`. If `stack` is not empty and its last element is 'S', then the last element is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty or if `s[i]` is 'S', `s[i]` is appended to `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `len(stack) > 0`, then `stack` remains unchanged. Thus, after the execution, `stack` reflects the proper balance of 'S' and 'T' based on the conditions stated.***
