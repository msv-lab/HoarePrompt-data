Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `stack` is an empty list at the start. If `len(stack) == 0` or `s[i] == 'S'`, then `s[i]` is appended to `stack`, resulting in `stack` containing 'S' if `s[i]` was 'S'. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `s[i]` is 'T', the condition does not hold, and `stack` remains unchanged.***
