Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `stack` is a list that may contain 'S', 'T', or be empty. If `stack` is empty or `s[i]` is 'S', `stack` will contain one additional element which is `s[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1 while continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If `stack` is not empty and `s[i]` is 'T', the state of `stack` remains unchanged, and `i` is still incremented by 1 before proceeding to the next iteration.***
