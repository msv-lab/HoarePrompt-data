Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input consisting of characters 'S' and 'T'. It processes the string by maintaining a stack where 'S' characters are always added, and 'T' characters are conditionally processed to remove the last 'S' if it exists. After processing the entire string, the function prints the length of the stack, which represents the number of remaining characters after applying the specified rules. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or where the input does not contain an equal number of 'S' and 'T' characters, which could lead to unexpected results. **
