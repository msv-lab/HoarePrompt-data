Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `stack` is a list that may contain 'S', 'T', or be empty. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is 'S', then 'S' is removed from `stack`, potentially leaving it empty. If the last element of `stack` is not 'S', 'T' is appended to `stack`, making 'T' the last element. In all cases, if `s[i]` is not 'T', `stack` remains unchanged. Overall, after execution, `stack` either remains unchanged, becomes empty, or contains 'T' as its last element, depending on the conditions met during the execution.***
