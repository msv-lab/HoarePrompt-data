Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, then after the loop executes, `stack` contains the characters that remain after processing `s` according to the rules defined. If `s[i]` is 'S', it is always appended to `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T', it checks the last element of `stack`: if it is 'S', 'S' is removed; if `stack` is empty or the last element is 'T', 'T' is appended to `stack`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `stack` remains empty. The final state of `stack` will depend on the sequence of 'S' and 'T' in `s`. There is a risk of an IndexError if `i` exceeds the length of `s`, which should be avoided by ensuring the loop only runs while `i` is less than `n`.**
