Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `stack` is a list that may contain 'S', 'T', or be empty. If the last element of `stack` is 'S', it is removed; otherwise, if `stack` is either empty or its last element is 'T', the current character `s[i]` (which is 'T') is appended to `stack`. Thus, if `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty, the potential removal of an 'S' occurs, or the 'T' is added to the stack, depending on the last element of the stack, ensuring the stack accurately reflects the processed characters according to the rules defined.***
