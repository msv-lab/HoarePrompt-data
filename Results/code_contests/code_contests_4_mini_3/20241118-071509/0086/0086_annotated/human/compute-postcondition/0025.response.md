Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list that may contain 'S', 'T', or be empty, and `i` is equal to the length of `s`. If `stack` is empty or the character at index `i` of `s` is 'S', the character at index `i` will be appended to `stack`, and the loop will continue to the next iteration. If `i` exceeds the length of `s`, an IndexError may occur, which needs to be handled appropriately.***
