Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `s[i]` is 'T'. If the last element of `stack` was 'S', it is removed, resulting in `stack` being unchanged or empty. If the last element of `stack` was not 'S', then 'T' is appended to `stack`, making the last element of `stack` 'T'. Thus, after execution, `stack` either remains unchanged, becomes empty, or contains 'T' as its last element.***
