Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `stack` is a list that may contain 'S', 'T', or be empty. If the last element of `stack` is 'S', it is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty or the last element is 'T', the element `s[i]` is appended to `stack`, thus ensuring that the state of `stack` reflects the conditions of the last processed character, either by removing 'S' or adding the next character from `s`.***
