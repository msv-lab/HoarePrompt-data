The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`c` and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `c` is 0, `i` is equal to the next iteration index, and an element `a[c]` has been appended to `order`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `c` is 0, `i` is equal to the next iteration index, and an element `a[c]` has been appended to `order**
