Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks, otherwise `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and then both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, with `count` also being increased by 1. In all cases, `lol` is an empty list after the execution of the block.***
