Postcondition: ***`count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0])` and after execution, if `c` equals `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being greater than or equal to 1. If `c` is not equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is incremented by 1, ensuring that `count` remains greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1`.***
