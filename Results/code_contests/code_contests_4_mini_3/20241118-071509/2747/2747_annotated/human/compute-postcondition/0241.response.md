The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: a positive integer.
- `l`: a positive integer less than or equal to \(10^{18}\).
- `k`: a positive integer such that \(n \times k\) is less than or equal to \(10^{6}\).
- `a`: an array containing `n` positive integers, each greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to \(10^{9}\).

The function's output is not explicitly provided in the prompt. Therefore, without additional information regarding the output, it can be inferred that the function processes these parameters in some manner, but the specific return value is not detailed.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `l`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to \(10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(n * k\) is less than or equal to \(10^{6}\), and `a` is an array of `n` positive integers each between 1 and \(10^{9}\). The specific return value is not provided.**
