The code appends `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. The previous values of the affected variables are `temp` which has a new element appended and `lol` which is updated by including the value of `temp[0][0]`. The state of `count` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `lol`.

Output State: **`count` is decremented by 1; `temp` has a new element appended: [order[i], order[count]]; `lol` now includes the value of `temp[0][0]**
