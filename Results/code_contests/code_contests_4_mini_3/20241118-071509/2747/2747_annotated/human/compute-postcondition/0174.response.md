The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is `len(order) - 1`, so after execution, `count` will be equal to `len(order)`. The states of `temp` and `lol` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order)`; `temp` is an empty list; `lol` is now an empty list**
