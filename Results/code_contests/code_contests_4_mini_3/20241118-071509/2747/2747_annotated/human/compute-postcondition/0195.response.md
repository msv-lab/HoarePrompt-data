The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and since `count` is initially 0, the new value of `count` will be 1. The variables `same`, `temp`, and `lol` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `same` contains unique pairs from `order`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `same` contains unique pairs from `order`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
