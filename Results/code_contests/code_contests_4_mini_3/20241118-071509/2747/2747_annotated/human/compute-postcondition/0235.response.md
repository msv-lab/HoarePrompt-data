Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` exists in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are both reset to empty lists. If `len(same)` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, which may also include `temp[0][0]` depending on the check against `int(inp[1])`.***
