According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count` and the length of `order`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `count` must be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `count` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`.

Since `count` has just been incremented, it currently is equal to `len(order)`. Thus, to allow the loop to execute again, `count` needs to be set to `len(order) - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`count` is `len(order) - 1`**
