Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that `n * k` is less than or equal to 10^6, `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the raw input, `inp[1]` is a positive integer string, `order` contains the first element of `a`, `same` is an empty list, `c` is reset to 0 if it was equal to the length of `a` minus 1, or incremented by 1 otherwise, and `count` is increased by 1 in both cases; also, `int(inp[0])` remains at least equal to `count + 1` to allow the loop to execute again.***
