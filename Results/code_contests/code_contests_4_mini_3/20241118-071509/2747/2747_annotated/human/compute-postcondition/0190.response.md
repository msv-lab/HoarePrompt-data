The code appends the second element of the first pair in `temp` to the list `lol`. The initial state indicates that `temp` contains one new pair `[order[i], order[0]]`. Therefore, `temp[0][1]` is equal to `order[0]`. The variable `lol` will be updated to include this value.

Since `count`, `same`, and `temp` are not directly affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged.

The output state summarizes the values of the variables after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` contains unique pairs from `order`, `temp` contains one new pair [order[i], order[0]], `lol` contains the value order[0]**
