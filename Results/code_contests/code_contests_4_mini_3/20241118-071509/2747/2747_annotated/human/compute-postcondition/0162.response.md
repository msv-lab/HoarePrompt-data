Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` includes the pair [order[i], order[count]], and `lol` is updated to include both temp[0][1] and temp[0][0]. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of inp[1], the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, ensuring that the program handles the case where `same` matches the specified length.***
