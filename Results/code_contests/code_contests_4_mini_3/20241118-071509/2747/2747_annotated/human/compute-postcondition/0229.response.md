The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is decremented by 1; `temp` has a new element appended: [order[i], order[count]]; `lol` now includes the value of `temp[0][0] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
