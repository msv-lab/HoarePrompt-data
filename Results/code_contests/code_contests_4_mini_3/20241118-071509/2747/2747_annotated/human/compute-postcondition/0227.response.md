The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was decremented by 1, but its specific value is not known. The variables `temp` and `lol` remain unaffected as they are empty lists. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is incremented by 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
