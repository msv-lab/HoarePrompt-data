The code appends the second element of the first list in `temp` to the list `lol`. The value of `temp` is `[order[i], order[count]]`, which means `temp[0][1]` is the second element of `temp`, specifically `order[count]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `order` contains int(inp[1]) elements, `temp` now contains one list [order[i], order[count]], `lol` contains the value of order[count], and `same` contains unique values.

Output State: **`count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `order` contains int(inp[1]) elements, `temp` now contains one list [order[i], order[count]], `lol` contains order[count], and `same` contains unique values**
