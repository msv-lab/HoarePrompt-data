Postcondition: ***`count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0])`, which is greater than or equal to 0, and `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0. After executing the program fragment, `count` is incremented by 1. If `c` was equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0; otherwise, `c` is increased by 1. Thus, `c` is either 0 or one greater than its previous value, depending on the initial state of `c`.***
