Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to int(inp[0]) then count` is equal to `count + 1`, and `c` is either reset to 0 if it was equal to the length of `a` minus 1, or incremented by 1 otherwise. If count exceeds `int(inp[0])`, the loop terminates. If `int(inp[0])` is less than 1 or if `a` is empty (which would lead to an error when checking the length), the loop does not execute, leaving `count` at 0 and `c` at 0.**
