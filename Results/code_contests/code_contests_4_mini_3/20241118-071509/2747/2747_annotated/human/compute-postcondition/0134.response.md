The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means it remains an empty list. The states of the other variables (`count`, `order`, `same`, and `lol`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
