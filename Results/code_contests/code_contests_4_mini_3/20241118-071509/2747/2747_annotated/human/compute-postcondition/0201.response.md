The `same` list is updated by appending `temp[0]` to it. Since it is stated that `temp[0]` is not in `same`, this means that `temp[0]` is a unique value being added to `same`. The other variables `count`, `lol`, and `temp` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `temp[0]` to `same`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` contains unique pairs from `order` plus `temp[0]`, `temp` contains the pair [order[i], order[0]], and `lol` contains the value order[0] and temp[0][0] appended to it.**
