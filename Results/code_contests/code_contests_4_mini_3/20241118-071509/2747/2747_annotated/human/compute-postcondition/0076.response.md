Output State: **If count is less than or equal to int(inp[0]), then after the loop executes count is equal to int(inp[0]) + 1, and c will be either 0 (if it wrapped around from the last index of a) or one greater than its previous value. The value of int(inp[0]) remains greater than or equal to 0, and int(inp[1]) continues to be greater than 0. If count starts at 0, the loop will execute int(inp[0]) + 1 times, and if count starts greater than int(inp[0]), the loop will not execute at all and count remains unchanged.**
