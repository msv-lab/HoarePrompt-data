Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)` plus 1 if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, resulting in `temp` and `lol` being empty lists. If neither is in `same` and the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, while `temp` and `lol` become empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
