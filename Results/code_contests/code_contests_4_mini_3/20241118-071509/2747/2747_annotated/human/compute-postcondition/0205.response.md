Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists. If `len(same)` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists. The value of `same` contains unique pairs from `order`, and `lol` is empty after execution.***
