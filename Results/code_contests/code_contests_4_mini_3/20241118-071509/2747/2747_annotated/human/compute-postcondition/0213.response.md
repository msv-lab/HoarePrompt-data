The `pass` statement does not change any variable values or the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state. The variable values are still as follows: `count` is `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
