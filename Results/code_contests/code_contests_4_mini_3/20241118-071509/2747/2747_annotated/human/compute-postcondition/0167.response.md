Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)`, and if `temp[0]` is present in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are again reset to empty lists, with `count` increased by 1. Thus, `same` will only include `temp[0]` if the length of `same` does not reach `int(inp[1])` before `count` reaches `len(order)`.***
