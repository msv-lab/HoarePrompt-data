The code `lol.append(temp[0][0])` appends the value of `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. The previous state of `lol` is not specified, so we can only state that a new element is added to it. The state of `count` and `temp` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is `len(order) - 2`, `temp` contains one new pair from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` and now also includes `temp[0][0]`.

Output State: **`count` is `len(order) - 2`, `temp` contains one new pair from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` and now also includes `temp[0][0]`**
