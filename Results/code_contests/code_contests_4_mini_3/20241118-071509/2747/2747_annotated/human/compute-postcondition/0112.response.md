The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of `count`, `order`, `temp`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `same` is updated to include `temp[0]`.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `same` is updated to include `temp[0]**
