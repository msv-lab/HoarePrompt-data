The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, which means it is now initialized and contains no elements. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, so `count` remains 0, `same` still contains unique pairs from `order`, `temp` is still an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `same` contains unique pairs from `order`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` contains unique pairs from `order`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
