The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, which means it retains its previous state as an empty list. The values of the other variables (`count`, `order`, `same`, and `temp`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
