`lol` is appended with the value of `temp[0][1]`. The value of `temp` is [[order[i], order[0]]], so `temp[0][1]` refers to `order[0]`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` contains [[order[i], order[0]]], and `lol` contains the value of `order[0]`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` contains [[order[i], order[0]]], and `lol` contains `order[0]`**
