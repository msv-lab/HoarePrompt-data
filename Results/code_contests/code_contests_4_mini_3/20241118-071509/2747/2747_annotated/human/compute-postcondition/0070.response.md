The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `count` (which is greater than or equal to 0) and `int(inp[1])` (which is greater than 0). The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) - 1, which is greater than or equal to 0; `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) - 1, which is greater than or equal to 0; `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0; `c` is 0**
