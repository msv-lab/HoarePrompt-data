Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is present in `same`, then both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. If neither is present and the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop is exited. Otherwise, `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, and `temp[0]` is appended to `same`. In all cases, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, and edge cases include situations where `temp` is empty at the time of appending to `same`, which may lead to invalid states.***
