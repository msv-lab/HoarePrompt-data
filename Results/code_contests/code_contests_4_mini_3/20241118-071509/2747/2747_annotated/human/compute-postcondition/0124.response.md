Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, and `temp` includes a new list with elements `[order[i], order[count]]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop, and the last element of `order` is appended to `lol`, along with the first element of `temp`. This ensures that when the condition is met, the program state reflects the updates made to `lol` and the structure of `temp`.***
