The variable `c` is initialized to 0. Since this is an assignment operation, it does not affect any other variables. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that n * k is less than or equal to 10^6, `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the raw input, `inp` is a list of input strings from raw input, `order` is an empty list, `same` is initialized as an empty list, and `c` is 0.
