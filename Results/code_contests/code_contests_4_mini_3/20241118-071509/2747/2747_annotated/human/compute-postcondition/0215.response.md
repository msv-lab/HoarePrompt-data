Postcondition: ***`count` is `len(order) - 2`, `temp` contains one new pair from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, and `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` along with `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to the second element of `inp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the condition for breaking has been met. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution continues without breaking, which means the loop remains active and the state of `same` is unchanged in this specific execution.***
