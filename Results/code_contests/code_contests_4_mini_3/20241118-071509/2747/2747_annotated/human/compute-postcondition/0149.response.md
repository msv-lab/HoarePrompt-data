The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list, which means it now contains no elements. The other variables `count`, `order`, and `same` remain unaffected as the assignment does not change their values. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` has one more element added, which is `temp[0]` (but `temp` is now empty, making this context potentially invalid). 

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` has one more element added, which is `temp[0]` (invalid as `temp` is empty)**
