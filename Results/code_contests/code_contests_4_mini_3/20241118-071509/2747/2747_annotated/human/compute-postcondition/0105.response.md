The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means it is now an empty list and does not hold any previous values. The previous values of `count`, `order`, and `temp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `order` contains int(inp[1]) elements, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `order` contains int(inp[1]) elements, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
