Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `count` is also incremented by 1. The value of `c` is thus either 0 or incremented by 1, and `count` is always incremented by 1 regardless of the condition.***
