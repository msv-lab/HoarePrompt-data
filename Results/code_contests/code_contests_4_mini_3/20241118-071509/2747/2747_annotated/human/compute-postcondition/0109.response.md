Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` contains a list with two elements `[order[i], order[count]]`, and `lol` contains `order[count]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, `lol` retains its original values plus `temp[0][0]`. If the condition is not met, the program continues executing without breaking.***
