Postcondition: ***`count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1`. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is also incremented by 1. In all cases, `count` will be greater than or equal to 1 after execution.***
