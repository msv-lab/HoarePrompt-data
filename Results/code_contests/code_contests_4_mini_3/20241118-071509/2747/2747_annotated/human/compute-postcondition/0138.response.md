The statement `lol.append(temp[0][0])` appends the first element of `temp[0]` to the list `lol`. The value of `temp[0]` is `[order[i], order[0]]`, and thus `temp[0][0]` is `order[i]`. The values of the other variables (`count`, `order`, `same`, and `temp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `lol` after the append operation.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` contains [[order[i], order[0]]], and `lol` contains `order[0]` and `order[i]` appended to it.**
