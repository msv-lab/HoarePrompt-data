Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to len(order) - 1 then count is equal to len(order), order contains int(inp[1]) elements, same will contain unique pairs from temp[0] if they are not already present, and both temp and lol will be empty lists. If count was initially greater than len(order) - 1, the loop does not execute, and count remains 0, same remains empty, and temp and lol are empty lists.`**
