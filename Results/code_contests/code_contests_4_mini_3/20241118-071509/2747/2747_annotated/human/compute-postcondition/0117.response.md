The value `temp[0][1]` represents the second element of the first sublist in `temp`. The variable `temp` is defined as a list containing `[order[i], order[count]]`. The value at `count` is `len(order) - 1`, which points to the last element of the `order` list. Therefore, `temp[0][1]` will be equal to `order[count]`, which is the last element of `order`.

The statement `lol.append(temp[0][1])` appends this last element of `order` to the list `lol`. Other variables (`count`, `order`, and `temp`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` now includes a new list with elements `[order[i], order[count]]`, and the last element of `order` is appended to `lol`.**
