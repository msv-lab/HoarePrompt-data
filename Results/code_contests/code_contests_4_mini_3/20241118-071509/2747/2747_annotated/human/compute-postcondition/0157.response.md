The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment and remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` has been updated as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` has been updated as specified in the initial state**
