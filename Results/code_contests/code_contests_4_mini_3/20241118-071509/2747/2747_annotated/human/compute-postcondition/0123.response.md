Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` now includes a new list with elements `[order[i], order[count]]`, and the last element of `order` is appended to `lol`, and the first element of `temp` is appended to `lol`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
