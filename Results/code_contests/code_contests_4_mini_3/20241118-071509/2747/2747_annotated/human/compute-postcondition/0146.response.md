The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is a list containing exactly `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` contains [[order[i], order[0]]], and `temp[0]` is not in `same`, and `lol` is not in `same`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
