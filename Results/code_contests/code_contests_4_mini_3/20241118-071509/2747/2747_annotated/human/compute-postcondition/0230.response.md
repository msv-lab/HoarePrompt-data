Postcondition: ***`count` is decremented by 1, `temp` has a new element appended as [order[i], order[count]], and `lol` now includes the value of `temp[0][0]` if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the program continues execution without any changes to `count`, `temp`, or `lol`.***
