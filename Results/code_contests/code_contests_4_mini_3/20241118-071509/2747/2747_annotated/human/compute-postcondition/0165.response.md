The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, which overwrites any previous value it had. In this case, `lol` is now an empty list, while the values of `count`, `temp`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` includes `temp[0]`.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` includes `temp[0]**
