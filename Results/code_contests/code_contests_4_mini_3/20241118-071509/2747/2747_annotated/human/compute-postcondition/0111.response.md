The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`. This assignment does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `count`, `order`, `lol`, and `same`, while `temp` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` is [], `lol` contains `order[count]`, and `same` is updated to include `temp[0]**
