The code initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` is now an empty list, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` is an empty list, and `same` is updated to include `temp[0]`**.
