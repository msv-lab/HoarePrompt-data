The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0])`, but does not provide the current value of `c`. Since the value of `c` is unknown, we state that `c` is increased by 1 without specifying its previous value. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0]) and `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0])` and `c` is increased by 1**
