The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list. The values of `count` and `temp` remain unchanged, as this operation only affects the variable `lol`. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is decremented by 1; `temp` is an empty list; `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is decremented by 1; `temp` is an empty list; `lol` is an empty list**
