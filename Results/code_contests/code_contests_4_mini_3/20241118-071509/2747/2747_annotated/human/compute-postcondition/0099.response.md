Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `c` is defined based on the number of iterations relative to the length of `a`, and `temp` and `lol` are both empty lists. If either `temp[0]` or `lol` is found in `same`, then no new elements are added to `same`. If the length of `same` reaches `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. This ensures that `same` contains unique values added from `temp[0]`, only when they are not already present.***
