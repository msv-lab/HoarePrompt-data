The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`c`, `i`, and `order`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `c` is now increased by 1, and `i` is the next iteration index, and an element `a[c]` has been appended to `order`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `c` is now increased by 1, `i` is the next iteration index, and an element `a[c]` has been appended to `order**
