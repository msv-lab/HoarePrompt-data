Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to int(inp[0]) then after the loop has executed count will be equal to int(inp[0]) + 1, and c will be reset to 0 if it was equal to the last index of array 'a', otherwise c will be incremented by the number of times the loop executed. If count starts from 0, the loop will execute int(inp[0]) + 1 times; if count is already greater than int(inp[0]), the loop will not execute at all and the values will remain as count = initial value of count (which is 0) and c will retain its initial value.**
