Postcondition: ***`count` is updated to `len(order) - 1`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, incrementing `count` by 1.***
