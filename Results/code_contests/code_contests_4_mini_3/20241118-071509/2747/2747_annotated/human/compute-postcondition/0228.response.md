The code contains the `pass` statement, which does nothing and does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same. 

The output state is: `count` is incremented by 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
