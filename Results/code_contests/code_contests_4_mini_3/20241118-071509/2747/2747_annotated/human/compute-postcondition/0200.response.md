Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `same` contains unique pairs from `order`, `temp` contains the pair [order[i], order[0]], `lol` contains the value order[0] and temp[0][0] appended to it, and neither `temp[0]` nor `lol` is in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking.***
