The variable `lol` is reassigned to an empty list, effectively clearing any previous contents it may have had. Since `lol` was previously defined to contain `order[0]` and `order[i]`, this means that those values are no longer present in `lol`. The other variables (`count`, `order`, `same`, `temp`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
