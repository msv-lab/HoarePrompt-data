The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is `len(order) - 2`, `temp` contains one new pair from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` and now also includes `temp[0][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
