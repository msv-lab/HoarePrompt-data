Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, and `same` is a list containing exactly `int(inp[1])` elements. If `same` reaches the length of `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, ensuring that `temp` contains [[order[i], order[0]]] with `temp[0]` not in `same`, and `lol` not in `same`. If `same` does not reach that length, the program continues without breaking.***
