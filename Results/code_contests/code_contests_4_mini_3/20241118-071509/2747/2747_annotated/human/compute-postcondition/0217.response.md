The statement `temp = []` assigns an empty list to `temp`, which means that the previous contents of `temp` are cleared. The other variables (`count`, `lol`, and `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` is now an empty list while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`count` is `len(order) - 2`, `temp` is [], `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` along with `temp[0][0]`, and `same` has one new element added from `temp[0]**
