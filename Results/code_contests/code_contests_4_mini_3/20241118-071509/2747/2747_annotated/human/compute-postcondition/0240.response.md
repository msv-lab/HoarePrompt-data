Given the initial state, the relevant variables are `count`, `same`, `order`, `temp`, and `lol`. 

The provided code calculates the expression `len(same) + len(order)`, and then takes this sum modulo `(pow(10, 9) + 7)`. 

1. If `int(inp[0])` is less than 1 or `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `count` at 0, `same` as an empty list, and both `temp` and `lol` as empty lists. Thus, `len(same)` is 0 and `len(order)` remains unchanged.

2. If `int(inp[0])` is 0, the loop executes once, `count` becomes 1, and `same` remains empty, so `len(same)` is still 0. The value of `len(order)` is unchanged.

3. If `int(inp[0])` is greater than 0, `count` will be at least `int(inp[0]) + 1`, and `same` will contain unique pairs from `order` until `len(same)` reaches `int(inp[1])`. The values of `temp` and `lol` would still be empty lists.

4. The final output is determined by the expression `len(same) + len(order)` modulo `(pow(10, 9) + 7)`.

Assuming `order` has not been modified and remains unchanged and the values of `count`, `same`, `temp`, and `lol` have been defined as per above scenarios, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`count` is either 0 or at least `int(inp[0]) + 1`; `same` is an empty list or contains unique pairs from `order`; `temp` is an empty list; `lol` is an empty list; the output of the expression is `len(same) + len(order)` % (10^9 + 7)**
