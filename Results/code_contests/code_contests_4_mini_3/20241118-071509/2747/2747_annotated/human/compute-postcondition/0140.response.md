The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means that any previous values stored in `temp` are cleared. The variable `count` remains unchanged at 0, `order` still contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` remains an empty list, and `lol` still includes `order[0]` and `order[i]`. The variables `temp[0] in same` and `lol in same` are not affected since `temp` is now empty. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` contains `order[0]` and `order[i]`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `same` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` contains `order[0]` and `order[i]`**
