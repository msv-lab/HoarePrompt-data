Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1, and `c` is updated to either 0 (if it was the last index of `a`) or incremented by 1 (if it was not). An element from `a` indexed by the updated value of `c` is appended to `order`. The values of `int(inp[0])` remain greater than or equal to 0, and `int(inp[1])` continues to be greater than 0.***
