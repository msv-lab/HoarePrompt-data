Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `c` is defined based on the number of iterations relative to the length of `a`, `temp` contains the element `[order[i], order[0]]`, `lol` includes `temp[0][0]`, and neither `temp[0]` nor `lol` are elements of `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues until the length of `same` reaches `int(inp[1])`.***
