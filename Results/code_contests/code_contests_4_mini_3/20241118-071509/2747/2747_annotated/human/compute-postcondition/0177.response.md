Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` has appended a new list [order[i], order[len(order) - 1]], and `lol` now contains an additional element `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining the state of `count`, `temp`, and `lol` as described. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program continues without breaking.***
