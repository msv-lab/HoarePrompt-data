Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are cleared while `count` is incremented by 1. Thus, in all cases, `lol` contains the original values plus `temp[0][0]`.***
