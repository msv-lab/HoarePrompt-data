The code snippet initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this line of code. Therefore, `count` remains equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` still contains `int(inp[1])` elements, and `lol` remains unchanged as it contains `order[count]`. The `temp` variable is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `order` contains int(inp[1]) elements, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains order[count]**
