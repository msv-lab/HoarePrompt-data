The code initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous values of `count`, `order`, and `lol` are not directly affected by this operation, but `temp` is now an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` contains `int(inp[1])` elements, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` remains unchanged**
