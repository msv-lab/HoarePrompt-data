The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `c` and `order` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `c` is 0, and an element from `a` indexed by `c` is appended to `order`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `c` is 0, and an element from `a` indexed by `c` is appended to `order**
