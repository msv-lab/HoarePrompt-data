Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and the conditions ensure that `count` reflects the total number of elements in `order`. Thus, `count` is equal to `len(order)` and `order` has at least `len(order)` elements throughout.***
