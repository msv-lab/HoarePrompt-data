The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means that `lol` will no longer reference the previous value of `order[i]`. The previous values of `count`, `order`, `temp`, and `same` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `lol`.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` has one more element which is `temp[0]`**
