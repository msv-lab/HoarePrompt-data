The line `temp = []` initializes `temp` as an empty list. This means that the previous content of `temp` is cleared, and it no longer contains any elements. The other variables (`order`, `count`, and `same`) remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made by the line of code.

Output State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is decremented by 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `same` has one more element added (temp[0]).**
