The code initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. Thus, the state of `count`, `order`, `lol`, and `same` remains the same. 

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains `order[i]`, `same` has one more element which is `temp[0]`**
