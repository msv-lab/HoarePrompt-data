Functionality: ** The function accepts user input consisting of two integers followed by a list of integers. It creates a list `order` by cycling through the input list a specified number of times based on the first integer. Then, it generates unique pairs from this `order` list until it reaches a specified limit based on the second integer. Finally, it computes and prints the total count of unique pairs combined with the length of `order`, taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not handle cases where the first integer is negative or zero, leading to no processing of pairs, and the second integer being set to zero will result in an empty `same` list but still prints the sum with `len(order)`.**
