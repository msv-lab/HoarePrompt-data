Output State: **`if int(inp[0]) is greater than or equal to 0 then count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1`, `c` is reset to 0 if it reaches `len(a) - 1` otherwise it is incremented by 1, `i` remains `k + 1`. If int(inp[0]) is less than 0, the loop doesn't execute and `count` remains 0, `c` is unchanged, and `i` is still `k + 1`.**
