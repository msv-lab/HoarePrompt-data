The `temp` variable is assigned an empty list `[]`, overwriting its previous value, which contained two elements: `[order[i], order[0]]` and `[order[i], order[count]]`. This means that `temp` now has no elements. The previous values of `lol`, `count`, and `same` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is now an empty list, `lol` remains unchanged, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is now an empty list, `lol` remains unchanged, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, and `same` remains unchanged.**
