Postcondition: ***`temp` contains three elements: either [order[i], order[0]], [order[i], order[count]], and [order[i], order[count]] or [order[i], order[0]], [order[i], order[count]], and [order[i], order[count]]. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is again incremented by 1.***
