Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[count]]`, `same` remains unchanged, `lol` includes `temp[0][1]` and `order[i]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the flow continues without any alterations to the variables.***
