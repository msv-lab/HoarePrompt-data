According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count` and the length of the `order` list. The loop will continue as long as `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` has been incremented by 1 during the loop body. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `count` must be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. 

Since `count` was incremented, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is still within the bounds of the loop condition. Specifically, `count` needs to be decreased by 1 to allow the loop to execute again. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `order` remains unchanged.

State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, count is decremented by 1**
