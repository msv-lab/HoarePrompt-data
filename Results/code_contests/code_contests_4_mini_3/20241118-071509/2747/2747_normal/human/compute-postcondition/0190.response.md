The statement `lol.append(temp[0][1])` appends the second element of the `temp` list (which is itself a list containing two elements) to the `lol` list. The first element of `temp` is `order[i]`, and the second element is `order[0]`. Since `temp` contains one element which is `[order[i], order[0]]`, `temp[0][1]` will be equal to `order[0]`. The initial state shows that `lol` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `lol` will contain the value of `order[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` contains one element which is [order[i], order[0]], and `lol` now contains the first element of `order`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` contains one element which is [order[i], order[0]], and `lol` contains `order[0]`**
