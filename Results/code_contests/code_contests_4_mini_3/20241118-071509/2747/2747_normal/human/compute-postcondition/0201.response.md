The code appends `temp[0]` to the list `same`. Since `temp[0]` is `[order[i], order[0]]`, this means that `same` will now include this element. The previous values of `count`, `order`, `temp`, `lol`, and `same` are not directly affected by this operation, except that `same` will now contain one additional element. The condition regarding the length of `same` and its relation to `inp[1]` is not affected here, as the code does not check or modify `same` based on that condition in this line.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` contains one element which is [order[i], order[0]], `lol` contains [order[0], order[i]], and `same` now includes `temp[0]`, which is [order[i], order[0]].**
