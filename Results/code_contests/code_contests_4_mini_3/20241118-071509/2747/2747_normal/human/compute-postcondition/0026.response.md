Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of strings, `inp` is a list of strings where `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `order` contains the first element of `a`, `same` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `count` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the program fragment, if `c` was equal to `len(a) - 1`, `c` is reset to 0, otherwise, `c` is increased by 1. In both cases, `count` is incremented by 1. It is ensured that `count` remains less than or equal to `int(inp[0])`.***
