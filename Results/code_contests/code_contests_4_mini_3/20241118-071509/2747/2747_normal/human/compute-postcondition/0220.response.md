Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)` and `order` has at least `len(order)` elements. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are both empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `lol` is updated to include both `temp[0][1]` and `order[i]` in the overall process.***
