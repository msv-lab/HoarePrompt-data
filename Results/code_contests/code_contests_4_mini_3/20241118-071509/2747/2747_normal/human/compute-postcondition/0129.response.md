Postcondition: ***`order` is a list with at least 1 element. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are both set to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, and `count` remains effectively unchanged.***
