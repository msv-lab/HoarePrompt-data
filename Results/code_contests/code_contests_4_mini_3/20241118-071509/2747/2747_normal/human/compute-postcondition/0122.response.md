The code snippet contains the `pass` statement, which does not change the values of any variables or affect the control flow of the program. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is incremented by 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
