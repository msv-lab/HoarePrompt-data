Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` contains one element which is [order[i], order[0]], `lol` contains [order[0], order[i]], and neither `temp[0]` is in `same` nor `lol` is in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the condition was met. If the length of `same` is not equal to `inp[1]`, the program continues without breaking.***
