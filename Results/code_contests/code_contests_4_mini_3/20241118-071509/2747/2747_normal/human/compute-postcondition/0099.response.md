Postcondition: ***`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is increased by 1, and `temp` and `lol` are both empty lists. If either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, no changes are made due to the pass statement. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`.***
