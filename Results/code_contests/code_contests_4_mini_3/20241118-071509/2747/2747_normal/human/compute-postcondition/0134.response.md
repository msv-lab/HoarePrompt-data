The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`. Since `temp` was already an empty list in the initial state, there are no changes to its content. The other variables (`lol`, `count`, `len(order)`, `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `len(order)` is at least 1, `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `len(order)` is at least 1, `same` remains unchanged**
