The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means it is now cleared of any previous elements. Other variables like `same` and `order` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `temp` and notes that `same` still contains an additional element `temp[0]` (though `temp[0]` is now undefined since `temp` is empty).

Output State: **`temp` is [], `same` contains an additional element which is `temp[0]` (undefined)**
