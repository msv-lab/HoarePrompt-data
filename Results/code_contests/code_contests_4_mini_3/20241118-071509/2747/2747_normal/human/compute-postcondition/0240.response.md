Output State: **`count` is at least 1, `temp` and `lol` are empty lists, `same` contains unique pairs until its length reaches int(inp[1]); if int(inp[1]) is 0 or less, or if len(order) is 0, `count` is 0, `temp` and `lol` are empty lists, and `same` is unchanged. The result of the print statement is len(same) + len(order) % (pow(10, 9) + 7)**
