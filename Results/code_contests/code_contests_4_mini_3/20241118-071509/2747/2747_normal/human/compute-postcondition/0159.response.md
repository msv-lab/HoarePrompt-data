The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown. The states of the other variables `temp` and `lol` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `count` is incremented by 1**
