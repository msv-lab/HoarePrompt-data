To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we start by analyzing the current conditions provided:

1. The loop will execute if `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`.
2. The variable `count` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
3. The loop will break if `len(same)` equals `int(inp[1])`.
4. If either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` will be cleared.
5. If `count` exceeds `len(order) - 1`, the loop will terminate naturally.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that:

- `count` must be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1` for the loop to execute again.
- If `len(same)` is already equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop would not execute again as it would break.

From the information provided, we need to increment `count` by 1 for the next iteration, and we need to ensure that `count` remains within the bounds of the length of `order`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments would be:

- We need to set `count` to its current value plus 1.
- Additionally, we need to ensure that `len(order)` is such that the new `count` does not exceed `len(order) - 1`.

Assuming `count` was the maximum value allowed for it to execute again, we need to ensure that `len(order)` is at least `count + 1` (which is the new value of `count` for the next iteration).

Thus, the adjusted state will reflect these changes.

State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 1, `len(order)` is at least `count + 1`, `same` remains unchanged**
