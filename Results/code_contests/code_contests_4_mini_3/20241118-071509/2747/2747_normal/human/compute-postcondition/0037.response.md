The variable `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `c`, `i`, and `order` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is now 1, `c` is less than `len(a) - 1`, `i` is k + 1, and an element from list `a` at index `c` is appended to `order`, and `c` is now `c + 1`.

Output State: **`count` is now 1, `c` is less than `len(a) - 1`, `i` is k + 1, and an element from list `a` at index `c` is appended to `order`, and `c` is now `c + 1**
