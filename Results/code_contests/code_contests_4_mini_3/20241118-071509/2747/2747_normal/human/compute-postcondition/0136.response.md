The code appends a list containing `order[i]` and `order[count]` to `temp`. Since `temp` is initially an empty list, it will now contain one element, which is the list `[order[i], order[count]]`. The value of `count` is 0, so `order[count]` refers to `order[0]`. The state of `lol`, `count`, and `same` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` contains one element which is the list `[order[i], order[0]]`, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` contains one element which is the list `[order[i], order[0]]`, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0, and `same` remains unchanged**.
