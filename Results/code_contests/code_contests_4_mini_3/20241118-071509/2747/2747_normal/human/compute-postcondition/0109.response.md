Postcondition: ***`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is `[[order[i], order[count]]]`, and `lol` contains the last element of `order` with `temp[0][0]` appended to it. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the lengths are not equal, the program continues execution without breaking.***
