Postcondition: ***`temp` contains two elements: either `[order[i], order[0]]` or `[order[i], order[count]]`. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are both set to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. If not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. The variable `same` remains unchanged in the first condition but is modified in the second when a new element is appended.***
