The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The initial state indicates that `temp` is an empty list, and `same` contains an additional element which is `temp[0]`, but since `temp` is empty, `temp[0]` is undefined. However, the assignment of `lol` does not affect `temp` or `same`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is [], `same` contains an additional element which is `temp[0]` (undefined), and `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`temp` is [], `same` contains an additional element which is `temp[0]` (undefined), and `lol` is an empty list**
