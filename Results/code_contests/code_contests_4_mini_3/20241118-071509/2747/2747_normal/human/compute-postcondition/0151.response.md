The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and since `count` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The states of the other variables, `temp`, `lol`, and `same`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is now an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is now an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1, and `same` remains unchanged**
