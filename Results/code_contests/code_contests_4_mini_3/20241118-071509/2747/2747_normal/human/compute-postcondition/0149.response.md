The code clears the list `temp`, which was initially containing one element, specifically `temp[0]` (i.e., `[order[i], order[0]]`). This operation does not affect the other variables (`lol`, `count`, and `same`) directly, but it results in `temp` being an empty list. Since `temp` is now empty, `temp[0]` will not exist anymore, but the state of `lol`, `count`, and `same` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is now an empty list, `lol` still contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, `count` is 0, `same` remains unchanged, and `temp[0]` is no longer accessible.

Output State: **`temp` is now an empty list, `lol` still contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, `count` is 0, `same` remains unchanged, and `temp[0]` is no longer accessible.**
