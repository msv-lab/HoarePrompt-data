Postcondition: ***`count` is 3, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` remains as `k + 1`, `int(inp[1])` is greater than `k + 1`, `order` has been appended with `a[c]`, and `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 2. If `c` was the last index of array `a` before the execution, it resets to 0; otherwise, it increments by 1.***
