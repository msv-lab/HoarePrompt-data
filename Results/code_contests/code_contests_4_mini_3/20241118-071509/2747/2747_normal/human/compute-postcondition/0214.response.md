The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[count]]`, `same` is unchanged, and `lol` is updated to include `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` is updated to include `order[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
