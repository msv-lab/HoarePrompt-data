The value of `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is either 0 or has been incremented by 1, after this operation, `c` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `k + 1`, and `int(inp[1])` is greater than `k + 1`, and `order` has been appended with `a[c]`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `k + 1`, `int(inp[1])` is greater than `k + 1`, and `order` has been appended with `a[c]`**
