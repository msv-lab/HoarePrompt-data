The `pass` statement does not change the state of any variables; it is a no-operation statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1, and `same` remains unchanged**
