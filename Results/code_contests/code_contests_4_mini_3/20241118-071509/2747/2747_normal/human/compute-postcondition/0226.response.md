The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, which means its previous value of `lol` (which contained `order[i]`) is overwritten. Other variables such as `count`, `order`, and `temp` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list**
