The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The values of the other variables (`temp`, `count`, `same`) remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `temp[0]` and `lol` being in `same` are still not applicable since `temp` is empty and `lol` is also an empty list. Therefore, the output state is `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0, and `same` remains unchanged.**
