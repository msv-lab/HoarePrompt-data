Postcondition: ***`temp` contains two elements: `[order[i], order[0]]` and `[order[i], order[count]]`; `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]`, `temp[0][0]`, and the new element `temp[0][0]` is appended to it; `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`; `same` remains unchanged. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur from this conditional check.***
