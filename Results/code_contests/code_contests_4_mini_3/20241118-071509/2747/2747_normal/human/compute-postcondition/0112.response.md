The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means that `lol` will now hold an empty list regardless of its previous state. The other variables `order`, `count`, `temp`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `lol` and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is [], `same` includes `temp[0]`, and `lol` is now an empty list `[]`**
