The `pass` statement does not change the state of the program or the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. The values of the variables are still as they were initially.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is now an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list**
