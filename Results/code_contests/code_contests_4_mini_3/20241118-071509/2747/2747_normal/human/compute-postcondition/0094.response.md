Postcondition: ***`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `c` is (int(inp[0]) + 1) % len(a), `i` is 0, `temp` is now [[order[0], order[0]]], and `lol` contains `order[0]` twice. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining that the first element of `temp` is not in `same`, and `lol` is also not in `same`. There are no changes to the other variables in this case.***
