The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` is [[order[i], order[count]]], and `lol` contains the last element of `order` with `temp[0][0]` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
