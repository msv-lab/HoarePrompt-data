The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, which does not change its previous state since it is now explicitly set to the empty list. The initial state indicates that `temp` is an empty list, `lol` remains unchanged, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, and `same` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any changes affecting `temp`, `count`, or `same`.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, and `same` remains unchanged**
