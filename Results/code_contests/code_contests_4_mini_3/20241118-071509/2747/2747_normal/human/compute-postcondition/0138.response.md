The code attempts to append `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. Initially, `temp` contains one element which is the list `[order[i], order[0]]`, meaning `temp[0][0]` is `order[i]`. The existing state of `lol` is that it contains the element `temp[0][1]`, which is `order[0]`. The variable `count` is 0, and `same` remains unchanged.

After executing the code, `lol` will now contain the original element plus the new element `temp[0][0]`, which is `order[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `temp` contains one element which is the list `[order[i], order[0]]`; `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`; `count` is 0; `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` contains one element which is the list `[order[i], order[0]]`; `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`; `count` is 0; `same` remains unchanged**
