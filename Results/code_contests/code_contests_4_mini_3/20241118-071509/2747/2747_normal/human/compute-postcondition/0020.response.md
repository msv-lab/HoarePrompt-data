Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of strings, `inp` is a list of strings where `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `order` contains the first element of `a`, `same` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `count` is incremented by 1, and `int(inp[0])` is at least equal to `count`. If `c` was equal to the length of `a` minus 1, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is still incremented by 1. Thus, `count` is guaranteed to be incremented regardless of the value of `c`, and `c` is updated based on its previous value.***
