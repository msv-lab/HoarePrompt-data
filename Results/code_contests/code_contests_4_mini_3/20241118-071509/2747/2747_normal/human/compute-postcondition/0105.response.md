The code assigns an empty list to `lol`, which means that the previous contents of `lol` are cleared. `order`, `count`, and `temp` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `lol` is now an empty list while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**.
