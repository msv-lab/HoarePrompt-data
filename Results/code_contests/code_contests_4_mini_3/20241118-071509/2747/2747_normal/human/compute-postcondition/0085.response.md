The code appends the first element of the `temp` list (which is `temp[0][0]`) to the `lol` list. The previous value of `temp` is `[[order[0], order[0]]]`, so `temp[0][0]` is equal to `order[0]`. As a result, `lol` now contains an additional instance of `order[0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `c` is `(int(inp[0]) + 1) % len(a)`, `i` is 0, `temp` is now [[order[0], order[0]]], and `lol` contains `order[0]` twice.

Output State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `c` is (int(inp[0]) + 1) % len(a), `i` is 0, `temp` is now [[order[0], order[0]]], and `lol` contains `order[0]` twice.**
