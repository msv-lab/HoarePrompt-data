Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to int(inp[0]) then after the loop executes the final value of count will be int(inp[0]) + 1, c will be equal to (int(inp[0]) mod len(a)) if (int(inp[0]) + 1) is greater than or equal to len(a), otherwise c will be equal to (int(inp[0]) + 1). If count starts above int(inp[0]), the loop will not execute and count will remain the same, and c will be 0.`**
