Postcondition: ***`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `c` is (int(inp[0]) + 1) % len(a), `i` is 0, `temp` is now [[order[0], order[0]]], and `lol` contains `order[0]` twice. The first element of `temp` is not in `same`, and `lol` is not in `same`.***
