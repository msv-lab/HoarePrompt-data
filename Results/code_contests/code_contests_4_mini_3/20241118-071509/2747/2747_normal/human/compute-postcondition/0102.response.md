The code appends `temp[0][1]` to the list `lol`. The variable `temp` is defined as `[[order[i], order[count]]]`, which means `temp[0][1]` corresponds to `order[count]`. The value of `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, so `order[count]` refers to the last element of the list `order`. 

Since `lol` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `lol` will contain one element, which is the last element of the `order` list.

Therefore, the output state is: `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` is [[order[i], order[count]]], and `lol` contains the last element of `order`.

Output State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` is [[order[i], order[count]]], and `lol` contains the last element of `order`**
