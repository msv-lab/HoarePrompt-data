The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains two elements: `[order[i], order[0]]` and `[order[i], order[count]]`; `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]`, `temp[0][0]`, and the new element `temp[0][0]` is appended to it; `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`; `same` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
