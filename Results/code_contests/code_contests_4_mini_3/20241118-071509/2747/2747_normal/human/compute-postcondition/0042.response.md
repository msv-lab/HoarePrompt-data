The variable `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is either 0 or incremented by 1, after this operation, `c` will be either 1 (if it was initially 0) or 2 (if it was initially incremented by 1). The values of `count` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `k + 1`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `k + 1`**
