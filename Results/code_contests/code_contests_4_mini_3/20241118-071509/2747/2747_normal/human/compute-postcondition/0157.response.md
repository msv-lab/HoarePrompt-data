The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`. This means that the previous contents of `temp`, which included two elements, are cleared. The variables `lol`, `count`, and `same` remain unchanged as there are no operations affecting them in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` is now empty while the other variables maintain their previous values.

Output State: **`temp` is [], `lol` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, and `same` remains unchanged**.
