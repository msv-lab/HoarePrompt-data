The `pass` statement does not change the state of any variables; it is simply a placeholder that allows for a block of code to be syntactically correct without performing any action. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

The output state is: `temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `count` is incremented by 1**
