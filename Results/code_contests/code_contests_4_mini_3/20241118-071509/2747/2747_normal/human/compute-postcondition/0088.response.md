The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list. Since `lol` was previously a list containing `order[0]` twice, it is now replaced with an empty list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `c` is (int(inp[0]) + 1) % len(a), `i` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`.

Output State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `c` is (int(inp[0]) + 1) % len(a), `i` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`.**
