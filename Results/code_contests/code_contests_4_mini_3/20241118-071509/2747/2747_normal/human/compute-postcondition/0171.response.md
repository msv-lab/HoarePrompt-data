The variable `temp` contains three elements, and the first element of `temp` is a list where `temp[0][0]` is accessed. A value from `temp[0][0]` is appended to the list `lol`. The previous state of `lol` is not specified, but it has had a value appended to it, indicating it has one more element than before.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `lol` after the append operation, while also indicating the contents of `temp`.

Output State: **`temp` contains three elements: either [order[i], order[0]], [order[i], order[count]], and [order[i], order[count]] or [order[i], order[0]], [order[i], order[count]], and [order[i], order[count]]; `lol` has a new element appended from `temp[0][0]**
