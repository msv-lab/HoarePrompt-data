The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. Since `lol` was already an empty list, its value remains unchanged. The other variables `temp`, `count`, and `same` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `len(order)` is at least 1, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `len(order)` is at least 1, and `same` remains unchanged**
