Postcondition: ***`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is decremented by 1, and `temp` contains elements from `order[i]` and `order[count]`. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` does not equal `int(inp[1])`, the program continues executing without breaking. Additionally, `lol` includes `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]` regardless of whether the break occurs or not.***
