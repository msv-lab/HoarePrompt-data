Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to int(inp[0]) then count is equal to int(inp[0]) + 1, c is equal to (count - 1) % len(a), i remains as k + 1, int(inp[1]) is still greater than k + 1, and order has been appended with a[c] for each increment of count. If count starts at 0 and int(inp[0]) is 0, the loop executes once, and c is either incremented or reset to 0 based on its previous value; if int(inp[0]) is less than 0, the loop does not execute, leaving count at 0, c unchanged, and order unchanged.**
