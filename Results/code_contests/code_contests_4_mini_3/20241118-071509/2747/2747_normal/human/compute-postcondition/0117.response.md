The code appends the second element (index 1) of the first element (index 0) of the `temp` list to the `lol` list. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `temp` is a list containing at least one element, which is formed from `order[i]` and `order[count]`. Therefore, `temp[0][1]` refers to the second element of the first element in `temp`.

Since the values of `order`, `i`, and `count` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `lol`. However, we know that `lol` is being modified by adding this new element.

Output State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is decremented by 1, `temp` contains elements from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, and `lol` now includes `temp[0][1]`.**
