The variable `count` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `c` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `int(inp[1])` is greater than `k + 1`, and `order` has been appended with `a[c]`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `c` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `int(inp[1])` is greater than `k + 1`, and `order` has been appended with `a[c]`**
