Postcondition: ***`temp` contains one element which is the list `[order[i], order[0]]`; `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`; `count` is 0; `same` remains unchanged; `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is not equal to `inp[1]`, the program continues its execution without breaking.***
