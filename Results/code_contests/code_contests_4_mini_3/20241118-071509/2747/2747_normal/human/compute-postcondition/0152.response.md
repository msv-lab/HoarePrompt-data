Postcondition: ***`temp` contains one element which is the list `[order[i], order[0]]`, `lol` is either empty or contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, `count` is incremented by 1, and `same` remains unchanged. If either `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks, and if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, while `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists.**
