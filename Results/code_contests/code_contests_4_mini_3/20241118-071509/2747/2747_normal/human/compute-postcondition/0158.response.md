The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which changes its value from whatever it was previously to `[]`. The other variables `temp`, `count`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is [], `lol` is [], `count` remains unchanged, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is [], `lol` is [], `count` remains unchanged, and `same` remains unchanged**
