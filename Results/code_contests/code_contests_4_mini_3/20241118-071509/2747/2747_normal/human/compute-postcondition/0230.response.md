Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` contains one new list with elements [order[i], order[count]], and `lol` contains `order[i]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop is exited, indicating that the condition for breaking has been met. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop continues without any changes to the stated conditions.***
