According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count` and the length of `order`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `count` must be less than `len(order)` for the loop to execute again. Since `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `len(order)` is at least 1, meaning `len(order) - 1` is at least 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the only requirement is that `count` must be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. If `count` equals `len(order) - 1`, it will still allow one more iteration, but if `count` equals `len(order)`, the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `count` should be adjusted to be less than `len(order)`. Therefore, we could set `count` to `len(order) - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`order` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is `len(order) - 1`**
