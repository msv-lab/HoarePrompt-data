The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 2, so after execution, `count` becomes 3. The variable `c` is not defined in the initial state, but it is mentioned that it is increased by 1; however, its previous value is unknown and not directly affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 3, and `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is 3; `c` is increased by 1**
