Postcondition: ***`order` is a list with at least 1 element, if either `temp[0]` or `lol` is found in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are cleared, with `count` incremented by 1.***
