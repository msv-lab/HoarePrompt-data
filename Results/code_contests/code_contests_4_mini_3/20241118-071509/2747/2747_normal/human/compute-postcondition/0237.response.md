Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to len(order) - 1 then count` will be incremented by 1 after each iteration, `order` will maintain at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` and `lol` will be reset to empty lists after each iteration. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` will remain empty. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop will break, otherwise, `temp[0]` will be appended to `same`. If count starts at 0 and order has elements, the loop will execute at least once; if count is already greater than `len(order) - 1` before entering the loop, the loop won't execute and `count` will remain 0, `temp` and `lol` will be empty, and `same` will not change.**
