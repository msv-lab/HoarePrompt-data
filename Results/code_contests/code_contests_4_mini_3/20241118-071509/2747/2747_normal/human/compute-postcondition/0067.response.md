The value of `count` is incremented by 1, where its previous value is 1. After the execution, `count` becomes 2. The values of `c`, `i`, and `order` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `k + 1`, and `order` has been appended with `a[c]`.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `k + 1`, and `order` has been appended with `a[c]`**
