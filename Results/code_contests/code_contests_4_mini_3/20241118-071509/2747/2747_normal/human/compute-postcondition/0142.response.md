The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`temp`, `lol`, and `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1, and `same` remains unchanged**
