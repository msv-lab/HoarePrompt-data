The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` is 1, so after executing the code, `count` becomes 2. The values of `c` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 2, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `k + 1`.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `k + 1`**
