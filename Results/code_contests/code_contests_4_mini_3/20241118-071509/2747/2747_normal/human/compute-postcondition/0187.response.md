The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous values of `count` and `order` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, and `temp` is an empty list**
