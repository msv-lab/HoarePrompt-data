The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means `temp` no longer contains the previous value (which was `[order[i], order[0]]`). The states of the other variables (`count`, `order`, `lol`, and `same`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is now an empty list, `lol` contains [order[0], order[i]], and either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` has at least `len(order)` elements, `temp` is now an empty list, `lol` contains [order[0], order[i]], and either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`**
