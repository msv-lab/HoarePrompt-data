The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is 0, so after execution, `neg` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `numbers`, `num`, `num_zeros`, `needed_coins`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `num_zeros` is 1, `needed_coins` is 0, `neg` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `num_zeros` is 1, `needed_coins` is 0, `neg` is 1**
