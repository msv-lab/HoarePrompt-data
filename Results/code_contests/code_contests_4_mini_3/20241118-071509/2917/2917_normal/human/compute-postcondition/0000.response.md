The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, the output state reflects that `n` is now a specific positive integer based on the input provided. The list `numbers` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input; `numbers` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
