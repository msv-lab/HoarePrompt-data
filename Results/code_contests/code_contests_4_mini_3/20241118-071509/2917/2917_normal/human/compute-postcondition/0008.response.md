Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list. If `num` is less than 0, `neg` is incremented by 1. If `num` is greater than or equal to 0, `neg` remains unchanged at 0. The values of `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain as 0 in both cases.***
