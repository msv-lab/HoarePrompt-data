The code snippet increments the value of `num_zeros` by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but the only variable that changes is `num_zeros`. Other variables, such as `n`, `numbers`, `num`, and `neg`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `num_zeros` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `numbers` is a list of at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `neg` remains unchanged, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1**.
