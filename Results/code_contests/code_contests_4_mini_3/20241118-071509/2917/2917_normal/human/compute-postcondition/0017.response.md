The value of `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_zeros` is 1, so after execution, `num_zeros` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `num_zeros` is 2, `needed_coins` is 0, and `neg` is either 0 or 1 based on the value of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `num_zeros` is 2, `needed_coins` is 0, and `neg` is either 0 or 1 based on the value of `num`**
