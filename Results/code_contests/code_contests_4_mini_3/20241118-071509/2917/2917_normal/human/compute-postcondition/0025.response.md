Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `numbers` is a list of at least 3 integers, and `num` is the third integer in the list. If `num` is equal to 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1 without any change to `neg` or `needed_coins`. If `num` is less than 0, `neg` remains unchanged, and `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`. If `num` is positive, `neg` remains unchanged, and `needed_coins` is also increased by `abs(num) - 1`, which simplifies to `num - 1`. Thus, the function appropriately accounts for all values of `num` with respect to `num_zeros` and `needed_coins`.***
