The variable `num_zeros` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are: `n` is a positive integer based on input, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers converted from input, and `neg` is 0. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer based on input, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `neg` is 0, and `num_zeros` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `neg` is 0, and `num_zeros` is initialized to 0**
