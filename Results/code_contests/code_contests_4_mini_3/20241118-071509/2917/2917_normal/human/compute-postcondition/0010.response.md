`num_zeros` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `num_zeros` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is 0, `neg` is 0, and `num_zeros` is 1, while `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is 0, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 1, `needed_coins` is 0**
