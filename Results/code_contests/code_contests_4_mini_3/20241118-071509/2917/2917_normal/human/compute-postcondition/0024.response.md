The value of `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`. The value of `num` is the third integer in the list `numbers`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, we can assume that `num` is validly indexed. The specific value of `num` is not provided, but it is stated that if `num` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1. However, the code snippet does not affect `neg`.

The calculation for `needed_coins` will depend on the value of `num`:
- If `num` is negative, `needed_coins` will be increased by `abs(num) - 1`, which is a positive value since `abs(num)` will be greater than `0`.
- If `num` is `0` or positive, `needed_coins` will be increased by `abs(num) - 1`, which will either be `-1` (if `num` is `0`, resulting in no change) or a positive value (if `num` is positive).

Since we don't have the specific values for `needed_coins` or `num`, we can summarize the potential output state:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `numbers` is a list of at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`**
