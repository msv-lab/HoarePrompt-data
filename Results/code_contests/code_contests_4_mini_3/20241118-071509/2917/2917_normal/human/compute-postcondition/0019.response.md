Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. If `num` is zero, then `num_zeros` is increased to 2 while `needed_coins` remains 0, and `neg` remains either 0 or 1. If `num` is positive, `num_zeros` remains 1 and `needed_coins` is updated by adding `abs(num) - 1` to its current value. If `num` is negative, `neg` would already be set to 1 based on the precondition. Thus, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` are updated only depending on the value of `num` while `neg` remains consistent with its initial state.***
