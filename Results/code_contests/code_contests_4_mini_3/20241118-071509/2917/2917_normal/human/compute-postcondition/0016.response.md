Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `num_zeros` is 1, and `needed_coins` is 0. If `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1, resulting in `neg` being equal to 1. If `num` is zero or positive, `neg` remains 0.***
