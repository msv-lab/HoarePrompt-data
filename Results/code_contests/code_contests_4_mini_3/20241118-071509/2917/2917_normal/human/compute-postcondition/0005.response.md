According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If the list contains at least 1 integer (since `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` must contain `n` integers), the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `num` will represent the first element of the list `numbers`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `numbers` must contain at least 1 integer, and `num` will be the first integer in the list. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0**
