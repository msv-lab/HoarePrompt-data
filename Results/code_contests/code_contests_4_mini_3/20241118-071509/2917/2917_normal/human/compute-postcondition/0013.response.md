Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, and `num` is the first integer in the list. If `num` is 0, then `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, resulting in `num_zeros` being 1, while `needed_coins` remains 0. If `num` is not 0, then `num_zeros` is 0 and `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`. In either case, `neg` remains unchanged at 0.***
