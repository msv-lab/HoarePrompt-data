Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the total amount calculated as the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. `neg` is an even number. If `numbers` is an empty list, then `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` are all 0.***
