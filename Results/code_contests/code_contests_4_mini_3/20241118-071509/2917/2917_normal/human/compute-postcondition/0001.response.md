The variable `numbers` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input as a string, splits it into individual components, and converts each component into an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, which means `raw_input()` will accept `n` integers as input. The state of `n` remains unchanged, but `numbers` now holds a list of `n` integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `numbers` while maintaining the initial value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input; `numbers` is a list of `n` integers converted from input.**
