The value of `needed_coins` is incremented by `abs(num) - 1`. Since `num` is the first integer in the list and is not equal to 0, `abs(num)` will yield a positive integer value. Therefore, the value of `needed_coins` will increase by this positive integer minus 1. The variables `n`, `numbers`, `num`, and `neg` remain unchanged, and `num_zeros` remains 0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `num` is not equal to 0, `neg` remains unchanged at 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`.**
