The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is 0, so after execution, `neg` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list which is less than 0, `neg` is 1, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list which is less than 0, `neg` is 1, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0**
