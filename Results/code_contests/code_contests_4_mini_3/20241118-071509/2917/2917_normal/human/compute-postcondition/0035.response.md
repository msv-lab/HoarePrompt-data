The value of `needed_coins` is incremented by `num_zeros`. Since `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, the new value of `needed_coins` will be the previous value plus the count of zeros. The values of `neg` and `num_zeros` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is updated to its previous value plus `num_zeros`.

Output State: **`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is updated to its previous value plus `num_zeros`**.
