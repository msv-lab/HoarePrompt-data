Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the total amount calculated as the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. If `neg` is an odd count, and `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`. If `neg` is odd and `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is increased by 2. If `neg` is even, `needed_coins` is updated to its previous value plus `num_zeros`. In the case where `numbers` is empty, `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0.***
