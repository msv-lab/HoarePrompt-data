The variable `needed_coins` is initialized to 0. The initial states of other variables remain unchanged and unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer based on input, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0, and `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input, `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0, and `needed_coins` is 0**
