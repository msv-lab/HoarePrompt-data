The `needed_coins` is incremented by `num_zeros`. Given that `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` will increase, but the specific value of `num_zeros` is not provided, so we cannot quantify the exact new value of `needed_coins`. The counts of negative integers and zeros remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `needed_coins`.

Output State: **`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`**
