The function accepts an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. It counts the number of negative integers, zeros, and calculates the total needed coins based on the absolute values of positive integers. If the count of negative integers is odd and there are no zeros, it adds 2 to the needed coins; if there are zeros, it adds the count of zeros. If the count of negative integers is even, it simply adds the count of zeros to the needed coins. Finally, it prints the total needed coins. Edge cases include handling an empty input list where all counts remain zero, and it assumes valid input without handling potential exceptions from input conversion.
