The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000, `n` will now hold the input integer value from the user. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)**
