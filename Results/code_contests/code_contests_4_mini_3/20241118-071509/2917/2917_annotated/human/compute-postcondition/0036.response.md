Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all non-zero integers in `numbers`. If `neg` is an odd positive integer, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros` if `num_zeros` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is increased by 2. If `neg` is an even count of negative integers, `needed_coins` is incremented by `num_zeros`. In the case where `numbers` is empty, all values remain zero. Thus, `needed_coins` is adjusted based on the parity of `neg` and the count of zeros in `numbers`.***
