The variable `needed_coins` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `numbers`, `neg`, and `num_zeros` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0, and `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0, and `needed_coins` is 0**
