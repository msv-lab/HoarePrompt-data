Postcondition: ***`neg` is an odd positive integer. If `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`. If `num_zeros` is equal to 0, `needed_coins` is increased by 2. Thus, `needed_coins` is adjusted based on the count of zeros in `numbers`, ensuring it is always incremented appropriately based on the presence or absence of zeros.***
