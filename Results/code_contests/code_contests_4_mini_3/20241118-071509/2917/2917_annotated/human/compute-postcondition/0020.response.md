According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` object. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a map object with at least 1 integer remaining, and `num` is the second integer in `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 1 more integer remaining in the `numbers` object after the current iteration.

Since `num` is the second integer, for the loop to continue, `numbers` should now have at least 3 integers remaining (the first integer and one more after the second). Additionally, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer in the `numbers` object, which would be the third integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 3 integers remaining, `num` is the third integer in `numbers`.**
