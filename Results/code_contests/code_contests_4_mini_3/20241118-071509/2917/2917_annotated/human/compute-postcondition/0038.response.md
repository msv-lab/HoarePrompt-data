The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `numbers`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000. The parameter `numbers` is a list of integers, where each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies the condition of being between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000. 

The function does not return any specific value in the provided output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `numbers` without specifying a return value or behavior based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `numbers`.**
