Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer remaining, and `num` is the second integer in `numbers`. If `num` is zero, `num_zeros` is increased by 1 and `neg` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`, and `neg` remains unchanged.***
