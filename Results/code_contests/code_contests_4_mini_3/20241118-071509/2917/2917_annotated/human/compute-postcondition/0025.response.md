Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 3 integers remaining, and `num` is the third integer in `numbers`. If `num` is equal to 0, then `num_zeros` is increased by 1. If `num` is greater than 0, then `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`. If `num` is less than 0, the variable `neg` remains unchanged as the condition does not affect the outcome of `num_zeros` or `needed_coins`.***
