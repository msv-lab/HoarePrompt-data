The variable `needed_coins` is increased by the value of `abs(num) - 1`. The value of `num` is taken from the `numbers` map object. The absolute value of `num` is calculated, and then 1 is subtracted from it. The state of `neg` remains unchanged since we are not modifying it in this code snippet.

The value of `needed_coins` is affected based on the current value of `num`, but we don't have the specific value of `num` defined. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `needed_coins` without specifying its exact value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer remaining, `num` is the second integer in `numbers`; `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`**
