The value of `neg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `neg` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `neg` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `numbers` and is less than 0, `neg` is 1, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0, and `needed_coins` is 0**
