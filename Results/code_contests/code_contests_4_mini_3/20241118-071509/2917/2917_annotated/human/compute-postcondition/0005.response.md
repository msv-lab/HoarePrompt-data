According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` object. Since `numbers` is a map object, it needs to contain at least one integer for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is a positive integer, we assume that `numbers` is derived from a collection of integers of size `n`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, the following adjustments are needed:
- `numbers` must contain at least one integer.
- `num` should be initialized to the first value in `numbers`.

Therefore, the state needs to include that `numbers` contains at least one integer, and `num` must be the first element from that map object.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in numbers, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0, and `needed_coins` is 0**
