The code assigns `numbers` the result of the `map(int, raw_input().split())` function. This means that it will take a line of input, split it into separate string elements, convert each of these string elements to an integer, and return a map object containing these integers. The initial state of `n` is not directly affected, but the output state will reflect that `numbers` is now an iterable map object of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from input**
