According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` map object. Since `numbers` has at least 3 integers remaining at the end of the last iteration and `num` is the third integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least 4 integers left. Additionally, after the current iteration, `num` will change to the fourth integer in the `numbers` map object.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 4 integers remaining, and `num` is the fourth integer in `numbers`.**
