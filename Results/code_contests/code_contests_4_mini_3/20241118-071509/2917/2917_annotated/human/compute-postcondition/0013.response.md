Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in `numbers`. If `num` is 0, then `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, `neg` remains unchanged, and `needed_coins` is 0. If `num` is a positive integer, then `num_zeros` remains 0, and `needed_coins` is updated to `abs(num) - 1`. If `num` is a negative integer (which contradicts the precondition but can be an edge case), `neg` is increased by 1, `num_zeros` remains 0, and `needed_coins` is updated to `abs(num) - 1`.***
