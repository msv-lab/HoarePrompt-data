The statement `needed_coins += num_zeros` increments the value of `needed_coins` by the value of `num_zeros`. Since `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` will increase. The values of `neg` and the other variables are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `needed_coins` while maintaining the current states of `neg` and `num_zeros`.

Output State: **`neg` is an odd positive integer, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`, and `num_zeros` is greater than 0**
