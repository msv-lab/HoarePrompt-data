The variable `num_zeros` is initialized to 0. The initial values of `n`, `numbers`, and `neg` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from input, `neg` is 0, and `num_zeros` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0**
