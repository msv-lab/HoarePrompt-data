The variable `neg` is initialized to `0`. Since there are no other variables affected and `neg` is simply being set to `0`, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from input, and `neg` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from input, and `neg` is 0**
