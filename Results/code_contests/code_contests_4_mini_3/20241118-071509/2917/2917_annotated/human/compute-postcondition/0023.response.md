The code `num_zeros += 1` increments the value of `num_zeros` by 1. The previous value of `num_zeros` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a non-negative integer. The values of `n`, `numbers`, and `num` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 3 integers remaining, `num` is the third integer in `numbers`, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 3 integers remaining, `num` is the third integer in `numbers`, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1.**
