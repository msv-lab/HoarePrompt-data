Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in `numbers`. If `num` is less than 0, then `neg` is increased by 1. If `num` is 0 or greater, `neg` remains unchanged. In both cases, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0, and `needed_coins` is 0.***
