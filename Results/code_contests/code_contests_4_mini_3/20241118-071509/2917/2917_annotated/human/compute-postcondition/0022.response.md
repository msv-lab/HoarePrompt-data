Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 3 integers remaining, and `num` is the third integer in `numbers`. If `num` is less than 0, the variable `neg` is increased by 1. If `num` is 0 or greater, the value of `neg` remains unchanged.***
