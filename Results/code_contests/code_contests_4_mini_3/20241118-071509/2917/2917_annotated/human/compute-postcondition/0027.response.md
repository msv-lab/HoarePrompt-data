Output State: **`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, `needed_coins` is the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all non-zero integers in `numbers`. If `numbers` is empty, the loop does not execute and `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` all remain 0. If `numbers` contains at least one integer, the loop will execute for each integer, updating the respective counts and sums based on the integer values.**
