The value of `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `num_zeros` is 0, so after execution, `num_zeros` will be 1. The states of the other variables, including `n`, `numbers`, `num`, `neg`, and `needed_coins`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is 0, `neg` remains unchanged, `num_zeros` is 1, and `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is 0, `neg` remains unchanged, `num_zeros` is 1, and `needed_coins` is 0**.
