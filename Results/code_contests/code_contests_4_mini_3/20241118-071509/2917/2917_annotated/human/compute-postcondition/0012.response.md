The expression `needed_coins += abs(num) - 1` calculates the new value of `needed_coins`. Since `num` is a negative integer, `abs(num)` will yield a positive integer equal to the absolute value of `num`. This means `abs(num) - 1` will be a positive integer that is one less than the absolute value of `num`. The previous value of `needed_coins` is 0, so its new value will be `abs(num) - 1`.

Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state reflects the updated value of `needed_coins` based on the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is a negative integer, `neg` is increased by 1, `num_zeros` is initialized to 0, and `needed_coins` is updated to `abs(num) - 1`**.
