The value of `needed_coins` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `needed_coins` is based on the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all non-zero integers in `numbers`, which is unknown, but it is affected by the addition of 2. The values of `neg` and `num_zeros` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `neg` is an odd positive integer, `num_zeros` is equal to 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`neg` is an odd positive integer, `num_zeros` is equal to 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by 2**
