Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and calculates the number of needed coins based on the counts of negative integers and zeros in the list. It returns the total needed coins, which is calculated by summing the absolute values of the non-zero integers minus one, adjusting for the presence of negative integers and zeros. Specifically, if there is an odd count of negative integers, it adds either the number of zeros or 2 to the needed coins, while if the count of negative integers is even, it simply adds the number of zeros. If the input list is empty, it returns 0 as needed coins. **
