According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop iterates from `start` to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `start + 1`, which means that `i` is currently one more than `start`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `end`.

Currently, `start` is less than `end`, and `i` equals `start + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` must be greater than `start + 1`, meaning that `end` must be adjusted to be greater than `start + 1`. Additionally, `i` should be incremented to `start + 2` for the next iteration.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists with bomb's coordinates at `surface[y][x]` changed to 0, `x` is an integer within the range 1 to 8, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is greater than `start + 1`, and `i` is `start + 2`.**
