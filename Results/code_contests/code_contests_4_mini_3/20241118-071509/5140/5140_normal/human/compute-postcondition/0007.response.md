According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `start`, and since `start` is less than `end`, `i` can take on the value of `start` in the next iteration.

To determine the next state:
- Since `i` is currently `start`, it will increment to `start + 1` for the next iteration.
- We need to ensure that `i` (which will be `start + 1`) is still less than `end` for the loop to execute again.

Currently, since `start` is less than `end`, adjusting `i` to `start + 1` means it will be within the range for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `i` will be `start + 1` in the next iteration.
- Since `surface[y][i]` could possibly be a non-zero value, that condition remains unchanged as it's dependent on the state of `surface`.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists with bomb's coordinates at `surface[y][x]` changed to 0, `x` is an integer within the range 1 to 8, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is adjusted accordingly, and `i` is `start + 1`**
