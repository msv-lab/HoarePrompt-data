Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 lists with bomb's coordinates at `surface[y][x]` changed to 0, `x` is an integer within the range 1 to 8, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is adjusted accordingly, and `i` is `start + 1`. If `surface[y][i]` is non-zero (indicating the presence of a bomb), the function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If `surface[y][i]` is zero, no action is taken.***
