To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables `start`, `end`, and `i`.

1. The variable `start` is defined as `y - 3` if `y - 3` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is set to 0. This means that `start` can either be a positive number or 0, depending on the value of `y`. For the loop to execute, `start` must be less than `end`.

2. The variable `end` is defined as `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8; otherwise, it is set to 8. This means `end` could either be `y + 4` (which can be less than 8) or 8. 

3. For the loop to execute, the range defined by `start` and `end` must have at least one valid integer. This requires that `start` is less than `end`.

Now, let's analyze the scenarios:

- If `y - 3 > 0`, then `start = y - 3`, which is a positive integer.
- If `y + 4 < 8`, then `end = y + 4`.
- The loop will execute if `start < end`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states such that:

- `y` must be greater than 3 to ensure that `start` is positive.
- If `y` is less than or equal to 3, then `start` will be 0.
- If `y` is greater than or equal to 4, then `end` will be `y + 4`, which must be greater than `start`.

Thus, we can summarize the necessary conditions:

- If `y` is greater than 3, `start` is `y - 3`, and `end` is `y + 4` (assuming `y + 4 < 8`).
- If `y` is less than or equal to 3, `start` is 0, and `end` is 8 (since `y + 4` will be less than 8).

So, we can conclude:

State: **`start` is 0 if `y <= 3`, or `start` is `y - 3` if `y > 3`; `end` is `y + 4` if `y + 4 < 8`, otherwise `end` is 8; `i` starts at `start`.**
