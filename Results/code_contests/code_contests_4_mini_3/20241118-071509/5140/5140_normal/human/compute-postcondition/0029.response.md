The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `surface` is a list of 8 lists, with each inner list containing 8 integers (either 0 or 1), representing the state of the plane. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers that represent the coordinates of the bomb that explodes first, constrained such that 1 <= x <= 8 and 1 <= y <= 8. The function processes these inputs and returns a certain output based on the state of the plane and the bomb coordinates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists `surface` representing the state of the plane and two integers `x` and `y` representing the coordinates of the first bomb. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the bomb's explosion and the state of the plane.**
