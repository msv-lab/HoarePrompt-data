The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. However, the values of `surface` and `x` are not specified in the initial state, and the execution of `func_1` does not alter the values of `start`, `end`, or `i` in the provided context. Therefore, the output state focuses on the fact that the function is invoked without changing any previously defined variables.

Output State: **`start` is 0 if `y <= 3`, or `start` is `y - 3` if `y > 3`; `end` is 8; `i` is 8, and `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called.**
