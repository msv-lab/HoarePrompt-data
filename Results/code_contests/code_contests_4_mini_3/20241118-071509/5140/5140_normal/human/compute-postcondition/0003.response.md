According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop will execute if `start` is less than `end`. 

Given that:
- `start` is 0 when `x` is 1, 2, or 3, and in that case, `end` will be either 5, 6, or 7, ensuring the loop will execute since 0 < 5 (or 6, or 7).
- When `x` is between 4 and 8, `start` will be between 1 and 5, and `end` will be 8, ensuring the loop will execute as well since any value of `start` in that range will be less than 8.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes:
1. The value of `start` must be less than `end`, which is already ensured by the conditions given.
2. The value of `i` should be initialized to `start` when the loop begins.

No specific adjustments to variables other than `i` are necessary since the conditions for `start` and `end` already ensure the loop execution. 

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists with bomb's coordinates at `surface[y][x]` changed to 0, `x` is an integer within the range 1 to 8, `start` is adjusted to be less than `end`, `end` is adjusted accordingly, `i` is `start`**
