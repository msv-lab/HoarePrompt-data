Postcondition: ***`start` is 0 if `y <= 3`, or `start` is `y - 3` if `y > 3`; `end` is `y + 4` if `y + 4 < 8`, otherwise `end` is 8; `i` starts at `start` and if the value at `surface[i][x]` is true, then the function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called. If `surface[i][x]` is false, no action is taken.***
