The execution of `func_1(surface, x, i)` does not change the values of any of the variables directly since it is a function call, and we do not have information about what `func_1` does. The values of `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables.

Output State: **`start` is 0 if `y <= 3`, or `start` is `y - 3` if `y > 3`; `end` is 8; `i` is 7**
