Output State: **`surface` remains a list of 8 lists with bomb's coordinates at `surface[y][x]` changed to 0, `x` is an integer within the range 1 to 8, `start` is less than `end` if the loop executes; `end` is adjusted accordingly. The variable `i` takes values from `start` to `end - 1`. If `start` is equal to or greater than `end`, the loop does not execute, leaving `surface` unchanged. If `surface[y][i]` is non-zero, then `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called, indicating the bomb's coordinates at that position have been processed; if `surface[y][i]` is zero, no action is taken.**
