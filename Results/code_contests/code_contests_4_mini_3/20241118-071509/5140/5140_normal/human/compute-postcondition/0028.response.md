Output State: **`start` is 0 if `y <= 3`, or `start` is `y - 3` if `y > 3`; `end` is `y + 4` if `y + 4 < 8`, otherwise `end` is 8; `i` will take values from `start` to `end - 1`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop will not execute, resulting in no changes to the state of the program. If the loop executes, for each value of `i`, if `surface[i][x]` is true, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called; if false, there are no changes to the program state. If `start` is 0 or less and `end` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.**
