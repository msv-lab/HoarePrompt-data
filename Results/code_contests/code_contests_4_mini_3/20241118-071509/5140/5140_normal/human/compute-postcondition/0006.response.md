Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 lists with bomb's coordinates at `surface[y][x]` changed to 0, `x` is an integer within the range 1 to 8, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is adjusted accordingly, and `i` is `start`. If `surface[y][i]` is a non-zero value, the function `func_1` is executed with parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y`, indicating that the bomb's coordinates at that position have been processed; otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
