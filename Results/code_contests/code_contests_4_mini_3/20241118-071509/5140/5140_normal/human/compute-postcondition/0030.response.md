Functionality: ** The function accepts a two-dimensional list `surface` representing a grid of bomb coordinates and two integers `x` and `y` that denote the position of the first bomb. It sets the value at `surface[y][x]` to 0, indicating the bomb has exploded, and then recursively processes adjacent bomb coordinates horizontally and vertically within a range of 3 units in either direction, changing their values to 0 as well. The function does not return any value; it modifies the `surface` in place. **
