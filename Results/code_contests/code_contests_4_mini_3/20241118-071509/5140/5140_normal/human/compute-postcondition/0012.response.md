Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 lists with bomb's coordinates at `surface[y][x]` changed to 0, `x` is an integer within the range 1 to 8, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is greater than `start + 1`, and `i` is `start + 2`. If `surface[y][i]` is non-zero (indicating the presence of a bomb), then the function `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called, which may modify the state of `surface`. If `surface[y][i]` is zero, no action is taken, and the state of `surface` remains unchanged.***
