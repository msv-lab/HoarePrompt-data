To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop conditions and the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `start` to `end`. 
   - `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`.
   - `end` is an integer greater than `i`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current index being processed in the loop.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `end`.

3. **Adjusting for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `end`. Therefore, `end` must remain greater than the new value of `i` after incrementing it for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, it is required that `end` remains greater than `i + 1`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The current state of `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` to reflect the next iteration.
   - `end` must remain greater than `i + 1`, which means that it can stay the same if it was already greater than the current value of `i + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state will reflect that `i` has incremented by 1, while ensuring that `end` is still greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, and `end` is an integer such that `end` is greater than `i + 1`.**
