Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, and `end` is an integer such that `end` is greater than `i`. If `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true, the function `func_1` is called with `surface`, `x`, and `i` as arguments. If `surface[i][x]` is false, no action is taken. The state of the variables remains unchanged after the if statement unless `func_1` modifies them within its execution.***
