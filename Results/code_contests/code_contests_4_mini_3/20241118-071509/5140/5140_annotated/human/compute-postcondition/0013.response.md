According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop iterates over the range from `start` to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `start`, and since `end` is greater than `start + 1`, it indicates that there are more values in the range to iterate over.

Since `surface[y][x]` is '0' and `surface[y][i]` evaluates to True, we need to increment `i` for the next iteration. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be `start + 1`, and since `end` is greater than `start + 1`, it remains valid for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `surface[y][x]` is '0', `start` is equal to `end - 1`, `end` is greater than `start + 1`, `i` is `start + 1`**
