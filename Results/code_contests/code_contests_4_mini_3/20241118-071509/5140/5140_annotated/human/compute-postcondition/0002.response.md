The variable `end` is assigned the value `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8; otherwise, it is assigned the value 8. Given that `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, we can determine the possible values for `end`.

- If `x` is 1, then `end = 1 + 4 = 5`.
- If `x` is 2, then `end = 2 + 4 = 6`.
- If `x` is 3, then `end = 3 + 4 = 7`.
- If `x` is 4, then `end = 4 + 4 = 8`.
- If `x` is 5, then `end = 5 + 4 = 9`, which is not less than 8, so `end = 8`.
- If `x` is 6, then `end = 6 + 4 = 10`, which is not less than 8, so `end = 8`.
- If `x` is 7, then `end = 7 + 4 = 11`, which is not less than 8, so `end = 8`.
- If `x` is 8, then `end = 8 + 4 = 12`, which is not less than 8, so `end = 8`.

Thus, the possible values for `end` based on the value of `x` would be:

- `end` is either 5, 6, 7, or 8.

The values of `surface`, `y`, and `start` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `surface[y][x]` is '0', `start` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and `end` is either 5, 6, 7, or 8.**
