Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, and `end` is an integer such that `end` is greater than `i + 1`. If `surface[i][x]` evaluates to True, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called. If `surface[i][x]` evaluates to False, there are no changes to the state of the program.***
