Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, `end` is an integer such that `end` is greater than `start`. If the string at index `i` in `surface` at position `x` is not empty or evaluates to true, the function `func_1` is called with `surface`, `x`, and `i` as parameters. If the string is empty or evaluates to false, no action is taken. All precondition constraints are maintained throughout the execution.***
