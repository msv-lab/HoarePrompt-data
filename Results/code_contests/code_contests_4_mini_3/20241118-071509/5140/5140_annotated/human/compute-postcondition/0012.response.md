Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `surface[y][x]` is '0', `start` is equal to `end - 1`, `end` is greater than `start + 1`, `i` is `start`, and `end` is greater than `start + 1`. If `surface[y][i]` evaluates to True (non-zero or non-empty), then the function `func_1` is executed with parameters `(surface, i, y)`. If `surface[y][i]` evaluates to False (zero or empty), no action is taken.***
