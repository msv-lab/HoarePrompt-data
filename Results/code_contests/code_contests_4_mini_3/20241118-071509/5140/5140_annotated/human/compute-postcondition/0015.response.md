The value of `start` is assigned based on the condition `y - 3`. If `y` is greater than 3, `start` will be `y - 3`; otherwise, it will be `0`. The values of `surface` and the range for `end` are not changed by this assignment. The output state reflects the possible values for `start` depending on the value of `y`.

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `start` is either `y - 3` (if `y > 3`) or `0` (if `y <= 3`)**
