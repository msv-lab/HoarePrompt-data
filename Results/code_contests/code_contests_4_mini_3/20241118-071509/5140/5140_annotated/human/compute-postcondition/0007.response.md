According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop iterates with `i` starting from `start` and going up to, but not including, `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is less than `end`, which means the loop has executed at least once and `i` would have been equal to `start` during that execution.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, meaning it would go up to `start + 1`. The loop must ensure that `i` remains less than `end`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `start` must be increased to be equal to `end - 1`, and `end` needs to remain greater than `start`.

Since `i` is currently at `start`, it will be incremented to `start + 1`, so we need to ensure that `end` remains greater than `start + 1`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `surface[y][x]` is '0', `start` is equal to `end - 1`, `end` is greater than `start + 1`**
