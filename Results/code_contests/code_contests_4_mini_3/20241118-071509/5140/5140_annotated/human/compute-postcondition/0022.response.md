The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The initial state does not provide specific values for these variables, but we know their constraints and relationships.

- `surface` is a list of 8 strings, which may contain any string values.
- `x` is an integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.
- `y` is an integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.
- `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, which means it can take the values from `-2` to `5` depending on the value of `y`.
- `end` is an integer that is greater than `i`, where the current value of `i` is `end - 1`, indicating that `i` can be derived from `end`.

Since `func_1` is a function call, it may perform operations on the input arguments but does not modify the state of the input variables outside its scope. Therefore, the final output state will reflect that the function was called with the specified arguments.

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings; `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8; `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8; `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`; `end` is an integer such that `end` is greater than `i`; and the function `func_1` is called with these arguments.**
