To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the variables involved in the loop.

1. The loop runs from `start` to `end`, meaning that the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `end`.
2. The variable `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, and `end` is greater than `start`. This indicates that the range of `i` starts at `start` and goes up to but does not include `end`.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is currently at `end - 1` (the last valid index the loop can reach). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment by one, meaning we need to adjust `end` to be greater than the current `i`, which is `end - 1`.

Thus, we don't need to modify `start`, but we need to increase `end` to allow `i` to continue iterating. Consequently, we need `end` to be at least one greater than the current value of `i`.

Given that `i` is currently less than `end`, to allow for one more iteration, `end` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, `end` is an integer such that `end` is greater than `i` (current value of `i` is `end - 1`)**
