According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `start` and `end`. For the loop to execute, `start` must be less than `end`. Given the constraints provided, `start` can take values from 0 to 5 and `end` can take values from 5 to 8. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we must have a situation where `start` is less than `end`. This means that the value of `end` should be at least 1 greater than `start`.

Additionally, the loop variable `i` will start from `start` and increment up to `end - 1`. Therefore, if `start` is 5, `end` should be at least 6 for the loop to execute, and similar logic applies for other values.

Given this information, we can summarize the necessary states:

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `surface[y][x]` is '0', `start` is less than `end`, `end` is greater than `start`**
