Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `surface[y][x]` is '0', `start` is less than `end`, `end` is greater than `start`. If `surface[y][i]` is truthy, the function `func_1(surface, i, y)` is executed. If `surface[y][i]` is falsy, no action is taken regarding `func_1`.***
