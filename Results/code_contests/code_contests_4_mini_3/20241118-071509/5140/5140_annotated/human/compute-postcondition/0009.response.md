Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `surface[y][x]` is '0', `start` is equal to `end - 1`, and `end` is greater than `start + 1`. If `surface[y][i]` is truthy (non-empty string or non-zero value), the function `func_1` is called with the arguments `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If `surface[y][i]` is falsy (empty string or zero), no changes occur and `func_1` is not called.***
