Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of 8 strings (each representing a row of 8 characters, either '0' or '1'), and two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 7 inclusive). It sets the value at `surface[y][x]` to 0 and then recursively checks horizontally and vertically in the `surface` for adjacent non-zero values. For each non-zero value found, it calls itself with the coordinates of that value. The function does not have a return statement, indicating it does not return a value to the caller. **
