According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop iterates from `start` to `end - 1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to `end - 1`, which means `i` is currently `start` (which is equal to `end - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `end` must be increased to allow `i` to take on the value of `end`, which would be one more than the previous iteration.

Since we know that `end` is greater than `start + 1`, we can safely adjust `end` to be greater than `start + 1` in such a way that the condition still holds true. Additionally, `i` would need to be set to `start`, which is currently `end - 1`.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `surface[y][x]` is '0', `start` is equal to `end - 1`, and `end` is greater than `start + 1`, `i` is `start`, and `end` is greater than `start + 1`**
