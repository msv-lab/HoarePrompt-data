The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `surface` is a list that contains 8 strings, each of which consists of 8 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers constrained by the conditions that 1 <= x <= 8 and 1 <= y <= 8. 

Based on the output, the function processes the `surface` based on the coordinates `(x, y)`. The specific return values have not been detailed, but the function likely evaluates the value at the position defined by these coordinates in the `surface` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of 8 strings (each containing 8 characters '0' or '1') as `surface`, and two integers `x` and `y` (both between 1 and 8 inclusive). It likely returns a value based on the evaluation of the `surface` at the coordinates specified by `x` and `y`.**
