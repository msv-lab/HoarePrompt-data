Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `start` is either `y - 3` (if `y > 3`) or `0` (if `y <= 3), `end` is an integer such that `end` is greater than `start` and less than or equal to 8. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to `surface`. If the loop executes, for each `i` from `start` to `end - 1`, if `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true, the function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called; otherwise, no action is taken. The state of `surface`, `x`, `y`, `start`, and `end` remains unchanged after the loop unless modified by `func_1`.**
