Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 8, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= `y` <= 8, `start` is less than `end`, and `end` is greater than `start`. The loop executes for every `i` in the range from `start` to `end - 1`. If `surface[y][i]` evaluates to True (non-zero or non-empty), the function `func_1(surface, i, y)` is executed. If `surface[y][i]` evaluates to False (zero or empty), no action is taken regarding `func_1`. If `start` is equal to `end`, the loop does not execute, and no changes occur to `surface`. If `surface[y][i]` is always falsy for all indices in the range, the function `func_1` will not be called during any iteration.**
