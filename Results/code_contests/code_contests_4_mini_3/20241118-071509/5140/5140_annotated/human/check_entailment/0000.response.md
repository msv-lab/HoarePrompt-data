To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations given.

### Program Logic:
The function `func_1(surface, x, y)` is designed to simulate the explosion of bombs on a grid. The main steps are:

1. The bomb at position `(x, y)` is set to 0 (indicating it has exploded).
2. The function calculates the range of indices to check in the horizontal direction:
   - `start` is calculated as `x - 3` (or 0 if less than 0).
   - `end` is calculated as `x + 4` (or 8 if greater than 8).
3. It then checks each position in this range:
   - If there is a bomb (`surface[y][i]` is true), it recursively calls itself to handle the explosion of that bomb.
4. The same logic applies vertically:
   - The function checks positions above and below the bomb, and again calls itself for any bombs found.

### Key Observations:
- The program explodes bombs in both horizontal and vertical directions recursively.
- The program uses 0-based indexing (as seen in the code), but the input coordinates (X, Y) provided in the problem description are 1-based. This discrepancy needs to be considered during testing.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Input Bounds**:
   - If a bomb is placed at the edge of the grid (for example, coordinates (1,1) or (8,8)), the program should handle these boundaries correctly. The bounds checking in the code seems to be set up to do this.

2. **Recursive Explosion**:
   - If there are multiple bombs in line with the first bomb that explodes, the program should continue to chain-reaction until no more bombs are left. This seems to be handled correctly by the recursive calls.

3. **Single Bomb**:
   - If there is only one bomb on the grid and it is the one set to explode, the output should correctly show that bomb as exploded.

4. **No Bombs**:
   - If there are no bombs at all on the grid and a position is given, the output should remain all zeros.

5. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The code does not check if the input coordinates are valid, i.e., within the range of the grid. If coordinates are out of bounds (for instance, (0,0) or (9,9)), it could lead to index errors.

### Conclusion:
While the program handles explosions correctly in most cases, it lacks input validation for the coordinates provided. If the coordinates are outside the grid (0-based index), this could lead to an error or unexpected behavior.

Since we found a potential case where the program might not handle out-of-bounds coordinates correctly, we conclude that the program is not completely robust.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not consider invalid input coordinates, which may lead to runtime errors or incorrect behavior.
