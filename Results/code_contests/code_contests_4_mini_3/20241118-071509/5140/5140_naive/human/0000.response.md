To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, I will analyze both the problem requirements and the provided code.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- The input consists of multiple datasets where each dataset contains an 8x8 grid representing the presence of bombs (`1`) and non-bombs (`0`).
- A bomb explosion affects the three squares in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the bomb.
- When a bomb explodes, it can cause other bombs in the affected squares to explode, leading to a chain reaction.
- The output should reflect the final state of the grid after all possible explosions have occurred.

**Provided Program Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1` is intended to simulate the explosion of bombs.
2. It modifies the `surface` grid based on the bomb's explosion and recursively triggers the explosion for adjacent bombs.
3. The `surface` grid is modified in place, and the results are printed for each dataset.

**Key Points to Consider:**
- The explosion affects squares both horizontally and vertically.
- The program checks for boundaries when determining which bombs to trigger in the explosion.
- The coordinates for the bomb explosion are adjusted by subtracting one to convert from 1-based to 0-based indices.

**Potential Issues:**
1. In the `func_1` function, the explosion affects are calculated using the conditions:
   - `start = x - 3 if x - 3 > 0 else 0`
   - `end = x + 4 if x + 4 < 8 else 8`
   - This means that if a bomb is located at the edge of the grid, it may not properly affect all intended squares.
   - Specifically, if a bomb is at (1, 1), the explosion would not correctly propagate to the left or above since it would only check from (0, 0) to (0, 4) and (1, 0) to (4, 1), missing the boundary conditions.
  
2. The program does not account for the case when two bombs are positioned right next to each other. If one triggers, it should subsequently trigger the other but the way the explosion logic is structured may lead to missed triggers.

**Example Case to Illustrate the Issue:**
- Consider the following grid:
```
11110000
11110000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
```
- If the bomb at (1, 1) (which is `(0, 0)` in 0-based indexing) explodes, it will trigger several bombs. However, due to the way the bounds are checked, the bombs at (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2) may not trigger correctly if they are at the edge of the explosion spread logic.

**Conclusion:**
The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly the explosion propagation logic when bombs are located at the edges of the grid. Thus, it is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
