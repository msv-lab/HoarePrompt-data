To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's evaluate the code step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Input Format:**
   - The program reads the number of datasets, followed by 8 lines representing the bomb placement.
   - Each bomb is represented by '1' and empty squares by '0'.
   - The coordinates of the bomb that will explode first are given (X, Y).

2. **Functionality of the Program:**
   - The function `func_1(surface, x, y)` is intended to handle the explosion and chain reactions:
     - It marks the current bomb's position as exploded by setting `surface[y][x] = 0`.
     - It then checks for other bombs in the same row and column that need to explode as a result of the chain reaction.

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses `x - 3` and `x + 4` for horizontal and `y - 3` and `y + 4` for vertical explosions. This means it checks 4 squares in each direction from the bomb that exploded.
   - However, the explosion chain should only affect the immediate adjacent squares (up, down, left, right), which would be `x-1`, `x+1`, `y-1`, and `y+1`. The program incorrectly expands the explosion range to 3 squares in each direction, which is not what the problem specifies.

4. **Example to Illustrate the Issue:**
   - Consider a case where bombs are placed as follows:
     ```
     00010000
     00000000
     00000000
     00000000
     00000000
     00000000
     00000000
     00000000
     ```
   - If the bomb at (1, 5) (zero-based indexing, which corresponds to (2, 6) in the problem's one-based indexing) explodes, it should only affect:
     - (1, 4) and (1, 6) (horizontal)
     - (0, 5) and (2, 5) (vertical)
   - However, due to the current logic in the program, it would incorrectly mark additional squares beyond the immediate vicinity, causing unexpected behavior.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the explosion logic as described in the problem statement. Thus, there are cases where its output would not match the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
