Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is compared to the value popped from the left of `t` using `popleft()`. If the comparison `i < t.popleft()` is true, then `poss` is updated to 1, otherwise, it remains 0. The states of `t`, `m`, and `arr` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has one less element, `m` remains the same, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result, and `arr` still has elements remaining.
Output State: **`t` has one less element, `m` remains the same, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result, and `arr` still has elements remaining**
