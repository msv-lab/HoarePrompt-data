Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared to the leftmost element of `t`, and if `i` is less than that element, `poss` remains true. The leftmost element of `t` is removed after the comparison. The state of `m`, `arr`, and other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has one less element, `m` remains the same, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result, and `arr` is not affected.
Output State: **`t` has one less element, `m` remains the same, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result, and `arr` is not affected**
