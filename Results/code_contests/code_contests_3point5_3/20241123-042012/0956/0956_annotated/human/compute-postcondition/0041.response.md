Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is compared with the first element of `t` after removing it. If `i` is less than the removed element, `poss` is updated to reflect this comparison. The previous values of `i`, `t`, and `poss` are not provided, so the output state is: `t` has at least 1 index, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains one more value, `poss` reflects the updated comparison results.
Output State: **`t` has at least 1 index, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains one more value, `poss` reflects the updated comparison results**
