According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters in the input string `s` to enumerate. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `i` is the index at which the last character was processed, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, `s` is not empty, `i` is the index of the last character processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `i` is the index of the last character processed, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, `s` is not empty, `i` is the index of the last character processed + 1**
