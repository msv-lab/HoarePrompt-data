Example Answer:
The value of `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the result of comparing `i` with the leftmost value of `t`. The previous values of `poss`, `i`, and `t` are not provided, so the output state is: `t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains the values of removed indices from `m`, `poss` reflects the comparison results.
Output State: **`t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains the values of removed indices from `m`, `poss` reflects the comparison results**
