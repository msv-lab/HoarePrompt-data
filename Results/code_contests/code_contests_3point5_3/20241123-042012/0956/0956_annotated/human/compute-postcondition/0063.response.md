Output State: **At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque with some indices removed where the current value of `t` is `t-1`, `m` is the input integer and the value `i` appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False, `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, and `si` is the next character in the string `s`.**
