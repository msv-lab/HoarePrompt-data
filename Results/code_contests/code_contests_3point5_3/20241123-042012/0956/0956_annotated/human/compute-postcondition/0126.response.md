According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions that `t` and `m` have at least one index each, and the size of `t` is at least 2. If these conditions are met, the loop will execute. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the states must be adjusted accordingly:
State: **`t` has at least one index, `m` has at least one index, size of `t` is at least 2, `poss` based on the comparison result of elements from `t` and `m`, and `arr` contains the first element of `m` assigned to the corresponding index.**
