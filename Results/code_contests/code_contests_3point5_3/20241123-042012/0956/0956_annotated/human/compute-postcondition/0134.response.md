Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is a boolean that reflects whether all elements at the first half of `t` indices are less than the corresponding elements at the beginning of `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` is a list where the first half of the elements are the corresponding elements from `m` and the rest are zeros. If the size of `t` is less than 2 or `m` is empty, `poss` remains True. After the loop executes, `poss` is True if all elements at the first half of `t` indices are less than the corresponding elements at the beginning of `m`, otherwise False. All other variables maintain their original state.***
