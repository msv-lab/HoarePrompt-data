Output State: **If `t` has less than 2 indices or `m` has less than 1 index, the loop does not execute, and `poss` remains True. Otherwise, after the loop, `t` will have its initial indices removed, `m` will have its first index removed for each iteration, `arr` will contain the values of the removed indices from `m`, and `poss` will reflect whether all comparisons were successful.**
