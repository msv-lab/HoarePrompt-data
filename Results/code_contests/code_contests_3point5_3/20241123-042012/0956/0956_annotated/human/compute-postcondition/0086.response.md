Example Answer:
The value of `poss` is updated to the logical AND of its current value and the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. Since `poss` is already False, the logical AND with any value will result in False. Therefore, after execution, `poss` remains False.
Output State: **Length of `t` is now at least 1, `poss` is False, the index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, and `arr` still has more elements**
