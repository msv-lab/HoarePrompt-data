According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the length of `t` is at least 1, `poss` is False, the index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, and `arr` still has more elements. 

To execute the loop one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `arr` still has more elements.
State: **Length of `t` is now at least 1, `poss` is False, the index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, and `arr` still has more elements**
