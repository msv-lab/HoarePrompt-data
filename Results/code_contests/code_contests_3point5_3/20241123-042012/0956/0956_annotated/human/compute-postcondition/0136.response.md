According to the code, the loop will execute t number of times. At the end of the last iteration, all variables maintain their original state, except func_2 is called with 'YES' if poss is True, otherwise 'NO'. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to adjust the value of t to one more than the current value.
State: **All variables maintain their original state, except func_2 is called with 'YES' if poss is True, otherwise 'NO', t is one more than the current value**
