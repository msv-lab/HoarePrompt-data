Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T'. If the first character in the string `s` is 'T', `i` is appended to `t`. If the first character in the string `s` is not 'T', `m` is a deque containing the value of `i`, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, `s` is not empty, `i` is 0.***
