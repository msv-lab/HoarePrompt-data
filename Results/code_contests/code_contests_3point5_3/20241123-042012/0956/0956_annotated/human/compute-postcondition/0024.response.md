Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False after the loop executes if `args` is not empty; otherwise `at_start` remains unchanged (True). If `flush` is popped from `kwargs` and its value is True, then `file.flush()` is executed. If `flush` is not present in `kwargs` or its value is False, no action is taken on `file`.***
