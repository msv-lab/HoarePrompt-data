According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more values in the `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains more values, `poss` reflects the comparison results. To execute the loop one more time, `arr` must have at least one additional value for the next iteration.
State: **`t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains one more value, `poss` reflects the comparison results**
