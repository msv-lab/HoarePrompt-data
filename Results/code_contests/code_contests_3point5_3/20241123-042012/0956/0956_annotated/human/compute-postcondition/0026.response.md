Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It initializes values for `sep` and `file` based on the given keyword arguments. Then, it iterates through `args`, writing each element to the specified file stream with the provided separator. Finally, it writes the 'end' keyword argument to the file, and if 'flush' is True, it flushes the file stream. The function does not have a return value explicitly mentioned in the description. **
