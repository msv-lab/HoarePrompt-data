According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the length of `t` is at least 1, `poss` is False, the index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, and `poss` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **Length of `t` is now at least 1, `poss` is False, the index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, `poss` is False, and `arr` still has more elements**
