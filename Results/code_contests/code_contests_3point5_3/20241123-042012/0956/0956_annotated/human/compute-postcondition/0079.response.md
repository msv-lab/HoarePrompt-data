According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of the length of the deque `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `len(t)` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False if the index dequeued from `t` is not less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` will be called with 'YES', `arr` is a list with the first element being the index dequeued from `m`, `i` is 4, `len(t)` is at least 2, and `arr[i]` is assigned the value dequeued from `m`.**
