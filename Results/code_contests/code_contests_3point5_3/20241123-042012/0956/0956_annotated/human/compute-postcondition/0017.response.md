Example Answer: 
The program writes the string representation of `x` to the file. If `at_start` is True, `sep` is written to the file before `x`. If `at_start` is already True, then no changes occur. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is True, and the program writes `sep` followed by the string representation of `x` to the file.
Output State: **`at_start` is True, and the program writes `sep` followed by the string representation of `x` to the file**
