According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. For each iteration of the loop, `poss` is False if the index dequeued from `t` is not less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` will be called with 'YES', and `arr` is updated with the index dequeued from `m`. So, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **Length of `t` is at least 2, `poss` is True, index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` is updated with the index dequeued from `m`**
