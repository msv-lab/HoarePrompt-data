Output State: **At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True, `func_2` will be called with 'YES', and `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half the length of `t`.**
