Example Answer: 
The `file.write(str(x))` statement writes the string representation of `x` to the file. If `at_start` is True, there is no `sep` written before `x`. The value of `at_start` is True, but the value of `x` is not given, so the output state after execution is: `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`at_start` is True**
