Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, and `n` is the input integer.
Output State: **`t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements, and `n` is the input integer**
