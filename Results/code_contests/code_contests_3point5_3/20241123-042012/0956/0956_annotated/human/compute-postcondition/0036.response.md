According to the code, the loop can execute if `t` has at least 2 indices and `m` has at least 1 index. Also, the variable `arr` should have been initialized with the indices of `m` that are removed during each iteration. After the loop, `poss` should reflect whether all comparisons were successful. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains the values of removed indices from `m`, `poss` reflects the comparison results**
