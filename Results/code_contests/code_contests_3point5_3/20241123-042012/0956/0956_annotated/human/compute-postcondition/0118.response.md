According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `i < len(t) // 2` is true. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque containing at least 1 index where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` is a list with the first element assigned the value popped from `m`, `i` is 0.

To execute the loop one more time, the condition `i < len(t) // 2` should still hold true. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to increment by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is a deque containing at least 1 index where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` is a list with the first element assigned the value popped from `m`, `i` is 1**
