Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared to the leftmost element of `t`, and the result is stored in `poss` using the bitwise AND assignment operator. The previous values of `i`, `t`, and `poss` are unknown, so the output state is: `t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains more values, `poss` reflects the comparison results.
Output State: **`t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains more values, `poss` reflects the comparison results**
