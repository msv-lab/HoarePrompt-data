According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of the deque `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be incremented by 1.
State: **`t` is a deque containing at least 1 index where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` is a list with the first element assigned the value popped from `m`, `i` is 3, `arr` at index `i` is assigned the value popped from `m`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison result of `t.popleft()` and `m[0]`**
