Based on the code provided, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. `t` should have one less element than the previous iteration.
2. `m` should remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.
3. `poss` should be updated based on the comparison result.
4. `arr` should still have elements remaining for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` has one less element, `m` remains the same, `poss` is updated, `arr` still has elements remaining**
