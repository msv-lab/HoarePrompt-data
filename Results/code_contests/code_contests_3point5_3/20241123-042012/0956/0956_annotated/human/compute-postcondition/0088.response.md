Output State: **If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', and `arr` is updated with the index dequeued from `m`. Length of `t` is at least 1, `poss` is False, index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements.**
