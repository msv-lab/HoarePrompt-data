Output State: **At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque with some indices removed where the current value of `t` is `t-1`, `m` is a deque with the value `i` appended to it if the first character in the string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False, and the function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `si` is the next character in the string `s`, and `m` has the value `i` appended to it.**
