According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of the length of deque `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` will be called with 'YES', `arr` is a list with the first element being the index dequeued from `m`, `i` is 1, `len(t)` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` will be called with 'YES', `arr` is a list with the first element being the index dequeued from `m`, `i` is 2, `len(t)` is at least 2**
