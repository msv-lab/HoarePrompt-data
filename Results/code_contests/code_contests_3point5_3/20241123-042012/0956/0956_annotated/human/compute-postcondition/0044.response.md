Postcondition: ***At the end of the if block, `t` is a deque containing the indices of characters 'T' in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of characters that are not 'T' in the string `s`, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, and `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise `poss` is False. If the input string `s` does not contain any 'T' characters, `t` remains empty, and if `s` is an empty string, both `t` and `m` will be empty deques. If `t` has less than 2 indices or `m` has less than 1 index, the loop does not execute, and `poss` remains True. Otherwise, after the loop, `t` will have its initial indices removed, `m` will have its first index removed for each iteration, `arr` will contain the values of the removed indices from `m`, and `poss` will reflect whether all comparisons were successful.***
