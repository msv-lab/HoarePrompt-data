According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and the current index `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a deque with some indices removed where the current value of `t` is `t-1`, `m` is a deque with the value `i` appended to it if the first character in the string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False, and the function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO', `i` is 0, and `si` is the first character in the string `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` should be incremented by 1.
2. `si` should be assigned to the next character in the string `s`.
3. If the current value of `si` is 'T', `i` should be appended to `t`; if it is not 'T', `i` should be appended to `m`.

State: **At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque with some indices removed where the current value of `t` is `t-1`, `m` is a deque with the value `i` appended to it if the first character in the string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False, and the function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, and `si` is the next character in the string `s`.**
