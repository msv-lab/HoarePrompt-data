Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful and False otherwise. If `s` is empty, then `t` and `m` will remain empty and `func_2` will be called with 'NO'. If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', and `arr` is updated with the index dequeued from `m`. Length of `t` is at least 1, `poss` is False, index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements.***
