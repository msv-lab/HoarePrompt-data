Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque with some indices removed where the current value of `t` is `t-1`, `m` is a deque with the value `i` appended to it if the first character in the string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False. The function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'. `i` is incremented by 1, and `si` is the next character in the string `s`. If the character `si` is 'T', then `i` is appended to `t`, otherwise `i` is appended to `m`.***
