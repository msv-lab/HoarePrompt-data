Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True, `func_2` will be called with 'YES'. If `s` is empty, then `t` and `m` will remain empty and `func_2` will be called with 'NO'.***
