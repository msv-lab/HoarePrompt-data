Output State: **At the end of the loop, if the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, for each iteration of the loop, `poss` is False if the index dequeued from `t` is not less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` will be called with 'YES', and `arr` is updated with the index dequeued from `m`.**
