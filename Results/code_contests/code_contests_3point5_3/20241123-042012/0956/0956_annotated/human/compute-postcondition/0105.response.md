Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T'. If the character `si` is 'T', the index `i` is appended to `t`, and `i` is the index of the last character processed + 1. Otherwise, if the character `si` is not 'T', the index `i` is not appended to `t`, and `m` contains the appended value of `i`. The variables `n`, `s`, `poss`, `func_2` remain unchanged, `arr` still has more elements, and `s` is not empty.***
