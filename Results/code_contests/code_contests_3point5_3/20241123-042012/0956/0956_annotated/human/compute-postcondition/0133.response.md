Output State: **If the size of `t` is at least 2 and `m` has at least one index, `poss` will be True if all elements at the first half of `t` indices are less than the corresponding elements at the beginning of `m`, otherwise False. After each iteration, the first element of `m` will be assigned to the `arr` list at the corresponding index. If the size of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `poss` remains True, and `arr` remains a list of zeros.**
