According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `arr`. If there are more values in `arr`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains the values of removed indices from `m`, `poss` reflects the comparison results. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must contain more values.
State: **`t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has at least 1 index, `arr` contains more values, `poss` reflects the comparison results**
