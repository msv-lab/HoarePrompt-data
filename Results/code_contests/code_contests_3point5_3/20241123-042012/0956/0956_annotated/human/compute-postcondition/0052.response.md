Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque with some indices removed where the current value of `t` is `t-1`, `m` is an empty deque, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False, and the function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO', `i` is 0, and `si` is the first character in the string `s`. The first character in the string `s` is 'T'***
