Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T'. `n`, `s`, `poss`, `func_2` remain unchanged, `arr` still has more elements, `s` is not empty, index `i` is the index of the last character processed + 1, and character `si` is the next character in the input string `s`. Depending on the value of `si`, either the index `i` is appended to `t` if `si` is 'T', or `m` if `si` is not 'T'.***
