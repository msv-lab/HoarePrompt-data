According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least one index, `m` has at least one index, size of `t` is at least 2, `poss` is based on the comparison result of elements from `t` and `m`, and `arr` contains the first element of `m` assigned to the corresponding index.

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `arr` needs to be available for iteration. This means that the current index of `arr` needs to be less than the size of `m` to ensure there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over. Adjusting the states:
State: **`t` has at least one index, `m` has at least one index, size of `t` is at least 2, `poss` is based on the comparison result of elements from `t` and `m`, and `arr` contains the next element of `m` assigned to the corresponding index**
