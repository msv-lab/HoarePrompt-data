According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t` and the length of `t`. If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful and False otherwise. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time:
1. If the length of `t` is at least 2, then the loop will execute again.
2. If the length of `t` is at least 1, `poss` is False, and the index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, then the loop will execute again.

State: **`t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements**
