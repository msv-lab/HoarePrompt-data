Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of characters 'T' in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of characters that are not 'T' in the string `s` with the first two indices removed, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t` and the condition `t.popleft() < m[0]` holds true, otherwise `poss` is False, `t` has a length of at least 4, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the length of deque `t` and `arr[i]` is assigned the value of the next index of `m` that is removed, `poss` is updated according to the condition `t.popleft() < m[0]`.**
