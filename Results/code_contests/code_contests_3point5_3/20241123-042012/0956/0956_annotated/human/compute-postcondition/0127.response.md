Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared with the first element of `t` after removing it with `popleft()`. If `i` is less than the first element of `t`, then `poss` will remain `True`, otherwise, it will become `False`. The `arr` variable remains unaffected. 
Output State: **`t` has at least one index, `m` has at least one index, size of `t` is at least 2, `poss` is based on the comparison result of elements from `t` and `m`, and `arr` contains the first element of `m` assigned to the corresponding index**
