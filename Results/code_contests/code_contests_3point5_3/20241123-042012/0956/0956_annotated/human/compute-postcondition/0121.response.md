According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than half the length of deque `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque containing at least 1 index where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` is a list with the first element assigned the value popped from `m`, `i` is 1, `arr` at index `i` is assigned the value popped from `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 to satisfy the condition `i` is less than half the length of deque `t`.
State: **`t` is a deque containing at least 1 index where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T', `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` is a list with the first element assigned the value popped from `m`, `i` is 2, `arr` at index `i` is assigned the value popped from `m`**
