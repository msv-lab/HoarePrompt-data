According to the code, the loop will execute `t` number of times, where `t` is the input integer. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque with some indices removed, `m` is a deque with some indices removed, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False, and the function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` needs to be adjusted to `t-1` to indicate that one iteration has been completed. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque with some indices removed where the current value of `t` is `t-1`, `m` is a deque with some indices removed, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False, and the function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'**
