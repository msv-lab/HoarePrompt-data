Example Answer:
The `write` method of the file object `file` writes the separator `sep` to the file. The boolean variable `at_start` remains false, and the elements in `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is an iterable containing elements, `at_start` is false.
Output State: **`args` is an iterable containing elements, `at_start` is false**
