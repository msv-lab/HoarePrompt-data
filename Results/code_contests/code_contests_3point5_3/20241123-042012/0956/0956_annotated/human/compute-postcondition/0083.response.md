According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the length of `t` is at least 1, `poss` is False, the index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` is updated with the index dequeued from `m`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` needs to have more elements.
State: **Length of `t` is now at least 1, `poss` is False, index dequeued from `t` is less than the first index dequeued from `m`, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements**
