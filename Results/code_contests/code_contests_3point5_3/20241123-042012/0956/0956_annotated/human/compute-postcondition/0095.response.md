Example Answer:
The variable `m` is reassigned to an empty deque. The previous values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `poss`, `func_2`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is an empty deque, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements.
Output State: **`t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is an empty deque, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is False, `func_2` is called with 'YES', `arr` has more elements**
