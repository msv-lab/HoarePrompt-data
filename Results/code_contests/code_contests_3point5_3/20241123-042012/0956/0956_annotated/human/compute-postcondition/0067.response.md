Output State: At the end of the loop, `t` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing indices where the corresponding character in the input string `s` is not 'T'. `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `poss` is True if all comparisons were successful, otherwise False. The function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'. If the input string `s` is empty, then `t` and `m` will remain empty, and `func_2` will be called with 'NO'. `poss` is assigned the value of whether the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`.
