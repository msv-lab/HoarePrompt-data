According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `arr`. If there are still elements left in the `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has one less element, `m` remains the same, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result, and `arr` is not affected. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `arr` should still have elements remaining to iterate over.
State: **`t` has one less element, `m` remains the same, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result, and `arr` still has elements remaining**
