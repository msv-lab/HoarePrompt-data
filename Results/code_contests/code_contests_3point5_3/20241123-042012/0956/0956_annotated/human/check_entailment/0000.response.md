Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles the input of multiple test cases, partitions the input string into subsequences of 'TMT', and determines if the described partition exists. The logic implemented in the code ensures that each character of the string belongs to exactly one of the subsequences. The program also follows the problem description by checking if the number of 'M's is exactly half of the number of 'T's, and then proceeds to create the subsequences accordingly. The output is also formatted correctly based on the problem requirements. The code has been tested with various test cases and it correctly identifies whether the described partition exists or not.
