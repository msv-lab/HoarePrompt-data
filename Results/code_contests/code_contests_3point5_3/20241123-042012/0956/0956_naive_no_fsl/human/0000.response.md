Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and determines whether it is possible to partition the given string into disjoint subsequences equal to TMT. The logic used to check the possibility of partitioning is implemented correctly, considering the conditions mentioned in the problem description. The program then outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the result of the partitioning check. The implementation seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
