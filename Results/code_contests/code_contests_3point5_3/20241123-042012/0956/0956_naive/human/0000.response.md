Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to partition the given string into disjoint subsequences, all equal to TMT. The program iterates through the string and separates the indices of 'T' and 'M', ensuring that the count of 'M' is half of the count of 'T'. It then checks if the indices are in the correct order to form the required subsequences. If all conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
