According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `i`, `si` remain the same, and `poss` is updated based on the condition mentioned. The key adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is to update `arr` with the first element of `m` deque removed. No other states need adjustment.
State: **If `s` is empty, `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T'. `n`, `i`, `si` remain same, `poss` is updated, `arr` is updated with the first element of `m` deque removed**
