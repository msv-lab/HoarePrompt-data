According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one element in the args list. Before the loop starts, `args` needs to have at least one element for the loop to execute. Additionally, for the loop to execute, the `sep` and `file` variables need to be provided in the kwargs dictionary. Therefore, the states to be adjusted are: `args` has at least one element, `sep` is provided in kwargs, `file` is provided in kwargs, and `at_start` remains True.
State: **`sep` is provided in kwargs, `file` is provided in kwargs, `at_start` is True, `args` has at least one element**
