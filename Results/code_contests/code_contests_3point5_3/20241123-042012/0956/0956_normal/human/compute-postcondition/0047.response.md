Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: If `s` is not empty, `t` and `m` deques are not empty and meet the conditions for `poss` to be True, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **If `s` is not empty, `t` and `m` deques are not empty and meet the conditions for `poss` to be True, `n` is an input integer**
