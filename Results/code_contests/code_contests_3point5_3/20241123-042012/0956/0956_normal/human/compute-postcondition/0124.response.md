According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of deque `t`. If the length of deque `t` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s` with reduced length by 2, `m` is a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the (i+1)th element assigned the value popped from the left of deque `m`, and `poss` is False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of deque `t` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s` with reduced length by 4, `m` is a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the (i+1)th element assigned the value popped from the left of deque `m`, and `poss` is False**
