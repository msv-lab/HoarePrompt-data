According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` should not be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop, and `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the condition i < t.popleft(). The condition i < t.popleft() should be satisfied by the next element in `arr` and `arr` should not be empty**
