According to the code, the loop will execute until all elements in `args` have been processed. At the end of the previous iteration, if `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to file. Elements in `args` remain unchanged and the next element in `args` is processed. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `args` needs to be processed.
State: **If at_start is False, sep is written to file. Elements in args remain unchanged and the next element in args is processed.**
