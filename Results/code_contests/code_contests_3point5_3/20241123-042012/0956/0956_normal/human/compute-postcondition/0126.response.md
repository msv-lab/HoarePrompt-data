According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`, which should be at least 2. If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. Before the loop starts, `t` will be a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s` with reduced length by 'i', `m` will be a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`, `poss` will be False, and `arr` will be a list with the (i+1)th element assigned the value popped from the left of deque `m`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` needs to have at least 2 elements, `m` should have corresponding elements, `poss` should be False, and `arr` should be configured accordingly. 
State: **`t` has at least 2 elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is False, `arr` is configured correctly**
