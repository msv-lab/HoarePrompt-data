According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `t` deque having at least 2 elements. If `t` deque has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute. At the end of the last iteration, `s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains the indices of 'T' elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T', `poss` is True if all elements in 'arr' are less than the corresponding elements in 't', and `poss` is False if any element in 'arr' is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 't'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `t` deque has less than 2 elements, you need to ensure that `t` deque has at least 2 elements.
2. No adjustment is needed for `s`, `m`, or `poss` as they are not criteria for the loop execution.

State: **`s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains at least 2 elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T', `poss` is True if all elements in 'arr' are less than the corresponding elements in 't', and `poss` is False if any element in 'arr' is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 't'**
