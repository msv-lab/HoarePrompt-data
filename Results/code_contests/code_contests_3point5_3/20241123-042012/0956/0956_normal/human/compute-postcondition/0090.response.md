Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains the indices of 'T' elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T', `poss` is True if all elements in 'arr' are less than the corresponding elements in 't', and `poss` is False if any element in 'arr' is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 't'. If 't' deque has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute. The function `func_2` is called with argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'.**
