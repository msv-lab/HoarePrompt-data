Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `t`. The previous values of `t` are not specified, so we can't determine the exact state of `t` after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has more elements, `si` is the next element in `s`, `i` is the index of the next element in `s`, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer, and `t` has been appended with the value of `i`.
Output State: **`s` has more elements, `si` is the next element in `s`, `i` is the index of the next element in `s`, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer, and `t` has been appended with the value of `i`**
