According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, if `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file. The elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `args` needs to be processed.
State: **If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file. The elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed.**
