According to the code, the loop can execute if there are elements in both `t` and `m` deques. If either `t` or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute. 

Considering this, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- If `s` is not empty, `t` should contain the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T'.
- If `s` is not empty, `m` should contain the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T'.
- `poss` should be True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise False.
- `arr` should contain the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop.

Output State: **If `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop.**
