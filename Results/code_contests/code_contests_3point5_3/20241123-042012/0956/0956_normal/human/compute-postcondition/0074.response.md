Example Answer:
The code checks if the leftmost element of deque `t` is less than the first element of deque `m`. If this condition is met, the `poss` variable is updated to True, otherwise, it remains False. Since elements are popped from `t` and `m` and `poss` is updated based on the comparison, the affected variables are `poss`, `t`, and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains at least 1 index of 'T' elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T' with the first index removed, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the length of deque `t`, `i` is 2**
