Output State: **If both `t` and `m` deques are not empty, `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop. `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise it is False. If either `t` or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute.**
