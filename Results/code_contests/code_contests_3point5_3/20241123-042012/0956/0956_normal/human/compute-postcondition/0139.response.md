Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes user input for the number of test cases `t`, then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it processes the input string `s` consisting of characters 'T' and 'M' by finding the indices of 'T' and non-'T' elements. It checks if the number of non-'T' elements is half the number of 'T' elements and updates the boolean variable `poss` accordingly. If the condition is met, it extracts specific elements from the two deques `t` and `m` and compares them, updating `poss` based on the comparison. The function then calls `func_2` with 'YES' if `poss` is True, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not have specific return values and processes the test cases based on the defined constraints.**
