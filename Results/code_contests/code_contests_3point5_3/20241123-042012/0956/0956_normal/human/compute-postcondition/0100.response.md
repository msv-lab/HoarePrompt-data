Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to deque `m`. Since `i` is 0, after execution, deque `m` will contain 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty iterable, `t` is an empty deque, `m` is a deque containing 0, `i` is 0, `si` is the first element of `s`, and the first element of `s` is not 'T'.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty iterable, `t` is an empty deque, `m` is a deque containing 0, `i` is 0, `si` is the first element of `s`, the first element of `s` is not 'T'**
