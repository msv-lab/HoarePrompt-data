According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the 'arr' list. If there are more elements in 'arr', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, 't' deque has elements after removing the leftmost element, 'm' deque remains unchanged, 'arr' still has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the comparison result, and 'i' is the next element in 'arr'. To execute the loop one more time, the 'arr' list must still have more elements, so 'i' should not be the last element in 'arr'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **'t' deque has elements after removing the leftmost element, 'm' deque remains unchanged, 'arr' still has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the comparison result, and 'i' is the next element in 'arr'**
