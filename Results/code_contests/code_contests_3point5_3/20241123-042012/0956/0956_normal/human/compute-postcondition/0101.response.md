Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty iterable, `t` is a deque containing 0 if the first element of `s` is 'T', `m` is an empty deque if the first element of `s` is 'T', `m` is a deque containing 0 if the first element of `s` is not 'T', `i` is 0, `si` is the first element of `s`. If the first element of `s` is 'T', then 0 is appended to `t`. If the first element of `s` is not 'T', then 0 is appended to `m`.***
