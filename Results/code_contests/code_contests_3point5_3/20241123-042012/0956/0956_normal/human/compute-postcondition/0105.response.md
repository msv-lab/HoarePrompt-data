Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the first element of `s`, `i` is incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`. If `si` is 'T', then the value of `i` is appended to deque `t`. Otherwise, the value of `i` is appended to deque `m`. This holds for all possible scenarios where `si` can be 'T' or not 'T'.***
