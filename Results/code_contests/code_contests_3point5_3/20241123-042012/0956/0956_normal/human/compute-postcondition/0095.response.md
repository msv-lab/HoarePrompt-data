Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned an empty deque. The value of `s` is assigned the input value, and `t` is an empty deque. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is assigned the input value, `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque.
Output State: **`s` is assigned the input value, `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque**
