Output State: **After the loop executes, `t` will be a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s`, `m` will be a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`. The loop will execute for each element in `s`, appending the index to `t` if the element is 'T' and to `m` if the element is not 'T'. If `s` is an empty iterable, `t` and `m` will remain empty deques.**
