According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. If the length of `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`, `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' elements in `s` is half the number of 'T' elements, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half the number of 'T' elements in `s`, and the length of `t` is at least 1**.
