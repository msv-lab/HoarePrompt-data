According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `t` is at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has a length of at least 1, which means the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should have a length of at least 2.
State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`, `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' elements in `s` is half the number of 'T' elements, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half the number of 'T' elements in `s`, the length of `t` is at least 2, and `poss` is False.**
