Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains at least 2 elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T', `poss` is True if all elements in 'arr' are less than the corresponding elements in 't', and `poss` is False if any element in 'arr' is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 't', `n` is an input integer.
