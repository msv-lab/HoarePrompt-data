According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of deque `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and the length of deque `t` is at least 2, so the loop can execute one more time. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains at least 1 index of 'T' elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T' with the first index removed, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the length of deque `t`, `i` is 3, and `arr[i]` is assigned the value of the element removed from deque `m`.**
