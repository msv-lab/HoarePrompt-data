According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the 'arr'. If there are more elements in 'arr', the loop will execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, 't' deque has elements after removing the leftmost element, 'm' deque remains unchanged, 'arr' still has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the new comparison result, and 'i' is the next element in 'arr'. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, 'arr' must still have elements after 'i', and 'i' should be pointing to the next element in 'arr'.
State: **'t' deque has elements after removing the leftmost element, 'm' deque remains unchanged, 'arr' still has elements after 'i', 'poss' is either True or False based on the new comparison result, and 'i' is the next element in 'arr'**
