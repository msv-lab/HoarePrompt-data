Postcondition: ***`s` has more elements, `si` is the next element in `s`, `i` is the index of the next element in `s`, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer. If `si` is 'T', `t` deque contains [0] if `si` is 'T' and `i` otherwise. If `si` is not 'T', `m` deque contains [0] if `si` is not 'T' and `i` otherwise. In the else part, if `si` is not 'T', `m` deque contains [0, i] if `si` is not 'T' and is empty otherwise.***
