Output State: **The loop iterates through each element in the list `s` and appends the index `i` to deque `t` if the element is 'T', or appends it to deque `m` if the element is not 'T'. After the loop executes, `s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains the indices of 'T' elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T', `poss` remains True, and `n` is the input integer. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `t` and `m` remain empty.**
