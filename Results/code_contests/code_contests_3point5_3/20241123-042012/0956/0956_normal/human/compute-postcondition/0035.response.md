Output State: 
If `s` is empty, `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T'. `n`, `i`, `si` remain the same throughout the loop. `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise it is False. `arr` is a list that stores the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop. The loop checks a condition where the first element of `t` deque is less than the first element of `m` deque, and then it removes the first element of `m` deque and assigns it to the corresponding index in `arr`. The loop will execute at least once if there are elements in both `t` and `m` deques. If either `t` or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute. 
**Output State: `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop.**
