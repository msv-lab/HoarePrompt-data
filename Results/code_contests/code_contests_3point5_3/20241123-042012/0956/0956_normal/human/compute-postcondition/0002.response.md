Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ' if 'sep' is not provided in kwargs, `file` is `sys.stdout` if 'file' is not provided in kwargs, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ' if 'sep' is not provided in kwargs, `file` is `sys.stdout` if 'file' is not provided in kwargs, `at_start` is True**
