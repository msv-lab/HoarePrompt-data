Postcondition: ***`s` is not empty, `si` is the first element in `s`, `i` is 0, `t` deque contains [0] if `si` is 'T' and is empty otherwise, `m` deque contains [0] if `si` is not 'T' and is empty otherwise, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer. If `si` is 'T', then `i` is appended to deque `t`. If `si` is not 'T', then `i` is appended to deque `m`.***
