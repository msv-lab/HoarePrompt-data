According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables 't', 'm', and 'arr'. If 't' has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, 'poss' is set to False if t.popleft() < m[0] is not satisfied. To ensure the loop executes, 't' should have at least 2 elements, 'm' should have at least 1 element, and 'arr' should have elements. At the start of the loop, 'i' is the first element of 'arr'.
State: **'t' deque has at least 2 elements, 'm' deque has at least 1 element, 'arr' has elements, 'poss' is set to False if t.popleft() < m[0] is not satisfied, 'i' is the first element of 'arr'**
