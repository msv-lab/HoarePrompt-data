Example Answer:
The value of 'i' is compared with the leftmost element of deque 't'. If 'i' is less than the leftmost element of 't', then 'poss' remains True, otherwise 'poss' becomes False. After the comparison, the leftmost element of 't' is removed. Therefore, the Output State is: 't' deque has elements after removing the leftmost element, 'm' deque remains unchanged, 'arr' still has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the new comparison result, and 'i' is the next element in 'arr'.
Output State: **'t' deque has elements after removing the leftmost element, 'm' deque remains unchanged, 'arr' still has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the new comparison result, and 'i' is the next element in 'arr'**
