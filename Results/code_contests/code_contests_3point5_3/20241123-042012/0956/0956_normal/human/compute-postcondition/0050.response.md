Example Answer:
`m` is reassigned to an empty deque. The previous value of `m` was not provided, so it is now empty. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is not empty, `t` deque is empty, `m` deque is empty, `poss` is True, and `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`s` is not empty, `t` deque is empty, `m` deque is empty, `poss` is True, and `n` is an input integer**
