Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and then `i` is appended to deque `t`. Deque `t` is based on the first element of iterable `s`, so `i` is added to deque `t`. The value of `si` is updated to the next element in `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` is a deque containing the updated values based on the first element of `s`, `i` is incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` is a deque containing the updated values based on the first element of `s`, `i` is incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`**
