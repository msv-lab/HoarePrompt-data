Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared to the first element of `t` after removing it using `popleft()` function. If `i` is less than the removed element, `poss` becomes True, otherwise, it remains False. The state of `m` is not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True depending on the comparison result, `arr` has more elements**
