Output State: **If `s` is empty, `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T'. `n`, `i`, `si` remain the same, `poss` is updated with the condition `t.popleft() < m[0]`, `arr` is updated with the first element of `m` deque removed, `arr` is updated with the first element of `m` deque removed, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
