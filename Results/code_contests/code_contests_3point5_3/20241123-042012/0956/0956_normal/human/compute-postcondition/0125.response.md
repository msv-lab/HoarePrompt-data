Output State: **After the loop executes, `t` will be a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s` with reduced length by 'i', `m` will be a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`, `poss` will be False, `arr` will be a list with the (i+1)th element assigned the value popped from the left of deque `m`, and `poss` will be False after the loop executes 'i' times. If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `poss` remains True, with `arr` being a list of zeros with a length equal to half the number of 'T' elements in `s`.**
