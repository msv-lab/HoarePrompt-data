Example Answer:
The value of 'i' is compared with the value of the first element of 't' after removing it. If 'i' is less than the removed element, 'poss' remains True; otherwise, it becomes False. Since 'poss' is set to False if the condition is not satisfied, it will remain False if 'i' is not less than the removed element. Therefore, the Output State is: 't' deque has at least 1 element, 'm' deque has at least 1 element, 'arr' has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the comparison, and 'i' is the first element of 'arr'.
Output State: **'t' deque has at least 1 element, 'm' deque has at least 1 element, 'arr' has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the comparison, and 'i' is the first element of 'arr'**
