Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the next element in `s`, `i` is further incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`. If `si` is equal to 'T', then the value of `i` is appended to deque `t`. If `si` is not equal to 'T', then the value of `i` is appended to deque `m`, which now contains the previous elements in `m` along with `i`.***
