Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared to the first element of `t` after removing it. If `i` is less than the first element of `t`, then `poss` is set to True, otherwise, it remains False. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True depending on the comparison result, `arr` still has more elements.
Output State: **`t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True depending on the comparison result, `arr` still has more elements**
