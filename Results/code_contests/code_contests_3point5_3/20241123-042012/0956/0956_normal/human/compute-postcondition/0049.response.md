Example Answer: 
A deque `t` is initialized as an empty deque. The previous values of the affected variables are `s` is not empty, `t` and `m` deques are not empty, `poss` is True, and `n` is an input integer. Initializing `t` as an empty deque does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is not empty, `t` deque is empty, `m` deque is not empty, `poss` is True, and `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`s` is not empty, `t` deque is empty, `m` deque is not empty, `poss` is True, and `n` is an input integer**
