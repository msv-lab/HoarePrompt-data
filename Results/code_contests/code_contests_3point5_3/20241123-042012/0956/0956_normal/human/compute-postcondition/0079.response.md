At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:

State: **`s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains at least 1 index of 'T' elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T' with the first index removed, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the length of deque `t`, `i` is 3, and `arr[i]` is assigned the value of the element removed from deque `m`, `poss` is True if the condition t.popleft() < m[0] is satisfied, otherwise False.**

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
2. `arr[i]` needs to be assigned the value of the next element removed from deque `m`.
3. The condition `t.popleft() < m[0]` needs to be re-evaluated to update the value of `poss` based on the new elements in `t` and `m`.

Modified State: **`s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains at least 1 index of 'T' elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T' with the first two indices removed, `poss` is either True or False based on the updated condition, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the length of deque `t`, `i` is 4, and `arr[i]` is assigned the value of the next element removed from deque `m`.**
