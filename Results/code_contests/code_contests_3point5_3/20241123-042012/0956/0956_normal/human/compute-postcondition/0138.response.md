The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It works based on the predefined constraints. The function takes into account the number of test cases `t`, the number of characters in the string `n` (which is divisible by 3), and the string `s` consisting of only the characters T and M. The function does not return any specific output as the description provided does not specify any return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the test cases based on the constraints mentioned.
