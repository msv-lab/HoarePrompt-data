Postcondition: ***If `s` is empty, `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', and `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T'. `n`, `i`, and `si` are updated based on the iteration progress. The variable `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise it is False. If both `t` and `m` deques are not empty, `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop. `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise it is False. If either `t` or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute.***
