Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the deque `t`, and `i` is further incremented. The previous values of `s`, `t`, `m`, `i`, and `si` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the next element in `s`, `i` is further incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the next element in `s`, `i` is further incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`**
