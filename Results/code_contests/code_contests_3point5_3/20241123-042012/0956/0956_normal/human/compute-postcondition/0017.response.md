Example Answer: 
The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The state of `at_start` is not affected, so it remains as it was. The elements in `args` are also not changed, and the next element in `args` is processed. Therefore, the Output State is: If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file. The elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed.
Output State: **If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file. The elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed.**
