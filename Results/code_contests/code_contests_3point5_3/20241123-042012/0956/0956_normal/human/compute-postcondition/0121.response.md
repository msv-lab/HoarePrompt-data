According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s` with reduced length by 1, `m` is a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the ith element assigned the value popped from the left of deque `m`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `t` must still be greater than 2 (since we are dividing by 2 in the loop condition), and `i` should be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s` with reduced length by 2, `m` is a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the (i+1)th element assigned the value popped from the left of deque `m`**
