According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True, and `arr` still has more elements. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `arr` has one less element.
State: **`t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True, `arr` has one less element**
