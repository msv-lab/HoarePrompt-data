Postcondition: ***`s` has more elements, `si` is the next element in `s`, `i` is the index of the next element in `s`, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer. If `si` is 'T', then `t` has been appended with the value of `i`. Otherwise, if `si` is not 'T', `m` contains the value of `i`. This covers all possible scenarios of appending `i` to either `t` or `m` based on the value of `si`.***
