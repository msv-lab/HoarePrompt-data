Example Answer:
The value of `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the condition `i < t.popleft()`. If the condition is true, `poss` will remain True, otherwise, it will be False. The elements of `t` are dequeued from the left side. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True, `arr` is configured correctly.
Output State: **`t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True, `arr` is configured correctly**
