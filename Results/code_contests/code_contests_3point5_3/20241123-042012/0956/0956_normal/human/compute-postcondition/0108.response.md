Example Answer: 
`i` is appended to the deque `m`, so the deque `m` now contains the elements `[previous elements in m, i]`. The other variables `s`, `t`, and `si` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the next element in `s`, `i` is further incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`, `m` contains `[previous elements in m, i]`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the next element in `s`, `i` is further incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`, `m` contains `[previous elements in m, i]`**
