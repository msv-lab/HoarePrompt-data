Example Answer:
The value of `sep` is written to the file. The values of `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is written to `file`, elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed.
Output State: **`sep` is written to `file`, elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed**
