Postcondition: ***`s` remains unchanged, `t` deque contains the indices of 'T' elements, `m` deque contains the indices of elements that are not 'T', `poss` is True if all elements in 'arr' are less than the corresponding elements in 't', and `poss` is False if any element in 'arr' is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 't'. If 't' deque has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute.*** The postcondition covers the scenario where 't' and 'm' deques have elements, 'arr' is populated, and 'poss' is updated accordingly based on the comparisons made. Additionally, it accounts for the case where 't' deque has less than 2 elements, preventing the loop execution.
