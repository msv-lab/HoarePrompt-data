Example Answer:
The `sep` variable is written to the file. If `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file. The elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed. Therefore, the Output State is: If `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file. Elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed.
Output State: **If `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file. Elements in `args` remain unchanged, and the next element in `args` is processed.**
