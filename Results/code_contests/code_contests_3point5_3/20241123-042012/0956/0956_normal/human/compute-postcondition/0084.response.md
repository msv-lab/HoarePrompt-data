Example Answer:
The value of 'i' is compared with the leftmost element of deque 't', and the result is stored in 'poss' after applying the bitwise AND operation. If the comparison is true, 'poss' remains True; otherwise, it becomes False. The leftmost element is removed from deque 't'. Therefore, the Output State is: 't' deque has elements after removing the leftmost element, 'm' deque remains unchanged, 'arr' still has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the comparison result, and 'i' is the next element in 'arr'.
Output State: **'t' deque has elements after removing the leftmost element, 'm' deque remains unchanged, 'arr' still has elements, 'poss' is either True or False based on the comparison result, and 'i' is the next element in 'arr'**
