Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is appended to the list `m`. The variable `m` now contains the value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has more elements, `si` is the next element in `s`, `i` is the index of the next element in `s`, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer, `m` contains the value of `i`.
Output State: **`s` has more elements, `si` is the next element in `s`, `i` is the index of the next element in `s`, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer, `m` contains the value of `i`**
