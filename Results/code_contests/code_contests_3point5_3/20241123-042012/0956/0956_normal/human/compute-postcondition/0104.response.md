Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and then `i` is appended to the deque `m`. The deques `t` and `m` were based on the first element of `s`, so they remain unchanged. The next element in `s` is updated to `si`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the first element of `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `si` is updated to the next element in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the first element of `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `si` is updated to the next element in `s`**
