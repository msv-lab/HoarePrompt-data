Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `t` will contain a subset of the original indices of 'T' elements in `s`, `m` will contain corresponding indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`. The boolean `poss` will be True if the number of non-'T' elements in `s` is half the number of 'T' elements, otherwise False. Additionally, if the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `poss` remains True. In each iteration of the loop, `poss` is updated based on the comparison between elements of `t` and `m`. `arr` will store the elements from `m` and will have a length equal to half the number of 'T' elements in `s`.***
