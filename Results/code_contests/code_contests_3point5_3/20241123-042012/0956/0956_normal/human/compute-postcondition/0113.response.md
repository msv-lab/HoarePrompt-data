Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `t` will be a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s`, `m` will be a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`. If `s` is an empty iterable, `t` and `m` will remain empty deques. `poss` will be True if the number of non-'T' elements in `s` is half the number of 'T' elements, otherwise False.***
