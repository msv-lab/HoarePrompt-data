According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the iterable `s`. If there are more elements left in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the first element of `s`, `i` is incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Increment the value of `i`.
2. Update `si` to the next element in `s`.
3. If `si` is 'T', append the value of `i` to deque `t`. Otherwise, append the value of `i` to deque `m`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `t` and `m` are deques based on the next element in `s`, `i` is further incremented, and `si` is updated to the next element in `s`**.
