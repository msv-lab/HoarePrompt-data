Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to deque `m`. The previous states of the affected variables are as follows: `s` has more elements, `si` is the next element in `s`, `i` is the index of the next element in `s`, `t` deque contains [0] if `si` is 'T' and is empty otherwise, `m` deque contains [0] if `si` is not 'T' and is empty otherwise, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer. After the execution of the code, `m` deque now contains the appended value of `i`. 
Output State: **`s` has more elements, `si` is the next element in `s`, `i` is the index of the next element in `s`, `t` deque contains [0] if `si` is 'T' and is empty otherwise, `m` deque contains [0, i] if `si` is not 'T' and is empty otherwise, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer**
