Example Answer:
The expression `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` is assigned to `poss`. The lengths of `m` and `t` are calculated, and if `len(m) * 2` is equal to `len(t)`, then `poss` will be True, otherwise False. The variables `t` and `m` are deques containing the indices of 'T' and non-'T' elements in `s`, respectively. 
Output State: **After the loop executes, `t` will be a deque containing the indices of 'T' elements in `s`, `m` will be a deque containing the indices of elements that are not 'T' in `s`. If `s` is an empty iterable, `t` and `m` will remain empty deques. `poss` will be True if the number of non-'T' elements in `s` is half the number of 'T' elements, otherwise False.**
