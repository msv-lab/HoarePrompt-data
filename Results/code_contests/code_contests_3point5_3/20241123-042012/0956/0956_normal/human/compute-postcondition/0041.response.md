Output State: **`s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop, and `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the condition i < t.popleft(). The condition i < t.popleft() should be satisfied by the next element in `arr` and `arr` should not be empty**
