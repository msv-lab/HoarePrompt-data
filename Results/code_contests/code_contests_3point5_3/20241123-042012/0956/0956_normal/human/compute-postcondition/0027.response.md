Output State: 
If `s` is empty, `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T'. `n`, `i`, `si` remain the same throughout the loop. `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise it is False. `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half the length of `t`, `i` is ranging from 0 to half the length of `t`. The value of `poss` is updated by performing a logical AND operation with the condition that the first element of `t` deque is less than the first element of `m` deque after removing them using `popleft()` operation. After executing the code snippet `arr[i] = m.popleft()`, the first element of `m` deque is removed and assigned to the `i-th` element of `arr`.
**Output State: `arr` is updated with the first element of `m` deque removed.**
