According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition i < t.popleft() and the elements in arr. At the end of the last iteration, the states are: `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop, and `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the condition i < t.popleft(). 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. The condition `i < t.popleft()` needs to be satisfied by the next element in `arr`.
2. If `arr` still has elements to be processed, then `arr` should not be empty.

State: **`s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, `arr` contains the elements removed from the `m` deque in each iteration of the loop, and `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the condition i < t.popleft(). The condition i < t.popleft() should be satisfied by the next element in `arr` and `arr` should not be empty for the loop to execute one more time.**
