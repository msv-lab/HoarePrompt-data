Output State: **The loop checks if the first half of the 't' deque elements are less than the first element of the 'm' deque. It updates the 'arr' list with elements from the 'm' deque. If 't' deque has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute. 'poss' is set to False if the condition t.popleft() < m[0] is not satisfied.**
