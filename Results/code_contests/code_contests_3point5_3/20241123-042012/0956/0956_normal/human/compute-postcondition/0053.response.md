Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `t` deque. Since the initial value of `t` deque is empty and `i` is 0, after execution, `t` deque will contain [0]. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is not empty, `si` is the first element in `s` which is 'T', `i` is 0, `t` deque contains [0], `m` deque is empty, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`s` is not empty, `si` is the first element in `s` which is 'T', `i` is 0, `t` deque contains [0], `m` deque is empty, `poss` is True, `n` is an input integer**
