Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of variable `x` to the file. The states of `at_start`, `sep`, and `args` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: If at_start is False, sep is written to file. Elements in args remain unchanged and the next element in args is processed. If at_start is True, no action is taken.
Output State: **If at_start is False, sep is written to file. Elements in args remain unchanged and the next element in args is processed. If at_start is True, no action is taken.**
