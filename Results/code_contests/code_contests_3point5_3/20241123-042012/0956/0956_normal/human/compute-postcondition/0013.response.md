Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. Since `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to file, and the elements in `args` remain unchanged and the next element in `args` is processed. Therefore, the Output State is: If at_start is False, sep is written to file. Elements in args remain unchanged and the next element in args is processed.
Output State: **If at_start is False, sep is written to file. Elements in args remain unchanged and the next element in args is processed.**
