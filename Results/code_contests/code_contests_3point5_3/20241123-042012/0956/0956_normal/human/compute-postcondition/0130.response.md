According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True depending on the comparison result, `arr` has more elements. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `arr` still has more elements to iterate over.
State: **`t` has fewer elements, `m` has corresponding elements, `poss` is either False or True depending on the comparison result, `arr` still has more elements**
