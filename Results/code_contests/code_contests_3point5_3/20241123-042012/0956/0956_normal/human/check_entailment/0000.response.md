Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function takes input for the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it processes the input string `s` to find the indices of 'T' and non-'T' elements using deques `t` and `m`.
- It checks if the number of non-'T' elements is exactly half the number of 'T' elements and updates the boolean variable `poss` accordingly.
- If the condition is met, it extracts specific elements from the deques `t` and `m`, compares them, and updates `poss` based on the comparison.
- The function then calls `func_2` with 'YES' if `poss` is True, and 'NO' otherwise.

The code seems to address the problem description for every potential case by correctly checking if the input string can be partitioned into subsequences equal to TMT. The output hints also align with the code's logic, reinforcing the correctness of the program.
