The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It handles printing values to a stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. It processes the `kwargs` dictionary to handle optional arguments like `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. The function iterates through elements in `args`, writing them to the `file` separated by `sep`. If the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs`, it flushes the file. The function's main purpose is to customize the output stream based on the provided keyword arguments.
