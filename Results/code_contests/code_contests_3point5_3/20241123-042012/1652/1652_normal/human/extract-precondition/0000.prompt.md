You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Recently you have received two positive integer numbers x and y. You forgot them, but you remembered a shuffled list containing all divisors of x (including 1 and x) and all divisors of y (including 1 and y). If d is a divisor of both numbers x and y at the same time, there are two occurrences of d in the list.

For example, if x=4 and y=6 then the given list can be any permutation of the list [1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6]. Some of the possible lists are: [1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2], [4, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2] or [1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2].

Your problem is to restore suitable positive integer numbers x and y that would yield the same list of divisors (possibly in different order).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i.e. the given list of divisors corresponds to some positive integers x and y.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 128) — the number of divisors of x and y.

The second line of the input contains n integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^4), where d_i is either divisor of x or divisor of y. If a number is divisor of both numbers x and y then there are two copies of this number in the list.

Output

Print two positive integer numbers x and y — such numbers that merged list of their divisors is the permutation of the given list of integers. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Program:
```

def func():
    nb_test = 0
    idx = 0
    for line in sys.stdin:
        if idx != 0:
            list_divisors = map(int, line.strip().split(' '))
            (a, b) = (list_divisors[0], list_divisors[1])
            (a, b) = (b, a) if a > b else (a, b)
            for d in list_divisors[2:]:
                if d >= b:
                    if d % b == 0:
                        b = d
                    elif d % a == 0:
                        a = d
                    (a, b) = (b, a) if a > b else (a, b)
                elif d >= a:
                    if d % a == 0:
                        a = d
            sys.stdout.write('%d %d\n' % (a, b))
        idx += 1
