Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the first and second elements of `list_divisors`. Therefore, after execution, the values of `a` and `b` will be swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are swapped based on their values**
