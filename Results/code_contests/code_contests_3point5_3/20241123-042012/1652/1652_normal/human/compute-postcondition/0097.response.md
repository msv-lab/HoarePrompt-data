Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements of the list `list_divisors`. Since `list_divisors` contains integers parsed from the input line, `a` and `b` will now hold the first two divisors. The variables `nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 2, `a` is the first divisor, `b` is the second divisor**
