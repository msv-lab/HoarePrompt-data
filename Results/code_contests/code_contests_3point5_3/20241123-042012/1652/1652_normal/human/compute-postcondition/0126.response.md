According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `list_divisors` needs to be accessed. 

State: **`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2**
