Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are swapped based on their values, `d` is the third element in list_divisors. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `a`, `b`, `nb_test`, and `idx`.**
