Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is not provided in the initial state, so the final value of `b` is dependent on the value of `d` in the program execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, `a` remains the same, and `b` is assigned the value of `d` during execution.
Output State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, `a` remains the same, and `b` is assigned the value of `d` during execution**
