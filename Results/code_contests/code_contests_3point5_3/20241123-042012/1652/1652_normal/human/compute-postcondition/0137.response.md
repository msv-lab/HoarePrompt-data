Output State: 
- If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, the loop will not execute and `a` and `b` will remain unchanged.
- If the loop executes, after each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions within the loop, ensuring that `a` holds the smaller value and `b` holds the larger value. The values of `a` and `b` are dependent on the divisibility of the current `d` by `a` and `b`. `nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
- The final values of `a` and `b` after the loop completes will be determined by the divisibility conditions in the loop.
