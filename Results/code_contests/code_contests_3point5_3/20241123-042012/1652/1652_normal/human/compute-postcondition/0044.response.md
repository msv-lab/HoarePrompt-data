According to the code, the loop execution depends on the elements of `list_divisors`. If there are at least 3 elements in `list_divisors`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, and `a` and `b` may have been updated based on the conditions. To execute the loop one more time, the `list_divisors` must have at least 4 elements. 
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` may have been updated, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements**
