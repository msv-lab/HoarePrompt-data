Postcondition: ***`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. `a` and `b` are divisors from the list. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After the execution, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `a` and `b`. The list_divisors has at least 3 elements.***
