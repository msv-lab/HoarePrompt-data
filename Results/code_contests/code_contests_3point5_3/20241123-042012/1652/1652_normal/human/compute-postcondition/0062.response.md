Output State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. `a` is the second divisor from the list if `d` is divisible by `a`, otherwise, `a` retains its original value. `b` is equal to `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, otherwise, `b` remains the first divisor from the list. The list_divisors has at least 3 elements. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is either divisible by `b` or `a` based on the conditions met during the execution of the if else block.**
