Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions specified, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. In all cases, the initial values of `nb_test`, `idx`, and the elements of `list_divisors` remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
