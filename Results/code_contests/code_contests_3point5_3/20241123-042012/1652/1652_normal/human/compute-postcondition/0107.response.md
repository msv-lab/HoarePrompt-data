Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 2, `d` is the third element in list_divisors starting from index 2. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. In all other cases, the variables remain unchanged.***
