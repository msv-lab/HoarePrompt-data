Postcondition: ***nb_test and idx are both 1, a is the value of d, b is the first divisor from the list, list_divisors has at least 3 elements. The value of d is less than b, d is greater than or equal to a, and d is divisible by a. If d is divisible by a, then a is updated to d. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
