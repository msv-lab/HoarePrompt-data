Postcondition: ***`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. `a` and `b` are divisors from the list. `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to have the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to have the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged. After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above, ensuring the correctness of the divisors for further processing.***
