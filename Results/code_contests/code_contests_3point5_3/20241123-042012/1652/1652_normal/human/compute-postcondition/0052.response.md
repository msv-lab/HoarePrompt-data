Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are the first and second divisors from the list respectively, the output state after execution is: `nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, `a` is the second divisor from the list, `b` is the first divisor from the list.
Output State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, `a` is the second divisor from the list, `b` is the first divisor from the list**
