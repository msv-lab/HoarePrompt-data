According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from the standard input `sys.stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. To execute the loop one more time, no specific adjustments need to be made to `nb_test` and `idx`. 
State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1**
