Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`, but the initial value of `d` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` is updated based on the conditions specified, `b` is updated based on the conditions specified, list_divisors has at least 4 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` is updated based on the conditions specified, `b` is updated based on the conditions specified, list_divisors has at least 4 elements**
