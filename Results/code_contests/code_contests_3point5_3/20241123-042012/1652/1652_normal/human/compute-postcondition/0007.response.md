According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_divisors. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, nb_test is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to nb_test is 0, idx is not 0, a and b are swapped based on their values, and d is the third element in list_divisors.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are swapped based on their values, `d` is the third element in list_divisors**
