Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2, `a` is the same as `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2, `a` is the same as `d`**
