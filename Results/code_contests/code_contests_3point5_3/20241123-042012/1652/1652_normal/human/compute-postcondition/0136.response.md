According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. Check if there are more elements in `list_divisors` after the current index.
2. Update `nb_test` and `idx` accordingly based on the next element in `list_divisors`.
3. Apply the conditions mentioned in the description to update `a` and `b` if necessary and swap them if needed.

State: **`nb_test` is updated based on the condition, `idx` is updated based on the next index, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors`.**
