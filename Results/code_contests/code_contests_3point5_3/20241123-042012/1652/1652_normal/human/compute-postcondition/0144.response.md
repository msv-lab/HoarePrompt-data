Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the standard input and processes a list of divisors. If the index `idx` is not 0, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the list and updates the values of `a` and `b` accordingly. The updated values of `a` and `b` are then outputted to the standard output. If the list of divisors has less than 3 elements, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is not specified.**
