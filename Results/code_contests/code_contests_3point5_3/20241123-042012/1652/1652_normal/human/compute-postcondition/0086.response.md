Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and the value of `d` is unknown since it is not provided in the initial state. The values of `nb_test` and `idx` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, `a` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, `a` is assigned the value of `d`**
