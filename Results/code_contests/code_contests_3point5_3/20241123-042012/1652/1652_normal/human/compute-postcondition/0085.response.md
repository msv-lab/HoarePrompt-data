Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain unchanged. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are 1, they will remain unchanged as 1 is not greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1.
Output State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1**
