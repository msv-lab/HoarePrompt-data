Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` is updated based on the condition that `d % a == 0`, `b` remains unchanged, and `d` is the fourth element in list_divisors. If the condition `d % a == 0` holds true, `a` is updated to the value of `d`. In all other cases, no changes are made to the variables `a`, `b`, or `d`.***
