Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of the fourth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. Since `idx` is 3, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors` at index 5. Therefore, `a` is assigned the value of `d`, and the output state is: `nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2, `a` is the fourth element in `list_divisors` at index 5.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2, `a` is the fourth element in `list_divisors` at index 5**
