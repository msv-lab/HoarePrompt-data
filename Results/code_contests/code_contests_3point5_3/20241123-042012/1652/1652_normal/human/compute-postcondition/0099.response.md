According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list_divisors has at least 3 elements. Since the loop is starting from index 2, it implies that there are at least 3 elements in the list. Before the loop starts, `nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 2, and values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `d` is the third element in the list_divisors starting from index 2.
State: **`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 2, `d` is the third element in list_divisors starting from index 2**
