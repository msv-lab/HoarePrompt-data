According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_divisors. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on certain conditions. To execute the loop one more time, the list must have at least 4 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions specified, list_divisors has at least 4 elements**
