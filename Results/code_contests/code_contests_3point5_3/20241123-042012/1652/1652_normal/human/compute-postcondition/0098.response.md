Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` are not provided, so we cannot determine the final values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 2, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 2, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`**
