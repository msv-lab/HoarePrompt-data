Postcondition: ***`nb_test` and `idx` are both 0. If idx is not equal to 0, the list_divisors is mapped to integers and `a` and `b` are initialized with the first two values. `a` and `b` are then updated based on the conditions specified in the loop. If the list_divisors has less than 3 elements, `a` and `b` will remain swapped based on their initial values. The values of `a` and `b` after the loop will be printed. The postcondition covers the scenarios where `d` is divisible by `b`, `d` is divisible by `a`, and `d` is between `a` and `b` and divisible by `a`.***
