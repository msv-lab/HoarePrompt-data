According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_divisors and the conditions specified for updating `a` and `b` based on the value of `d`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` have been swapped based on the conditions specified, and `d` is the third element in list_divisors. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `d` is the fourth element in list_divisors, then `d` needs to be updated to the fourth element in the list.
- The conditions specified for updating `a` and `b` based on the value of `d` need to be checked and adjusted accordingly.

State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions specified, `d` is the fourth element in list_divisors**
