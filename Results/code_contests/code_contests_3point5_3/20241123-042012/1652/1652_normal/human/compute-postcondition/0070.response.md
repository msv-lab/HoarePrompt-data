According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_divisors. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. `a` and `b` are divisors from the list. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After the execution, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `a` and `b`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. `a` and `b` are divisors from the list. `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements**
