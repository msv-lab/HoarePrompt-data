Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. The initial value of `d` is unknown due to the lack of information about `list_divisors`. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. `b` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2, `b` is assigned the value of `d`**
