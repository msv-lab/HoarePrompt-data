Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` can be any value. Therefore, after execution, `a` will be equal to `d`. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. Updated values of `a` and `b` are based on the conditions mentioned above after processing the next element `d` in `list_divisors`.**
