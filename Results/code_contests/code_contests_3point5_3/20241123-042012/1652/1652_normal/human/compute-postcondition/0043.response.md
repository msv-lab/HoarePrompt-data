Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` may be updated based on the conditions specified. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all cases, the initial values of `nb_test`, `idx`, and the elements of `list_divisors` remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
