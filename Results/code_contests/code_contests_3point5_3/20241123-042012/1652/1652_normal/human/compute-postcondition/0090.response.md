According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. After processing the next element `d` in `list_divisors`, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions mentioned. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. If the value of `d` satisfies the condition `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` should be updated to the value of `d`.
2. If the above condition is not met but `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` should be updated to the value of `d`.
3. After these updates, the variables `a` and `b` should be swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.
4. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` should be updated to the value of `d`.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, variables `a` and `b` have been updated based on the conditions mentioned above after processing the next element in `list_divisors`**
