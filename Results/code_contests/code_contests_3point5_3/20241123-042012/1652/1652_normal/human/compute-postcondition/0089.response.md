Postcondition: ***`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. After processing the next element `d` in `list_divisors`, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If the first condition is not met but `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. After these updates, the variables `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of `a` and `b`.***
