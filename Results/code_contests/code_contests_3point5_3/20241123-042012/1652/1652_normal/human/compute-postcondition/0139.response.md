Postcondition: ***`nb_test` and `idx` are both 2, the list of divisors has at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` are integers that may have been updated within the loop. After the if-else block executes, `a` and `b` hold the updated values based on the divisibility conditions. The values of `a` and `b` are determined by iterating through the list of divisors. If a divisor `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. Subsequently, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped based on their magnitudes. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but less than `b`, and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. Finally, the output is printed as `%d %d` where `a` and `b` are the final updated values after the loop executes.***
