According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `list_divisors` starting from index 2. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 2, and `d` is the third element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to be the fourth element in `list_divisors`. Hence, the index `idx` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2**
