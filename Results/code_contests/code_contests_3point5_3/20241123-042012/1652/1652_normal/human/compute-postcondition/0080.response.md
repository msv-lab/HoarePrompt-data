According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements remaining in the list_divisors starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, `a` and `b` are divisors from the list, and `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `d` in `list_divisors` needs to be considered. Based on the conditions mentioned:
1. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to have the value of `d`.
2. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to have the value of `d`.
3. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`.

If none of the above conditions are met, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1. Updated values of `a` and `b` based on the conditions mentioned above after processing the next element `d` in `list_divisors`.**
