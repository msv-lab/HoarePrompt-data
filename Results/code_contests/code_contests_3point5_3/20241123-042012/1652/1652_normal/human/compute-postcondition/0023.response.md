Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are swapped based on their values, `d` is the third element in list_divisors. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, but `d` is not divisible by `b` and is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and neither of the conditions is met, then no changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. If none of the above conditions are met, no changes are made to `a` or `b`.***
