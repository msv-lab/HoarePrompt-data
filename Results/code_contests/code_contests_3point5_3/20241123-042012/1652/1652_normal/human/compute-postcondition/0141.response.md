According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from `sys.stdin`. At the end of the previous iteration, `nb_test` and `idx` are both 2, the list of divisors has at least 3 elements, and `a` and `b` have been updated within the loop based on the divisibility conditions. After the if-else block executes, `a` and `b` hold the updated values. The values of `a` and `b` are determined by iterating through the list of divisors.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `nb_test` and `idx` need to be incremented to 3.
2. The list of divisors needs to remain unchanged with at least 3 elements.
3. The values of `a` and `b` after the if-else block should reflect the final updated values after the previous iteration.
4. The values of `a` and `b` need to be swapped based on their magnitudes.
5. The output should be printed as `%d %d` where `a` and `b` are the final updated values.
State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 3, the list of divisors has at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` hold the final updated values, values of `a` and `b` are swapped, output printed as `%d %d`**
