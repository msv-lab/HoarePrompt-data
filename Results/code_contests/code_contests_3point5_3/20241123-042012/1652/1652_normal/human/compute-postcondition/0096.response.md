Example Answer:
The `list_divisors` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input line to an integer. The `line` is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a string containing space-separated integers. Therefore, after execution, the `list_divisors` will contain integers parsed from the input line. The values of `nb_test` and `idx` are not affected by this code snippet. The values of `a` and `b` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so they remain unchanged.
Output State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 2, the list of divisors contains integers parsed from the input line, values of `a` and `b` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop**
