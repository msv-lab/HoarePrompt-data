Output State: 
- If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, `a` and `b` will remain unchanged.
- If the loop executes, `a` and `b` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop to hold the smaller and larger values respectively. The final values of `a` and `b` after the loop completes will be determined by the divisibility conditions in the loop.
- `nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
- The output will be the values of `a` and `b` printed using `sys.stdout.write('%d %d\n' % (a, b))`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` will hold the updated values based on the divisibility conditions in the loop.**
