According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input available from the standard input (sys.stdin). Since sys.stdin is typically an open file object, the loop will execute as long as there is input to read. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nb_test` and `idx` do not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the availability of input from sys.stdin.

State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0**
