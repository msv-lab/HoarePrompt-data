Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions specified. If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d >= b` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Subsequently, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If none of the conditions are met, `a`, `b`, and `d` remain unchanged.***
