Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
