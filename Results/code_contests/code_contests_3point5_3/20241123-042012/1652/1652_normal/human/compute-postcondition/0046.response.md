Output State: **The loop will update the values of `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` will be updated to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` will be updated to `d`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` will be updated to `d`. If the list_divisors has less than 3 elements, `a` and `b` will remain swapped based on their initial values, and `nb_test` and `idx` will remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` after the loop will be printed using `sys.stdout.write('%d %d\n' % (a, b))`.**
