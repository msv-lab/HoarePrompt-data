Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` is assigned the value of `d`, `b` is swapped based on their values, `d` is the third element in list_divisors, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `a`, `b`, `nb_test`, and `idx`.***
