Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of `list_divisors` respectively. The initial state of `list_divisors` indicates it is filled with integers parsed from the input line. Therefore, the values of `a` and `b` are based on the first and second elements of `list_divisors`. The initial state of `nb_test` being 0 and `idx` being not 0 are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the first and second elements of `list_divisors`**
