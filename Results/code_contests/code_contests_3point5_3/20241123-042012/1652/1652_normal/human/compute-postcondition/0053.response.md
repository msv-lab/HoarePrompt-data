According to the code, the loop can execute if the list_divisors has at least 3 elements. Since the loop starts from the third element onwards, the list must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: 
State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 1, `a` is the second divisor from the list, `b` is the first divisor from the list, list_divisors has at least 3 elements**
