According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input received from `sys.stdin`. Since there is no specific condition mentioned in the code snippet, we will focus on the states given at the end of the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` and `idx` are both 2. If idx is not equal to 0, the program processes the list of divisors. If the list has less than 3 elements, the values of `a` and `b` remain the same.

To determine the states needed to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. Since `nb_test` and `idx` are both 2, which means they meet the condition for the loop to continue.
2. If the list of divisors has at least 3 elements, it will trigger the loop to execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be updated as follows:
State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are both 2, the list of divisors has at least 3 elements, values of `a` and `b` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop**
