Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by either `a` or `b`, no changes are made to the variables. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables. After the execution of the if else block, the variables `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, ensuring that `a` holds the smaller value, and `b` holds the larger value.***
