Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 2, `idx` is 3, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d >= b` and `d % b != 0`, but `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. The variables `a` and `b` are then swapped if `a` was greater than `b`. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, `a` retains its original value.***
