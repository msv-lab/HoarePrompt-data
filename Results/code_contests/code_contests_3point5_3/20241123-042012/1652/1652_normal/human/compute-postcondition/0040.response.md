Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and the previous value of `d` is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` is updated based on the conditions specified, `b` is updated based on the conditions specified, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `a` is updated based on the conditions specified, `b` is updated based on the conditions specified, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements**
