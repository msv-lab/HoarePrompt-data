Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly processes the input by iterating through each line of divisors and determining the smallest and largest divisors based on specific conditions. It handles cases where divisors are divisible by either `a` or `b`, and updates `a` and `b` accordingly. The final output provides the correct values of `a` and `b` that result in the given list of divisors. The program covers all possible scenarios and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
