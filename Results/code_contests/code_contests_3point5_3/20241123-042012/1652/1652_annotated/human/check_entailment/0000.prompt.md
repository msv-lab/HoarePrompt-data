You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently you have received two positive integer numbers x and y. You forgot them, but you remembered a shuffled list containing all divisors of x (including 1 and x) and all divisors of y (including 1 and y). If d is a divisor of both numbers x and y at the same time, there are two occurrences of d in the list.

For example, if x=4 and y=6 then the given list can be any permutation of the list [1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6]. Some of the possible lists are: [1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2], [4, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2] or [1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2].

Your problem is to restore suitable positive integer numbers x and y that would yield the same list of divisors (possibly in different order).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i.e. the given list of divisors corresponds to some positive integers x and y.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 128) — the number of divisors of x and y.

The second line of the input contains n integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^4), where d_i is either divisor of x or divisor of y. If a number is divisor of both numbers x and y then there are two copies of this number in the list.

Output

Print two positive integer numbers x and y — such numbers that merged list of their divisors is the permutation of the given list of integers. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    nb_test = 0
    idx = 0
    for line in sys.stdin:
        if idx != 0:
            list_divisors = map(int, line.strip().split(' '))
            a, b = list_divisors[0], list_divisors[1]
            a, b = (b, a) if a > b else (a, b)
            for d in list_divisors[2:]:
                if d >= b:
                    if d % b == 0:
                        b = d
                    elif d % a == 0:
                        a = d
                    a, b = (b, a) if a > b else (a, b)
                elif d >= a:
                    if d % a == 0:
                        a = d
            sys.stdout.write('%d %d\n' % (a, b))
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: 
    #`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated by adding 1 after each iteration. If there is input available in `sys.stdin` and `idx` is not 0, the loop processes each line by splitting it into a list of divisors. The variables `a` and `b` are initialized with the first two elements of the list in increasing order. As the loop iterates through the divisors, `a` and `b` are updated based on divisibility conditions and comparisons with the divisor `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. In cases where `d` is between `a` and `b`, and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After processing all divisors, `a` and `b` hold the smallest and largest values from the list, considering all possible divisibility conditions and comparisons. The final values of `a` and `b` are printed in the format '%d %d\n' to `sys.stdout`.
    #
    #If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute, and `a` and `b` retain their initial values. In such cases, no output is written to `sys.stdout`.
    #
    #If `idx` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `nb_test` as 0 and `idx` as 1 without any modifications to other variables.
    #
    #Overall, the loop processes each test case to determine the smallest and largest divisors based on specific conditions and updates `a` and `b` accordingly. The final output provides the values of `a` and `b` after processing all divisors.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
