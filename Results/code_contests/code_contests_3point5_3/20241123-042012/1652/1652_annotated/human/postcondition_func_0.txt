The function does not accept any parameters. It reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes each line as a list of divisors. For each line, it determines the smallest and largest divisors based on specific conditions and outputs them to `sys.stdout`. If the input list of divisors has less than 3 elements, no output is generated. The function operates under the constraint that the input integer values represent positive divisors of x or y, with two occurrences of each common divisor in the list.
