Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1. `idx` is updated. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Subsequently, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. If `d` is less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a`, no changes occur to `a` or `b` but `d` remains as the third element in `list_divisors`.***
