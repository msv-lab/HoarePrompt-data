Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, where `d` is the third element in `list_divisors` and greater than or equal to `b`. The value of `d` is divisible by `b`. Therefore, after execution, `b` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` is updated based on processing of the next test case, `b` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors` and greater than or equal to `b`, and the value of `d` is divisible by `b`**
