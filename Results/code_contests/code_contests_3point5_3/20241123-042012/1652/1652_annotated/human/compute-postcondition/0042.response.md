Postcondition: ***`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers obtained from input. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
