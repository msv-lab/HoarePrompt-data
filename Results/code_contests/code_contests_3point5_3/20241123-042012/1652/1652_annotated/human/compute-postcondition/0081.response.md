Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, but the previous value of `d` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `b` is assigned the value of `d`**
