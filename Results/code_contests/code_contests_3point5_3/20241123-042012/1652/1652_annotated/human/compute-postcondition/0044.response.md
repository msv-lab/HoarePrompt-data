According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more than 2 elements left in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, and `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers. To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `list_divisors` has at least 6 integers. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 6 integers**
