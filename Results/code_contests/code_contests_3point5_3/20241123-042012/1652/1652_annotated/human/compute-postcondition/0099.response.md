According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. The loop starts iterating from the third element of `list_divisors`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute:
State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`**
