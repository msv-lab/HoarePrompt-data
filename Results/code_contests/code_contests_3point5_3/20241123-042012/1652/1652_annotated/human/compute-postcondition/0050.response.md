Example Answer:
`list_divisors` is assigned the result of mapping `int` to the elements of `line.strip().split(' ')`. The values of `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on processing of next test case.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on processing of next test case**
