Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case. If the loop does not execute, then `a` and `b` will retain their values before the loop started. `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. The variables `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions in the loop. If no updates occur, `a` and `b` will maintain their initial values. The final output is printed as `%d %d\n` with the updated values of `a` and `b`. The loop handles various cases such as updating `a` and `b` if the divisor is greater than or equal to the current values, checking for divisibility by `a` and `b`, and swapping `a` and `b` based on their values.***
