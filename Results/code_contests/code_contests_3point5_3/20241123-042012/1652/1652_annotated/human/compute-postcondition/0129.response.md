Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` is assigned the value of `d` if `d % a == 0`, `b` is updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` that satisfies the mentioned conditions. If `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Overall, the program state is maintained with the given conditions after the execution of the if statement.***
