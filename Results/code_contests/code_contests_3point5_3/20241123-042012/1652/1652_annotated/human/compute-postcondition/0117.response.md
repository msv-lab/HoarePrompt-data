Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element of `list_divisors`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`**
