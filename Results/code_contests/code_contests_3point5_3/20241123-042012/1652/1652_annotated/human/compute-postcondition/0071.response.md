Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `b` is updated with the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `b` is updated with the value of `d`**
