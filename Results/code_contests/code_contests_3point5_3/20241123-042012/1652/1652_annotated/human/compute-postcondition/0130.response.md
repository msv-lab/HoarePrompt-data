Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` that satisfies the mentioned conditions. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d % a == 0`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The program state is maintained with the specified conditions after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring all edge cases are covered.***
