Postcondition: ***`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers obtained from input. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to be equal to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. In any other case, no changes are made to `a` or `b`.***
