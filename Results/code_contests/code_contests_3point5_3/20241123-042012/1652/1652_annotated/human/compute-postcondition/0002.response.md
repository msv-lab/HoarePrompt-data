According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines being read from the `sys.stdin`. Since `sys.stdin` is a stream of input, the loop will execute indefinitely until there is no more input to read. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the adjustment needed is that there is input available in `sys.stdin`. 
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`**
