Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1. `idx` is updated. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. `b` is updated based on processing of the next test case. `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
