The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates under the constraints that n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128. The list of divisors contains n integers where each integer d_i is a positive divisor of x or y, and there are two occurrences of each common divisor in the list.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that n is an integer between 2 and 128. The list of divisors contains n integers where each integer d_i is a positive divisor of x or y, with two occurrences of each common divisor in the list.**
