According to the code, the loop can execute if `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. Before the loop starts, `nb_test` being 0 does not impact the loop execution, `idx` not being 0 also doesn't impact the loop. However, for the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements, `a` should be the smaller of the first two elements of `list_divisors`, `b` should be the larger of the first two elements of `list_divisors`, and `d` should iterate over the elements starting from the third element in `list_divisors`.

State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers obtained from input, `a` is the smaller of the first two elements of `list_divisors`, `b` is the larger of the first two elements of `list_divisors`**
