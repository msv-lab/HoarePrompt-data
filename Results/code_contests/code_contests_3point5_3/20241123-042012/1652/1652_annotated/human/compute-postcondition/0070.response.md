According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. If there are at least 4 elements in `list_divisors`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 1 and `idx` is updated. No changes occur to `nb_test` or `idx` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `list_divisors`, which should have at least 4 elements for the loop to continue.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements**
