Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, and the value of `d` is greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `(d % b == 0)` is false and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`.***
