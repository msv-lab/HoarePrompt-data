Postcondition: ***`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers obtained from input. If `a` and `b` are the first two elements of `list_divisors`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then after the execution of the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b` and remain the same if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `d` is greater or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than `a`, `a` is updated to `d`.***
