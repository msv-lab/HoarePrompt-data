According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_divisors` containing at least 4 integers. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers obtained from input. If `a` and `b` are the first two elements of `list_divisors`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b` and remain the same if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `d` is greater or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the `list_divisors` must contain at least 4 integers.
