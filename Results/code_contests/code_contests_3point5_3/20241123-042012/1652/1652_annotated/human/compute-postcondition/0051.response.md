Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the first element of `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of the second element of `list_divisors`. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the processing of the next test case, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on processing of the next test case.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on processing of the next test case**
