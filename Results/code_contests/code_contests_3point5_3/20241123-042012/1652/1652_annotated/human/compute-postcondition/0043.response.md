Postcondition: ***`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers obtained from input. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a` and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If none of these conditions are met, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Finally, the variables `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b` after the execution of the if-else block.***
