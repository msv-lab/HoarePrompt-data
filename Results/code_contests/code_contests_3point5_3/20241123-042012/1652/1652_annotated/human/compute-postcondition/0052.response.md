Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. The initial values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case. The output state after executing the code is `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on processing of the next test case.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on processing of the next test case**
