Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`. In the case where `d % b == 0`, `b` is updated to `d` and all other variables retain their initial values. If `d % b != 0` and `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d` and all other variables retain their initial values. If both `d % b != 0` and `d % a != 0`, all variables retain their initial values.***
