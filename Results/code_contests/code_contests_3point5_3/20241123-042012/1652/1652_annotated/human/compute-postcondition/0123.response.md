Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` is assigned the value of the fourth element `d` from `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. `b` is updated based on the processing of the next test case. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, `a` remains unchanged.***
