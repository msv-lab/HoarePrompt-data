Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. Subsequently, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `a` or `b`.***
