According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `list_divisors`. If `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, and `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. So for the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 5 elements.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements**
