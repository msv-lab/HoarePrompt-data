Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case. If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop iterates through the elements in `list_divisors`, updating `a` and `b` according to specific conditions. If a divisor `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After each update, `a` and `b` are swapped if necessary such that `a` is always less than or equal to `b`. If `d` is between `a` and `b`, and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. The final values of `a` and `b` are then printed.***
