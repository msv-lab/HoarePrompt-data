Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d >= b` and `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d`. In both cases, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b`. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
