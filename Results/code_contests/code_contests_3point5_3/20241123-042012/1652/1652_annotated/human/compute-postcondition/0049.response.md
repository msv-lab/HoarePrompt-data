According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input available in `sys.stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and there is input available in `sys.stdin`. Since `idx` is not 0, the list_divisors is processed with each divisor `d`, updating `a` and `b` based on divisibility conditions and comparisons with `d`. After processing all divisors, `a` and `b` will hold the smallest and largest values from list_divisors respectively. 

To execute the loop one more time, the input available in `sys.stdin` should still be there, and `nb_test` should be 1 to indicate that there is at least one test case to process. Additionally, `idx` should be updated based on the processing of the divisors and comparisons with `d`. The new state after processing one more iteration should reflect the updated values of `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` based on the processing of the next test case.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on processing of next test case**
