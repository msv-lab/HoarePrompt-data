Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`. If idx is not 0, the list_divisors is processed with each divisor d. Initially, a and b are assigned the first two elements of list_divisors in increasing order. During iteration, a and b are updated based on divisibility conditions and comparisons with d. After processing all divisors, a and b will hold the smallest and largest values from list_divisors respectively, considering all possible divisibility conditions and comparisons. The final output is written to sys.stdout in the format '%d %d'.***
