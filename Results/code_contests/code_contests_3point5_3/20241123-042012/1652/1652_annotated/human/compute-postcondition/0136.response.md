According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, and `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` that satisfies the mentioned conditions. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions need to be met based on the processing of the next test case:
1. If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to `d`.
2. If `d >= b` and `d % b != 0` but `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`.
3. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`.
4. Finally, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain unchanged.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` that satisfies the mentioned conditions**.
