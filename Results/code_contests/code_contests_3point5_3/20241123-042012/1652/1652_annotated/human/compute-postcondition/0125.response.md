Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`. If `d >= b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d >= b` and `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. Regardless of the conditions, `a` and `b` swap values if `a > b`. If `d >= b` is false but `d >= a` is true and `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.***
