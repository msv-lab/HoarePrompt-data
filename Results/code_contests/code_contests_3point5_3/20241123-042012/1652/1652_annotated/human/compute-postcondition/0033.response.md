Postcondition: ***`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers obtained from input. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to be equal to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. If none of these conditions are met and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, the variables `a` and `b` are swapped based on their values. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. In all other cases, no changes are made to the variables `a` or `b`.***
