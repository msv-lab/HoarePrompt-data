According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `d` in `list_divisors` must satisfy the conditions mentioned in the code:

1. If `d >= b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` should be updated to `d`.
2. If `d >= b` and `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` should be updated to `d`.
3. Regardless of the conditions, `a` and `b` should swap values if `a > b`.
4. If `d >= b` is false but `d >= a` is true and `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` should be updated to `d`.
5. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, in the next iteration, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` that satisfies the mentioned conditions**.
