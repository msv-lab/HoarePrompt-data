According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. If there are at least 6 elements in `list_divisors`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, and `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 6 elements. 

No adjustments need to be made to `nb_test` or `idx`. 

State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 6 elements**
