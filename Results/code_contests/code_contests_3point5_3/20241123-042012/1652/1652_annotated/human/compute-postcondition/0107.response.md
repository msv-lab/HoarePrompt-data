Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors` and is greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If `d % b == 0`, `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d % b != 0` and `d % a == 0`, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. In all other cases, there are no changes to `a` and `b`.***
