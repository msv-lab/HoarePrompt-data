Example Answer: 
The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements of the list `list_divisors`. The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case. The variables `nb_test` remains 1, and `idx` is updated. Since the elements of `list_divisors` are used, the state of `list_divisors` changes. 
Output State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements**
