Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, but the values of `b` and `d` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers obtained from input**
