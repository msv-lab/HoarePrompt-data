Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` that satisfies the mentioned conditions. If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d >= b` and `d % b != 0` but `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Finally, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain unchanged.***
