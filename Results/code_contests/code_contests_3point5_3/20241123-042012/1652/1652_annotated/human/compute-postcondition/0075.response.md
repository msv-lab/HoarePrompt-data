Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In both cases, the variables `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` retain their initial values and requirements. `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b`.**
