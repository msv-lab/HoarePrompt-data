Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain the same. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the output state is: `nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements**
