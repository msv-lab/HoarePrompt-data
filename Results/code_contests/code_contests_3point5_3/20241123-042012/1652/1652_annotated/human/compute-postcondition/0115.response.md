Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, otherwise, `a` is assigned the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. Afterwards, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. `list_divisors` should have at least 3 elements, and `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`.***
