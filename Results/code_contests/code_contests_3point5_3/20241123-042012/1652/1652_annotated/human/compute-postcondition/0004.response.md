Example Answer:
The `list_divisors` variable is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input `line` by spaces. The `line` is read from `sys.stdin`, so the input is expected to be available. The values in the `list_divisors` are integers. The initial values of `nb_test` and `idx` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains integers obtained from input**
