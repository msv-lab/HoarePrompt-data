Postcondition: ***`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` is assigned the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`, `b` is updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`.***
