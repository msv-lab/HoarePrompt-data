Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. Since `a` is assigned the first element of `list_divisors` and `b` is assigned the second element of `list_divisors`, the output state will depend on the values of the first two elements of `list_divisors`. If the first element is greater than the second element, then `a` and `b` will be swapped, otherwise they will remain the same.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains integers obtained from input, `a` is either the smaller value of the first two elements of `list_divisors`, `b` is either the larger value of the first two elements of `list_divisors`**
