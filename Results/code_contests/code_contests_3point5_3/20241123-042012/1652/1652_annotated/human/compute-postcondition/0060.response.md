Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. `b` is updated based on processing of the next test case. `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to the value of `b`. The condition `(d % b == 0)` is false. The condition `(d % a == 0)` is true, and therefore `a` is assigned the value of `d`.***
