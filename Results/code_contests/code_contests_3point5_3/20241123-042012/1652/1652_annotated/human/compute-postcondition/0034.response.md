According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_divisors. If the list contains at least 5 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers obtained from input. This indicates that the list contains at least 4 elements, so it needs to be adjusted to contain at least 5 integers to execute the loop one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers obtained from input**
