According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. Since there is no specific condition mentioned in the code, the loop will continue as long as there is input from `sys.stdin`. At the end of the previous iteration, `nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated by adding 1, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case. `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `nb_test` remains 1
2. `idx` is updated by adding 1
3. `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case
4. `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements

No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements**
