Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers obtained from input, `a` and `b` are elements of `list_divisors`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`.***
