According to the code, the loop can execute again if `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, otherwise, `a` is assigned the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. Afterwards, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` should have at least 4 elements, and `d` should now be the fourth element of `list_divisors.
State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`**
