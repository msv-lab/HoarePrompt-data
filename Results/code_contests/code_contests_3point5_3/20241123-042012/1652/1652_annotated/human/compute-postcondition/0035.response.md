Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is not provided in the initial state, so the value of `b` remains unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`nb_test` equals 0, `idx` is not 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers obtained from input**
