Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is not given in the initial state, so the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is updated, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `d`**
