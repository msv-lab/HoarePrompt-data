Example Answer: 
The elements in `list_divisors` are updated by mapping `int` to each element in the input `line`. The initial state of `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` remains 1, `idx` is updated, `a` and `b` are updated based on the processing of the next test case, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements**
