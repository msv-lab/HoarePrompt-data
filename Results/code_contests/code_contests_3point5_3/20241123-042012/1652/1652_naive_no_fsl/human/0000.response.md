Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not correctly restore the suitable positive integer numbers x and y based on the given list of divisors. The logic in the program is flawed and does not handle all potential cases where the divisors may not be in the correct order to determine x and y.

An example where the program fails:
Input:
10
10 2 8 1 2 4 1 20 4 5

Expected Output:
20 8

The program may not produce the correct output for this input.
