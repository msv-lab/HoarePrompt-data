Example Answer:
The lambda function r takes input from the user and converts it into a map of integers. However, since the initial state does not mention any specific values for n, m, or ai, we cannot determine the exact impact on the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 100, and ai are integers such that -1000 <= ai <= 1000.**
