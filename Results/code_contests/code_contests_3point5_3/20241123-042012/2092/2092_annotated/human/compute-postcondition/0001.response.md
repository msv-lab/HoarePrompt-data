Example Answer:
The function r() returns two values which are assigned to variables a and b. The values of a and b are unknown as the function r() is not defined. Therefore, the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 100, and ai are integers such that -1000 <= ai <= 1000; a and b are assigned values returned by the function r().
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 100, and ai are integers such that -1000 <= ai <= 1000; a and b are assigned values returned by the function r()**
