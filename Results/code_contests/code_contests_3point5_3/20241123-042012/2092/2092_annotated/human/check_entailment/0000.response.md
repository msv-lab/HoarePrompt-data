Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement. It takes the input values, sorts the prices of the TV sets in ascending order, selects the first 'm' TV sets with the lowest prices, and then calculates the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn by taking the negative sum of those selected TV sets. This approach ensures that Bob maximizes his earnings by selecting the cheapest TV sets within the limit of 'm' TV sets he can carry. The program handles both positive and negative prices of the TV sets correctly. 
Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
