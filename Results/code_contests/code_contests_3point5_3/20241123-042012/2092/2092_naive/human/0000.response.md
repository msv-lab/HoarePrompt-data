Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes the input values for the number of TV sets and the number of TV sets Bob can carry. It then takes the prices of the TV sets as input, sorts them in ascending order, takes the first 'm' elements, and calculates the sum of these prices. Finally, it negates the sum to get the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the maximum sum of money Bob can earn by selecting the TV sets with the highest negative prices (as Bob is ready to pay for the TV sets with negative prices). It considers all possible cases where Bob can choose the TV sets with the highest negative prices within the limit of TV sets he can carry. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the logic implemented in the program, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases.
