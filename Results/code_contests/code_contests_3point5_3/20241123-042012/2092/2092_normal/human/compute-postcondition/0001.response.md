Example Answer:
The function r() returns two values and assigns them to variables a and b. The initial state does not provide the specific values of n and m, so we cannot determine the exact values of a and b. Therefore, the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, a and b are assigned values returned by the function r().
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, a and b are assigned values returned by the function r()**
