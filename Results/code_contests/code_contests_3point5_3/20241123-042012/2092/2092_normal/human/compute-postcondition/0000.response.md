Example Answer:
The lambda function `r` takes input from the user, splits it, and converts each element into an integer. The existing variables n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000. The lambda function does not directly affect the existing variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000**
