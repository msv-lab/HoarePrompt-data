The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of the first n integers starting from m, where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The function then returns the sum of these integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the sum of the first n integers starting from m.
