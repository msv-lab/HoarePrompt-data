Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values for the number of TV sets and the maximum number of TV sets Bob can carry.
- It then reads the prices of the TV sets, sorts them in ascending order, takes the first 'm' elements (as Bob can carry at most 'm' TV sets), calculates their sum, negates it (as some TV sets have negative prices), and prints the result.
- The code meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly calculating the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn by carrying at most 'm' TV sets.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases.
