Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The program does not split the total income `n` into parts and calculate the minimum tax amount as described in the problem statement. Instead, it checks if the input `n` is a prime number, and then outputs 1 if it is prime, 2 if it is even, and 3 otherwise.

The program does not handle the splitting of `n` into parts and calculating the minimum tax amount, which is the main requirement of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
