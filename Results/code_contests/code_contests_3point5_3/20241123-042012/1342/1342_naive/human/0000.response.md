Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible number of burles that mr. Funt has to pay as tax. The program only handles specific cases where the input number is a prime number or can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers. However, the problem description states that mr. Funt can split the income into multiple parts and pay the taxes separately. The program does not cover all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

For example, if the input is 27, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The optimal way to split 27 into parts to minimize the tax payment is (9 + 9 + 9), resulting in a tax payment of 3 burles.
