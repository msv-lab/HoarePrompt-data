The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` where n is greater than or equal to 2. It then iterates through a range from 2 to the square root of n plus 100 (exclusive) to check if n is divisible by any number i in that range where n is not equal to i. If such a divisor is found, the function returns False. If n is a prime number, the loop will not execute, and the function will return True. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine if the input integer `n` is a prime number, returning True if it is, and False otherwise.
