The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that n ≥ 2. After executing the function body, if n is divisible by any number i in the range from 2 to the square root of n + 100 (exclusive) and n is not equal to i, then the function returns False. If n is a prime number, the loop will not execute at all. If the condition is not met, the program returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` such that n ≥ 2, and return False if n is divisible by any number i in the specified range, otherwise return True.
