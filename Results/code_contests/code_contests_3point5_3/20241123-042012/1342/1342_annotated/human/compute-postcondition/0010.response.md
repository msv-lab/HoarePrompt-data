According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2 and `i` is one more than the previous value. If n is divisible by i and n is not equal to i, then the function returns False. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain unchanged unless the conditions for the return statement are met.
State: **`n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `i` is two more than the previous value**
