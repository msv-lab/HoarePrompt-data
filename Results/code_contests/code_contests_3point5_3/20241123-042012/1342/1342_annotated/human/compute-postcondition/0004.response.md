According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2. To execute one more time, the loop needs to increment `i` by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `i` is one more than the previous value**
