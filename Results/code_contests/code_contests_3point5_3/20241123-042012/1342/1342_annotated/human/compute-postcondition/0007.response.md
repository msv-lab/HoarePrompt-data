According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, and `i` is one more than the previous value. If n is divisible by i and n is not equal to i, then the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n` and `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1 and `n` should remain the same if the conditions for the loop to execute are not met in the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `i` is one more than the previous value**
