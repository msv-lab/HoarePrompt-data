According to the code, the loop can execute if the range specified is valid, which means the end value of the range is greater than the start value. In this case, the end value is calculated based on the square root of n plus 100. Therefore, the loop can execute if n is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `n` is already specified to be an integer between 2 and 2*10^9. Hence, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to the starting value of the range, which is 2.
State: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^9, `i` is 2**
