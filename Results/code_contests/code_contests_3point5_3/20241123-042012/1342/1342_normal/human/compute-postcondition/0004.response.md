According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `i` are integers. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, then the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` and `i` are integers, `i` is increased by 1**
