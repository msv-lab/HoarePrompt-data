According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, if `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, then the program returns False. In all other cases, there is no change in the state of the variables `n` and `i`, and no action is taken. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state of the variables `n` and `i` needs to be adjusted as follows:
- If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, then adjust `n` and `i` accordingly to satisfy the condition.
- If the condition mentioned above is not met, then no adjustment is needed.

State: **No adjustment needed if `n` is not divisible by `i` or `n` is equal to `i`. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, adjust `n` and `i` accordingly to satisfy the condition.**
