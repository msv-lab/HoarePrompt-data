The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^9. 
If `n` is a prime number, the loop will not return False. If `n` is not a prime number, the loop will return False if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n` + 100, excluding the square root itself. 
In Case 2, the program returns True. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and determine if it is a prime number or if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n` + 100 (excluding the square root itself). If `n` is a prime number, it does not return False; otherwise, it returns False unless it meets the conditions specified. If none of these conditions are met, the program returns True. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and based on certain conditions, it determines if n is a prime number or if it is divisible by specific numbers, returning False or True accordingly.**
