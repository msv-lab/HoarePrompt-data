According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, and the condition for the loop to execute again is `i` being less than the square root of `n` plus 100. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` and `i` are integers, `i` is increased by 1**
