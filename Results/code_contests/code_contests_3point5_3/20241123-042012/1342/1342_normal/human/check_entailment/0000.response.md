# Initial assessment:
The problem description states that Mr. Funt wants to split his total income `n` into multiple parts such that each part is greater than or equal to 2, and then pay taxes based on the maximum divisor of each part. The goal is to minimize the total tax paid by Mr. Funt. The conditions seem clear and the problem can be solved by checking the divisibility of `n` and `n-2` in specific cases.

# Code analysis:
The code provided consists of multiple functions for input handling and a main function `func_7` that reads the input value `n`, checks if it is a prime number, and then determines the minimum number of burles that Mr. Funt has to pay as tax. The code follows the logic of checking if `n` is prime, then if `n` is even, and finally if `n-2` is prime. The code outputs the minimum number of burles to be paid based on these conditions.

# Output hints:
The output hints describe the main function `func_7` and its logic well. They mention that the function checks if the input `n` is a prime number. If `n` is prime, the function returns 1 burle. If `n` is even, the function returns 2 burles. If `n-2` is prime, the function returns 2 burles. Otherwise, the function returns 3 burles.

# Decision:
The code seems to correctly implement the problem description and the output hints align with the code's logic. The conditions specified in the problem description are met by the code, as it handles the cases where `n` is prime, even, and `n-2` is prime to determine the minimum number of burles to be paid. Therefore, based on the initial assessment, code analysis, and output hints, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
