According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nodes[ind]`. If the list nodes[ind] has more elements to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the third element in the nodes[ind] list, res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52], [sosed, val], [sosed, val], [sosed, val], [sosed, val], [sosed, val], and [sosed, val] are appended to queue, Cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of 52, val is greater than HM, queue is not empty, val is 53, ind is assigned the value of cur[0], and [sosed, val] is appended to queue if res[sosed] is equal to 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, the sosed variable needs to point to the next element in the nodes[ind] list, and the necessary states should be adjusted accordingly:
State: **HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the next element in the nodes[ind] list, res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52], [sosed, val], [sosed, val], [sosed, val], [sosed, val], [sosed, val], and [sosed, val] are appended to queue, Cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of 52, val is greater than HM, queue is not empty, val is 53, ind is assigned the value of cur[0], and [sosed, val] is appended to queue if res[sosed] is equal to 0**
