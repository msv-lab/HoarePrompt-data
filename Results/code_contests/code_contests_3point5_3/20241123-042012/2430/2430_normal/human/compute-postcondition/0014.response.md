According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the elements in `nodes[ind]`. If there is at least one element in `nodes[ind]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `val` is 52, and `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `sosed` should be updated to the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and if the value at index `sosed` in `res` is 0, then a new list `[sosed, val]` should be appended to `queue`. If the value at index `sosed` in `res` is not 0, no action is taken.
State: **`HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]` where `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element**
