According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables queue, val, HM, res, and sosed. The loop will execute again if queue is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, HM is 51, val is 53, res[sosed] is equal to 0, res[ind] is assigned the value of val, and val is greater than HM. To execute the loop again, the queue must not be empty, res[sosed] must be equal to 0, and val must be greater than HM. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] and [sosed, val] are appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of val, val is greater than HM, and queue is not empty**
