According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the nodes[ind] list. If nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Additionally, if res[sosed] is equal to 0, and [sosed, 52] is appended to the queue, the loop can proceed. Before the loop starts, HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is each element in nodes[ind], and res[sosed] is 0. Also, cur is [sosed, 52], and res[ind] is assigned the value of val. If val is greater than HM, the program breaks. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is an element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of val, val is less than or equal to HM**
