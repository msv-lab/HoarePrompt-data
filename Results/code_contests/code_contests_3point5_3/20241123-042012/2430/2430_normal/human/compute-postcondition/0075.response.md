Postcondition: ***HM remains 51. The loop iterates over each element in res. If the value of res at the current index is greater than 26, it is updated to 2 * 26 - val. sosed represents each element in nodes[ind] where res[sosed] is equal to 0 and nodes[ind] has at least 1 element. If the loop continues, [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to the queue, and res[ind] is modified accordingly. If val becomes greater than HM at any point, the loop terminates. If nodes[ind] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], the loop does not run. If the maximum value in res is not greater than HM, the function returns the string resulting from converting the elements of res to characters based on the formula chr(26 - x + ord('A')) and joining them with spaces.***
