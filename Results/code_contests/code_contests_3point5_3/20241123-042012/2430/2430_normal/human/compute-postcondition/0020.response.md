According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list nodes[ind] and the condition res[sosed] == 0. At the end of the last iteration, HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], nodes[ind] has at least 1 element. If res[sosed] is equal to 0, then [sosed, 52] is appended to queue. In all cases, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue if res[sosed] is equal to 0. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in nodes[ind] needs to exist, and the condition res[sosed] == 0 needs to be satisfied. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is: sosed is the next element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, and res[sosed] is equal to 0.
State: **HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0**
