According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `nodes[ind]`. If there are more elements in nodes[ind], the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of val, val is less than or equal to HM. If res[sosed] equals 0, [sosed, val] is appended to queue. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next element in nodes[ind] needs to be available and the necessary conditions for the loop body to be executed need to be satisfied.
State: **HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of val, val is less than or equal to HM. If res[sosed] equals 0, [sosed, val] is appended to queue.**
