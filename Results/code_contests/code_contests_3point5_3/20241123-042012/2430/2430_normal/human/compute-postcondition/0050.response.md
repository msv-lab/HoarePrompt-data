According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nodes[ind] list being non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, the loop body is omitted. So for the loop to be executed the nodes[ind] list must have at least 1 element and sosed is the first element in the list.

State: **HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the first element in the nodes[ind] list, res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] and [sosed, val] are appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of 52, val is greater than HM, queue is not empty, val is 53, ind is assigned the value of cur[0]**
