The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. `n` is an integer representing the number of cities in Tree Land. `nodes` is a list of lists representing the connectivity of cities. Each sublist contains integers representing connected cities. Each city is numbered from 1 to n. 

The function iterates over each element in `res`. If the value of `res` at the current index is greater than 26, it is updated to 2 * 26 - val. `sosed` represents each element in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 and `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element. If the loop continues, `[sosed, 52]`, `[sosed, 53]`, `[sosed, 55]` are appended to the `queue`, and `res[ind]` is modified accordingly. If `val` becomes greater than `HM` at any point, the loop terminates. If `nodes[ind]` is empty or `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, the loop does not run. If the maximum value in `res` is not greater than `HM`, the function returns the string resulting from converting the elements of `res` to characters based on the formula `chr(26 - x + ord('A'))` and joining them with spaces.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. It updates the elements of `res` based on certain conditions and appends values to the queue. If a certain condition is met, the function terminates. If the maximum value in `res` is not greater than `HM`, it converts the elements of `res` to characters and returns them joined with spaces.**
