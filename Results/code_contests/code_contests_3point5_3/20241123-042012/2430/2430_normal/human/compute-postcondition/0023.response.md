The value of `cur` is assigned by popping the first element from the `queue`. Since the `queue` had [sosed, 52] appended to it, `cur` is assigned the value [sosed, 52]. The states of other variables remain the same. 

Output State: **HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52]**
