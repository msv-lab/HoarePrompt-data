Output State: **HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element. If res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue. If nodes[ind] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], the loop does not execute and no changes occur in the program state.**
