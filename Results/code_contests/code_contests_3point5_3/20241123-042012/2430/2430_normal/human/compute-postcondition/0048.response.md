Postcondition: ***HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] and [sosed, val] are appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of 52, val is greater than HM, queue is not empty, val is 52, ind is assigned the value of cur[0]. If val is greater than HM, the program breaks out of the loop.***
