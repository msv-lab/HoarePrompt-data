Example Answer:
`val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. The previous state of `res` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `val`. Therefore, the Output State is: HM remains 51, val is updated, sosed is updated based on nodes[2], [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue if the loop continues, res[1] is updated, maximum value in res is not greater than HM.
Output State: **HM remains 51, val is updated, sosed is updated based on nodes[2], [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue if the loop continues, res[1] is updated, maximum value in res is not greater than HM**
