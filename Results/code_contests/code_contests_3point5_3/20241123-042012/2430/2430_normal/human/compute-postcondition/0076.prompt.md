You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **n is an integer representing the number of cities in Tree Land. nodes is a list of lists representing the connectivity of cities. Each sublist contains integers representing connected cities. Each city is numbered from 1 to n.**
```
def func_1(queue, n, nodes):
```
Output: *HM remains 51. The loop iterates over each element in res. If the value of res at the current index is greater than 26, it is updated to 2 * 26 - val. sosed represents each element in nodes[ind] where res[sosed] is equal to 0 and nodes[ind] has at least 1 element. If the loop continues, [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to the queue, and res[ind] is modified accordingly. If val becomes greater than HM at any point, the loop terminates. If nodes[ind] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], the loop does not run. If the maximum value in res is not greater than HM, the function returns the string resulting from converting the elements of res to characters based on the formula chr(26 - x + ord('A')) and joining them with spaces.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
