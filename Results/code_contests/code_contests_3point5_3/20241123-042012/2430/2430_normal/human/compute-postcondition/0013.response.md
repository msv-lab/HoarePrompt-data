Postcondition: ***`HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]` where `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element. If the value at index `sosed` in `res` is 0, then a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`. If the value at index `sosed` in `res` is not 0, no action is taken.***
