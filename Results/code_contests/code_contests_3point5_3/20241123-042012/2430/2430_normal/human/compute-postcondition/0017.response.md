According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list and the condition `res[sosed] == 0`. If there is at least one more element in `nodes[ind]` and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]` where `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `nodes[ind]` needs to be identified, and if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, `[sosed, 52]` should be appended to the `queue`.

State: **`HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]` where `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, `[sosed, 52]` is appended to `queue` if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0**
