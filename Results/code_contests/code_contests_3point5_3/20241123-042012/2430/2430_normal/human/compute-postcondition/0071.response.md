According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `val`, `HM`, `res`, and `nodes`. At the end of the last iteration, HM remains 51, val is equal to the value of res at index 1, sosed is each element in nodes[2] where res[sosed] is equal to 0 and nodes[2] has at least 1 element. If the loop continues, [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue, and res[1] is updated accordingly. If val becomes greater than HM at any point, the loop breaks. If nodes[2] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[2], the loop does not execute. The maximum value in res is not greater than HM. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. Update val according to the new value of res at index 1.
2. Update sosed to be each element in nodes[2] where res[sosed] is equal to 0 and nodes[2] has at least 1 element.
3. Ensure that [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue if the loop continues.
4. Update res[1] accordingly.
5. Ensure that val does not become greater than HM at any point.

State: **HM remains 51, val is updated, sosed is updated based on nodes[2], [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue if the loop continues, res[1] is updated, maximum value in res is not greater than HM**
