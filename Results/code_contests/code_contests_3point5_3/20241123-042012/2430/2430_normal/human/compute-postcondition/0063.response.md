Output State: **After the loop executes, HM remains 51, val is incremented by 2 each time the loop runs, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0. If the loop continues, [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue, and res[ind] is updated accordingly. If val becomes greater than HM at any point, the loop breaks. If nodes[ind] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], the loop does not execute.**
