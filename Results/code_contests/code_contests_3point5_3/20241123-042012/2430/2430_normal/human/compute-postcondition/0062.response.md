According to the code, the loop can execute again if the queue is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the queue is not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop iterates through the elements in the list nodes[ind]. If the value of res[sosed] is 0, then [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. HM remains 51, val remains 53, sosed is the last element in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is 0, [sosed, 52], [sosed, val], and [sosed, val] are appended to queue. Cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is 52, val is greater than HM, queue is not empty, ind is assigned the value of cur[0]**.
