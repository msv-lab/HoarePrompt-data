According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `nodes[ind]` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `sosed` is the first element in the `nodes[ind]` list, and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0. Also, [sosed, 52], [sosed, val], and [sosed, val] are appended to the queue, and `cur` is [sosed, 52]. Additionally, `res[ind]` is assigned the value of 52, `val` is greater than `HM`, and `queue` is not empty. `val` is 53, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 after the if-else block is executed.

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the second element in the nodes[ind] list, res[sosed] is equal to 0. [sosed, 52], [sosed, val], and [sosed, val] are appended to queue. Cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of 52, val is greater than HM, queue is not empty, val is 53, ind is assigned the value of cur[0], and res[sosed] is equal to 0**
