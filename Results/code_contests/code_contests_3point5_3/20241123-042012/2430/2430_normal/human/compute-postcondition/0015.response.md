Example Answer:
A new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. The value of `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and the value of `val` is 52. Therefore, after execution, the `queue` will contain the appended element `[sosed, 52]`.
Output State: **`HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, `queue` contains `[sosed, 52]`**
