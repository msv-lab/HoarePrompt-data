Output State: **The loop iterates through the elements in the list nodes[ind]. If the value of res[sosed] is 0, then [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. HM remains 51, val remains 53, sosed is the last element in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is 0, [sosed, 52], [sosed, val], and [sosed, val] are appended to queue. Cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is 52, val is greater than HM, queue is not empty, ind is assigned the value of cur[0]. If nodes[ind] is empty, the loop does not execute.**
