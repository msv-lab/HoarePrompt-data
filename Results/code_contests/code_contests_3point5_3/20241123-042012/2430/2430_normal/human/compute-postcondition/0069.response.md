According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `res`, `ind`, `nodes`, `sosed`, `val`, `HM`. 

At the end of the last iteration, HM remains 51, val is equal to res[ind], sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0. If the loop continues, [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue, and res[ind] is updated accordingly. If val becomes greater than HM at any point, the loop breaks. If nodes[ind] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], the loop does not execute. The maximum value in res is not greater than HM. `ind` is 0 and `res` has at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `ind` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next index in `res`.
- The conditions related to `res`, `nodes`, `sosed`, `val`, `HM` should be checked and updated accordingly based on the loop body execution.
- The loop should only continue if the conditions specified are met, and the maximum value in res is still not greater than HM.

State: **HM remains 51, val is equal to res[ind+1], sosed is each element in nodes[ind+1] where nodes[ind+1] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0. If the loop continues, [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue, and res[ind+1] is updated accordingly. If val becomes greater than HM at any point, the loop breaks. If nodes[ind+1] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind+1], the loop does not execute. The maximum value in res is not greater than HM. `ind` is 1 and `res` has at least 1 element**
