According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `sosed` and the condition that `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given: HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] and [sosed, val] are appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of val, val is less than or equal to HM. If res[sosed] equals 0, [sosed, val] is appended to queue. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- Since `sosed` is the next element in nodes[ind], it should be updated to the next element in nodes[ind] after the current `sosed`.
- [sosed, 52] and [sosed, val] were appended to the queue, so the next elements should be appended to the queue accordingly.
- Cur should be updated to the new values for the next iteration.
- res[ind] should be updated to the new value for the next iteration.
- If res[sosed] equals 0, [sosed, val] should be appended to the queue again.

State: **HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] and [sosed, val] are appended to queue, cur is updated, res[ind] is assigned the value of val, val is less than or equal to HM, if res[sosed] equals 0, [sosed, val] is appended to queue again**
