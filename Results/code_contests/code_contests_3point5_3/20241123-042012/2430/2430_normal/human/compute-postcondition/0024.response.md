Example Answer:
`val` is assigned the value of the second element in `cur`, which is 52. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52].
Output State: **HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52]**
