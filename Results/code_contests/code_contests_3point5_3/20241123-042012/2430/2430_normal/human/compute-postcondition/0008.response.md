Postcondition: ***HM is 51. If val is greater than HM, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. This postcondition ensures that the program will either break when val exceeds HM or continue without any impact on the variables if val is less than or equal to HM.***
