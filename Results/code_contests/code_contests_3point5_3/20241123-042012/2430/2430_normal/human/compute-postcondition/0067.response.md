According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `res` list and the conditions specified for the loop. 

1. `res` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute.
2. The loop should continue as long as `val` does not become greater than `HM`.
3. For each iteration, `sosed` should be each element in `nodes[ind]` where `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.
4. If `nodes[ind]` is empty or `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, the loop will not execute.
5. The maximum value in `res` should not be greater than `HM`.

Based on the conditions, the initial state before the loop starts should be:
State: **HM remains 51, val is incremented by 2 each time the loop runs, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0. If the loop continues, [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue, and res[ind] is updated accordingly. If val becomes greater than HM at any point, the loop breaks. If nodes[ind] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], the loop does not execute. The maximum value in res is not greater than HM. `ind` is 0 and `res` has at least 1 element.**
