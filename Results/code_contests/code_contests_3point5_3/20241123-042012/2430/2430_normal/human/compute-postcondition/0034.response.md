According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `sosed`, `ind`, `nodes`, and `queue`. If there are more elements in `nodes[ind]`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `val` is 53, `sosed` is an element in `nodes[ind]` where `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, `[sosed, 52]` is appended to `queue`, `cur` is `[sosed, 52]`, `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`, and `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that the next element in `nodes[ind]` is selected as `sosed`.
State: **HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] is appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of val, val is less than or equal to HM**
