Output State: **After the loop executes, HM is 51, val is 53, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, 52] and [sosed, val] are appended to queue, cur is [sosed, 52], res[ind] is assigned the value of val. If val is greater than HM, the program breaks. If res[sosed] is not equal to 0, the loop does not execute.**
