According to the code, the loop can execute again if the queue is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the queue is not provided but we know that it will become non-empty after appending [sosed, 52] based on the conditions. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state of the program as follows:
State: **HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where nodes[ind] has at least 1 element and res[sosed] is equal to 0, and [sosed, 52] is appended to queue**.
