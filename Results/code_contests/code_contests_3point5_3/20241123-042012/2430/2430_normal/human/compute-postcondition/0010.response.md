According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nodes` at index `ind`. If there is at least one element in the list at that index, the loop will execute. Since we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, we need to adjust the state so that the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to set `nodes` at index `ind` to have at least one element, and then adjust the state to `HM is 51, val is 52, sosed is the first element in nodes[ind]`. 
State: **`HM` is 51, `val` is 52, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]` where `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element**
