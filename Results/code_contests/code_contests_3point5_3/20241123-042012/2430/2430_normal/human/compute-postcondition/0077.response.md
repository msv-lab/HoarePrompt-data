Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. It updates the elements of `res` based on certain conditions and appends values to the queue. The function terminates if the maximum value in `res` exceeds 51. If the maximum value in `res` is not greater than 51, it converts the elements of `res` to characters using the formula chr(26 - x + ord('A')) and joins them with spaces to return the resulting string. The function also ensures that the loop does not execute if nodes[ind] is empty or if res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind].**

In the provided annotated code, the functionality is accurately described based on the actual code.
