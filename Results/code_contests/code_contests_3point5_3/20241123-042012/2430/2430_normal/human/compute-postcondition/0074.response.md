Output State: **HM remains 51, val is the value of res at the current index, sosed is each element in nodes[ind] where res[sosed] is equal to 0 and nodes[ind] has at least 1 element. If the loop continues, [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue, and res[ind] is updated accordingly. If val becomes greater than HM at any point, the loop breaks. If nodes[ind] is empty or res[sosed] is not equal to 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], the loop does not execute. The maximum value in res is not greater than HM.**
