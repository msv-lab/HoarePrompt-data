According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `res` list and the maximum value in `res` not being greater than `HM`. At the end of the last iteration, HM remains 51, val is updated, sosed is updated based on nodes[2], [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue if the loop continues, res[1] is updated, and the maximum value in res is not greater than HM. 

To execute the loop one more time, the length of `res` should be such that there is at least one more iteration possible and the maximum value in `res` should still not be greater than HM. Additionally, any other variables that need to be updated based on the loop iteration should also be adjusted accordingly.

State: **HM remains 51, val is updated, sosed is updated based on nodes[2], [sosed, 52], [sosed, 53], [sosed, 55] are appended to queue if the loop continues, res[1] is updated, maximum value in res is not greater than HM, length of res allows for at least one more iteration**
