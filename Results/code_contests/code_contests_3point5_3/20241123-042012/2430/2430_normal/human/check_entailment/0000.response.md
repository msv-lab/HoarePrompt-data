Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code does not seem to follow the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` assigns ranks to the officers in the cities based on certain conditions, but there is a flaw in the logic that might lead to incorrect results. The termination condition of the loop in `func_1` is based on the value of `val` exceeding `HM`, which is calculated as `2 * 26 - 1`. This might not account for all possible cases and could lead to incorrect rankings assigned to the officers. Additionally, the way ranks are assigned based on the formula `chr(26 - x + ord('A'))` might not guarantee the correct ranking order.

Therefore, the code may not provide a valid plan as required by the problem description, and hence, the correctness is **False**.
