Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first reads the input which consists of the number of cities and the connections between them.
2. It then constructs a graph based on the connections provided.
3. It initializes a queue with cities that have only one connection and assigns rank 1 to them.
4. It then iterates through the queue, assigning ranks to connected cities such that the rank increases by 1 for each level.
5. If a city is assigned a rank greater than `2 * 26 - 1`, it breaks and returns "Impossible!".
6. Finally, it converts the ranks to characters from 'A' to 'Z' and returns the result.

The program follows the problem description by ensuring that on any path between two cities with officers of the same rank, there is a city with a higher-ranked officer. The logic of assigning ranks based on the rules described in the problem ensures a valid solution.
