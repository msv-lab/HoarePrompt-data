Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly assigns ranks to officers in each city based on the rules provided in the problem description. The program ensures that on the simple path between two cities with officers of the same rank, there will be a city with a higher ranked officer. It handles the tree structure of the cities correctly and assigns ranks accordingly. The program also checks for the possibility of a valid plan and outputs "Impossible!" if it is not possible. Since the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is true.
