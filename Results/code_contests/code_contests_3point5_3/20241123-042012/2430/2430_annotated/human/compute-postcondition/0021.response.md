Output State: **After the loop execution, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are continuously updated, `cur` retains the value at the front of the queue, `val` maintains the value of the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, and if `res[sosed]` is 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. If `val` becomes greater than `HM` at any point, the execution of the loop terminates. In the case where `res[sosed]` is not 0, the `queue` is not modified.**
