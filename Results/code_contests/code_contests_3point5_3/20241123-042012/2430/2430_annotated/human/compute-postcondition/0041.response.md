Output State: After the loop executes, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are continuously updated with `val` at index `ind`, `cur` is updated to the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the value of the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, and a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` if `res[sosed]` is 0. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the loop execution breaks without altering the other variables.
In case the loop does not execute due to `nodes[ind]` being empty or `val` being greater than `HM`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
