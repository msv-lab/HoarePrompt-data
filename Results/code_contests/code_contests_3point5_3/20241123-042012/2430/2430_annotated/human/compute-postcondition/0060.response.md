According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `sosed` iterating through the elements of `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `val` needs to be updated to the second element of `cur` + 2.
2. `ind` needs to be updated to the next element in `cur`.
3. `val` should still not be greater than `HM`.
4. `nodes[ind]` needs to remain non-empty.
5. For all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]` should still be 0.
6. The queue should be updated with [sosed, val].
7. `cur` needs to be updated.
8. `val` should be assigned the second element of `cur` + 2.
9. `res[ind]` should be assigned the value of `val`.
10. `val` should still not exceed `HM`.
11. `val` should be incremented by 1.
12. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then [sosed, val] should be appended to the queue.

State: **HM remains 51. res is continuously updated. val is updated to the second element of cur + 2, ind is the next element of cur. val is not greater than HM, nodes[ind] is non-empty. For all sosed in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is 0. The queue is updated with [sosed, val]. cur is updated, val is assigned the second element of cur + 2. res[ind] is assigned the value of val. Val does not exceed HM, val is incremented by 1. If res[sosed] is 0, then [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.**
