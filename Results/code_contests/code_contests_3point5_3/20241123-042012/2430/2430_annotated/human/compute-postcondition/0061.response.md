Output State: **HM remains 51. res is continuously updated with the values of val at index ind. val is updated to the second element of cur + 1. ind holds the value of the first element of cur. val is not greater than HM. nodes[ind] is iterated over, and if res[sosed] is 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. After the loop, res[ind] is assigned the value of val. If val exceeds HM, the loop breaks. val is incremented by 1.**

In cases where nodes[ind] is empty, the loop will not execute and no changes will occur to the variables.
