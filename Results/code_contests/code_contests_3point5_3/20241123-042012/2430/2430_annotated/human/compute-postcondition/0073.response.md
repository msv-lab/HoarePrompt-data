According to the code, the loop can execute again if `ind` is less than the length of the list `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list with at least 1 element, `cur` holds the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the second element of `cur` plus 1, `ind` stores the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, and if `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue, `ind` is updated to the next index, `val` is the element at index `ind` in the list `res`, `val` is the element at index `ind` in the list `res`, and `val` is assigned the value at index `ind` in the list `res`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be less than the length of `res`.
State: **`HM` is 51, `res` is a list with at least 1 element, `cur` holds the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the second element of `cur` plus 1, `ind` stores the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, and if `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue, `ind` is updated to the next index, `val` is the element at index `ind` in the list `res`, `val` is the element at index `ind` in the list `res`, and `val` is assigned the value at index `ind` in the list `res`, `ind` is less than the length of `res`**
