According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `val`, `ind`, `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]`, and the conditions related to them. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Update `val` to the value of the second element of `cur` + 1.
2. Update `ind` to be the first element of `cur`.
3. Ensure that `val` is not greater than `HM`.
4. Ensure that `nodes[ind]` is non-empty.
5. Make sure that `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`.
6. Update `queue` with `[sosed, val]`.
7. Update `cur`.
8. Assign the value of the second element of `cur` to `val`.
9. Assign the value of `val` to `res[ind]`.
10. Ensure that `val` does not exceed `HM`.
11. Increment `val` by 1.
12. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then append `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`.

State: **HM remains 51, res is continuously updated, val is updated to the second element of cur + 1, ind is the first element of cur, val is not greater than HM, nodes[ind] is non-empty, res[sosed] is 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], queue is updated with [sosed, val], cur is updated, val is assigned the second element of cur, res[ind] is assigned the value of val, val does not exceed HM, val is incremented by 1, and if res[sosed] is 0, then [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.**
