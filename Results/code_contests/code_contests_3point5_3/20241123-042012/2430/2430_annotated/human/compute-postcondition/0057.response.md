According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `ind` and the elements in `nodes`. If there are more elements in `nodes[ind]`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `val` has been updated to the second element of `cur`, `ind` is the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, and `nodes[ind]` is non-empty. For all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]` is 0. The queue is updated with `[sosed, val]` and `cur` is updated.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `val` should be incremented by 1.
- If `res[sosed]` is 0 for the next `sosed`, then `[sosed, val]` should be appended to the queue.

State: **HM remains 51, res is continuously updated. val is updated to the second element of cur + 1, ind is the first element of cur. val is not greater than HM, nodes[ind] is non-empty. For all sosed in nodes[ind], res[sosed] is 0. The queue is updated with [sosed, val]. cur is updated, val is assigned the second element of cur + 1. res[ind] is assigned the value of val. Val does not exceed HM, val is incremented by 1. If res[sosed] is 0, then [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.
