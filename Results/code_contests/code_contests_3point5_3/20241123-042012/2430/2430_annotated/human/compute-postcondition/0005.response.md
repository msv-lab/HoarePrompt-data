Example Answer:
The value of `res` at index `ind` is updated to `val`. The initial state mentions that the length of `res` is unknown, so the affected elements are not explicitly defined. The output state will reflect that the value at index `ind` of `res` is now equal to `val`.
Output State: **`HM` is 51, elements of `res` are updated based on the assignment, `cur` is the value at the front of the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`**
