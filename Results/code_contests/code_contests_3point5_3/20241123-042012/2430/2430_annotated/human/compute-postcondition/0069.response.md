According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `res` and the value of `ind`. If `ind` is less than the length of `res`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, HM is 51, res is a list with at least 1 element, cur holds the value at the front of the queue, val is updated to the second element of cur plus 1, ind stores the value of the first element of cur, val is not greater than HM, nodes[ind] is iterated over, and if res[sosed] is 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], [sosed, val] is appended to the queue, ind is 0, val is the element at index 'ind' in the list 'res'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, ind should be less than the length of `res` and updated accordingly.
State: **HM is 51, res is a list with at least 1 element, cur holds the value at the front of the queue, val is updated to the second element of cur plus 1, ind stores the value of the first element of cur, val is not greater than HM, nodes[ind] is iterated over, and if res[sosed] is 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], [sosed, val] is appended to the queue, ind is updated to the next index, val is the element at index 'ind' in the list 'res'**
