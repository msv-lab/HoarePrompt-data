Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. It operates by updating the `res` list based on the values in the `queue` and `nodes`. If the maximum value in `res` exceeds 51, the function returns 'Impossible!'. If there are elements in `res` greater than 26 after processing, they are replaced with 2 * 26 - `val`. The function also appends new values to `queue` based on specific conditions. The overall functionality includes handling undirected roads between cities represented by pairs of integers.**
