The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Each pair of integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) represents an undirected road between city a and city b. 

After executing the function body, the program checks if the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`. If it is, the program returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, the program iterates over `res`, updating values. If there are elements in `res` greater than 26 after the loop executes, they are replaced with 2 * 26 - val. 

If `res` is initially empty or `val` exceeds `HM`, the loop does not execute, and the initial state remains unchanged: `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown length. 

After the loop finishes, `HM` remains 51, `res` is continuously updated with the values of `val` at index `ind`, `cur` holds the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the second element of `cur` plus 1, `ind` stores the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, and if `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to perform the described operations on the input parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`, updating `res`, `HM`, and the queue based on the conditions specified.
