Postcondition: ***In the program fragment, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are continuously updated with `val` at index `ind`, `cur` is updated to the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the value of the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`, and the `queue` is not empty. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if statement.***
