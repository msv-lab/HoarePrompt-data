According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range of `res` has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, to ensure that the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **HM is 51, res is a list with at least 1 element, cur holds the value at the front of the queue, val is updated to the second element of cur plus 1, ind stores the value of the first element of cur, val is not greater than HM, nodes[ind] is iterated over, and if res[sosed] is 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], [sosed, val] is appended to the queue, ind is 0**
