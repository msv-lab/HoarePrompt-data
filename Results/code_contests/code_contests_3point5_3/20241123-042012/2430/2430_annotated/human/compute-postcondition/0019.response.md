Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are still updated, `cur` retains the value at the front of the queue, `val` maintains the value of the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` has remaining elements, `res[sosed]` is 0, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.***
