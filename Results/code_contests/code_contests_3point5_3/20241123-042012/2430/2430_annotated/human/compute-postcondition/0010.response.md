According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nodes`, `ind`, and `HM`. If the `nodes` list at index `ind` is not empty and `val` is not greater than `HM`, the loop can execute. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`HM` is 51, `elements of res are updated based on the assignment, `cur` is the value at the front of the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty**
