According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements in the list `nodes[ind]` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **After the if statement executes, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are continuously updated with `val` at index `ind`, `cur` is updated to the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the value of the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`, and if `res[sosed]` is 0, then a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue. **
