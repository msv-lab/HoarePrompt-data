According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `nodes[ind]` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are continuously updated, `cur`, `val`, `ind`, `nodes`, and the `queue` are updated based on certain conditions. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the key state that needs to be adjusted is the `nodes` list for the next iteration. Since the loop iterates over `nodes[ind]`, the `nodes` list should have more elements or `sosed` values for the next iteration.

State: **After the if statement executes, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are continuously updated with `val` at index `ind`, `cur` is updated to the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the value of the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`, and if `res[sosed]` is 0, then a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue. In addition, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` if `res[sosed]` is 0.**
