According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `nodes[ind]`. If the list `nodes[ind]` still has elements left to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are still updated based on the assignment, `cur` retains the value at the front of the queue, `val` maintains the value of the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is still not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is still not empty, `res[sosed]` is 0, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is if there are still elements in `nodes[ind]` to iterate over.
State: **After the execution of the if statement, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are still updated based on the assignment, `cur` retains the value at the front of the queue, `val` maintains the value of the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is still not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` has remaining elements, `res[sosed]` is 0, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
