According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `nodes[ind]` and the conditions specified. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

- Since the loop is iterating over `nodes[ind]`, the next iteration can proceed if there are still elements remaining in the list `nodes[ind]`.
- If `res[sosed]` is initially 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, this condition needs to be satisfied, which means `res[sosed]` should have been updated to a non-zero value during the previous iteration.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **After the execution of the if statement, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are still updated, `cur` retains the value at the front of the queue, `val` maintains the value of the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` has remaining elements, `res[sosed]` is not 0, and there is no new list `[sosed, val]` appended to the `queue`.**
