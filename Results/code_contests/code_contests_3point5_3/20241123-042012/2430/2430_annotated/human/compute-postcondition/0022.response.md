According to the code, the loop can execute again if the `queue` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions mentioned are as follows:
- `HM` remains 51
- `val` is not greater than `HM`
- `res[sosed]` is either 0 or not 0
- `nodes[ind]` is iterated over
- If `res[sosed]` is 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`
- If `val` becomes greater than `HM`, the loop terminates

Based on the given conditions, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `val` should not be greater than `HM`
- If `res[sosed]` is 0 and a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`, then the `queue` should not be empty

State: **`HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are continuously updated, `cur` retains the value at the front of the queue, `val` maintains the value of the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, and if `res[sosed]` is 0 and a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`, the `queue` is not empty.**
