According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of various variables. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `cur` should be updated to the value at the front of the queue.
2. `val` should be updated to the value of the second element of `cur` incremented by 1.
3. `ind` should hold the value of the first element of `cur`.
4. `val` should not be greater than `HM`.
5. `nodes[ind]` should be iterated over.
6. A new list `[sosed, val]` should be appended to the `queue`.
7. The `queue` should not be empty.
8. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then a new list `[sosed, val]` should be appended to the `queue`.
State: **`HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are continuously updated with `val` at index `ind`, `cur` is updated to the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the value of the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`, the `queue` is not empty, and if `res[sosed]` is 0, then a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue**.
