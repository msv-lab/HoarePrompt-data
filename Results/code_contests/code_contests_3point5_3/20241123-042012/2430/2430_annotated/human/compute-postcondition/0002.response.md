Example Answer: 
The value at the front of the queue is removed and assigned to `cur`. The length of `res` is unknown, so the impact on `res` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown length, and `cur` is the value at the front of the queue.
Output State: **`HM` is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown length, `cur` is the value at the front of the queue**
