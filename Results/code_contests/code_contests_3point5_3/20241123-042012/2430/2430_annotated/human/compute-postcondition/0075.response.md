Postcondition: ***If the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the program returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, after the loop executes, if there are elements in `res` greater than 26, they are replaced with 2 * 26 - val. The loop iterates over `res` updating values. If `res` is empty or `val` exceeds `HM`, the loop does not execute. In this case, the initial state remains unchanged: `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown length. After the loop finishes, `HM` remains 51, `res` is continuously updated with the values of `val` at index `ind`, `cur` holds the value at the front of the queue, `val` is updated to the second element of `cur` plus 1, `ind` stores the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is not greater than `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is iterated over, and if `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue.***
