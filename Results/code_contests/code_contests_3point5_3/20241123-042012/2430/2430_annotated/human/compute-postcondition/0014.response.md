According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions that `res[sosed]` is 0 and the value of `val` is not greater than `HM`. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are still updated based on the assignment, `cur` retains the value at the front of the queue, `val` maintains the value of the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is still not greater than `HM`, and `nodes[ind]` is still not empty. 

To execute the loop one more time, the condition `res[sosed]` must be 0, so a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `res[sosed]` to be 0.
State: **After the execution of the if statement, `HM` remains 51, elements of `res` are still updated based on the assignment, `cur` retains the value at the front of the queue, `val` maintains the value of the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` holds the value of the first element of `cur`, `val` is still not greater than `HM`, and `nodes[ind]` is still not empty, `res[sosed]` is 0**
