Example Answer:
A list `res` is created with `n` elements, each initialized to 0. However, the value of `n` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown length.
Output State: **`HM` is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown length**
