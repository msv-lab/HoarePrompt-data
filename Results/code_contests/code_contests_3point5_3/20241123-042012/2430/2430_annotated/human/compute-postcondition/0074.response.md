Output State: **After the loop executes, if res contains elements greater than 26, they will be replaced with 2 * 26 - val. The loop will iterate over the elements of res and update them accordingly. If res is empty, the loop will not execute. HM is 51, res is a list, cur holds the value at the front of the queue, val is the updated value, ind stores the current index being operated on, val is not greater than HM, nodes[ind] is iterated over, and if res[sosed] is 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.**
