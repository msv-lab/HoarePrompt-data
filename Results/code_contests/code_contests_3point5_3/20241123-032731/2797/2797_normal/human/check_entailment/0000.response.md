Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code initializes a 2D list `l` of size n x m with zeros. It then processes k queries as described in the problem statement. If the query is of the form (1, b, c), it updates the values in row b - 1 of `l` to c. If the query is of the form (2, b, c), it updates all elements in column b - 1 of `l` to c. The code prints the resulting 2D list `l` after processing all queries.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as considering potential cases, it seems that the code does indeed follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the functionality of the program. Therefore, the code is correct.
