Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the loop updates the values in the `m` columns of row `b - 1` in the 2D list `l` to `c`. If `m` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute. After the loop, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their initial integer values, and `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with the specified values updated. If `a` is not equal to 1, the loop updates the element at column index `b-1` in each row of the 2D list `l` to the value of `c`. All variables retain their initial values. The loop executes `n` times as long as `n` is at least 1; if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute.***
