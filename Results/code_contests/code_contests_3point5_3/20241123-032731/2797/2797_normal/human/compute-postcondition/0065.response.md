Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k - 1` are positive integers and `k` is greater than 1. `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is at least 1, then after the loop executes, the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l` will have all elements updated to `c` for each iteration of the loop. If `m` is less than 1, no changes are made to `l`. If `a` is not equal to 1 and `n` is greater than 0, after the loop executes, all elements in the `l` list at index `b - 1` are assigned the value `c`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.***
