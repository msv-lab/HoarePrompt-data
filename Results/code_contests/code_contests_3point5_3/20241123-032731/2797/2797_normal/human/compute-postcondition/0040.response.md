According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n, m, and k-1 are positive integers; a, b, and c retain the integers input by the user; l is a 2D list of size n x m with values updated according to the loop; a is not equal to 1; i is less than n + 2**
