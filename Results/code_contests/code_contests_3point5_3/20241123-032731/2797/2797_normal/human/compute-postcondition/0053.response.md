Example Answer:
The element at index `i + 1` of the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l` is updated to `c`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the variables are not directly mentioned, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting, the element at index `i + 1` of the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l` is updated to `c`, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting, the element at index `i + 1` of the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l` is updated to `c`, `i` is increased by 1**
