According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k-1` are positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user; `l` is a 2D list of size n x m with values updated according to the loop; `a` is not equal to 1; `i` is less than n + 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented and stays less than `n + 2`. Therefore, the state to adjust is `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k-1` are positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user; `l` is a 2D list of size n x m with values updated according to the loop; `a` is not equal to 1; `i` is less than n + 3**
