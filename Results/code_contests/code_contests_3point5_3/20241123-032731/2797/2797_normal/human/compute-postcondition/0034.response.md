Output State: **If `m` is greater than 0, the loop will update the values in the `m` columns of row `b - 1` in the 2D list `l` to `c`. If `m` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute. After the loop executes, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` remain positive integers, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user, and `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with the specified values updated.**
