Example Answer:
`k` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is one more than the current value, so after execution, `k` is decreased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers and `k` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers and `k` is greater than 1**
