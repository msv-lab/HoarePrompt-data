Example Answer: 
A 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n x m`, where each element is initialized to 0. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros**
