Example Answer: 
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input after splitting. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers and `k` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers and `k` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting**
