According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k-1` are positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with values updated according to the loop; `a` is not equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n, m, and k-1 are positive integers; a, b, and c retain the integers input by the user; l is a 2D list of size n x m with values updated according to the loop; a is not equal to 1; i is less than n + 1**
