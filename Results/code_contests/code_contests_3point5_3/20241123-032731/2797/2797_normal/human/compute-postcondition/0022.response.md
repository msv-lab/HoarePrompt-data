Output State: **After the loop executes, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with all elements in column `b - 1` assigned the value `c`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `l` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros; `k` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints.**
