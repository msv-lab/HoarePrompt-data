According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1; `l[i+1][b - 1]` is assigned the value `c`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `n` should be greater than `i + 1`
- `l[i+1][b - 1]` should be set to a value other than `c` to indicate that the loop can continue
- No other states need adjustment

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1; `l[i+1][b - 1]` is assigned a value other than `c`**
