According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1; `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value `c`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1; `l[i+1][b - 1]` is assigned the value `c`**
