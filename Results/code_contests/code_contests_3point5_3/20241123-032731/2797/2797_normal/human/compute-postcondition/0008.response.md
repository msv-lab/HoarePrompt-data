According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `l` is a 2D list of size n x m, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned integers input by the user, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is positive integer decremented by 1, `l` is a 2D list of size n x m, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned integers input by the user, `i` is 1**
