Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for integers n, m, and k. It initializes a 2D list l of size n x m with zeros. Then, it processes k queries based on the given constraints. If a query is of the form (1, b, c), it updates the values in row b - 1 of l to c. If the query is of the form (2, b, c), it updates all elements in column b - 1 of l to c. After processing all queries, the function prints the 2D list l in a formatted manner. The function does not explicitly return any value. If n, m, or k are 0, no updates are made to l.**
