According to the code, the loop will execute as long as m is at least 1. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted such that m is greater than or equal to 1 and i is initialized to 0.
State: **n, m is greater than or equal to 1, k is positive integer satisfying constraints and decremented by 1, l is a 2D list of size n x m filled with zeros, a is equal to 1, b and c are assigned integers input by the user after splitting, i is 0**
