According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers, `a`, `b + 1`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with values updated according to the loop, and `i` is `m - 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers, `a`, `b + 1`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with values updated according to the loop, `i` is `m`**
