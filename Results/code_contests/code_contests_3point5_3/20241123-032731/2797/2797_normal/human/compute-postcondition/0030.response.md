Example Answer:
The value of `c` is assigned to the element at index `b - 1` in the `i`-th column of the 2D list `l`. The indices are adjusted based on 0-indexing. Since `b` is `b + 1`, it should be adjusted to `b - 1` before updating the value. Therefore, the element at index `b - 1` in the `i`-th column of `l` is updated to the value of `c`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers, `a`, `b + 1`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with values updated according to the loop, `i + 1**.
