According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `m`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i is m - 1`.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers, `a`, `b + 1`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with values updated according to the loop, and `i` is `m - 1` where `l[b - 1][m]` is assigned the value `c**.
