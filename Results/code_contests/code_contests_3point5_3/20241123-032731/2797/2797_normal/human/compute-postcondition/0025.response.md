Example Answer:
The value of `k` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `k - 1` is unknown, so after execution, the updated value of `k` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with values updated according to the loop.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with values updated according to the loop**
