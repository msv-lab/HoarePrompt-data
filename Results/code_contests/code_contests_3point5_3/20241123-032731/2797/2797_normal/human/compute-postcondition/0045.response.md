According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers and `k` is greater than 1**
