According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k - 1` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 1, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting, `i` is 3, `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value `c`**
