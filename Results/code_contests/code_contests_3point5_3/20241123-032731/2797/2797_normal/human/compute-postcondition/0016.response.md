Example Answer:
The value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`. The index `i` and the values of `n`, `m`, `k - 1` are not mentioned, so they remain the same. The values of `a` and `b` are also not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1; `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value `c`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1; `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value `c`**
