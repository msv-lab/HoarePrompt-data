According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting, and the element at index `i + 1` of the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l` is updated to `c`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be incremented by 1.
