You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see examples of the loop executing several times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after the execution of the loop. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` had greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 or lower than one then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`, i equals n
Output State: **`if n is at least 1 then factorial` is the factorial of `n`, n is 0. if i is lower than 1 the loop doesnt execute and factorial is 1**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in thethe end students will be 0. if studenmts is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **`if students is greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to students, students is 0 at the end. if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**

Your Task:

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros
Code of the loop:
```
while k > 0:
    k -= 1
    a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if a == 1:
        for i in range(m):
            l[b - 1][i] = c
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            l[i][b - 1] = c

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. If a == 1 and m >= 1, the loop updates the 2D list `l` by setting the value at position (b - 1, i) to c for each i in the range of m. After the loop executes, n and m are still greater than or equal to 1, k is a positive integer decremented by 1, a remains 1, b and c retain the integers input by the user, and l is a 2D list of size n x m with values updated according to the loop. If m <= 0, no updates are made. If a != 1 and n > 0, the loop updates the 2D list `l` by setting all elements in column b - 1 to c. After the loop executes, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with all elements in column `b - 1` assigned the value `c`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1. If n == 0, no updates are made to l. In all cases, the variables retain their initial constraints and values as described above.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the loop updates the values in the `m` columns of row `b - 1` in the 2D list `l` to `c`. If `m` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute. After the loop, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their initial integer values, and `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with the specified values updated. If `a` is not equal to 1, the loop updates the element at column index `b-1` in each row of the 2D list `l` to the value of `c`. All variables retain their initial values. The loop executes `n` times as long as `n` is at least 1; if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n`, `m`, `k - 1` are positive integers and `k` is greater than 1. `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is at least 1, then after the loop executes, the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l` will have all elements updated to `c` for each iteration of the loop. If `m` is less than 1, no changes are made to `l`. If `a` is not equal to 1 and `n` is greater than 0, after the loop executes, all elements in the `l` list at index `b - 1` are assigned the value `c`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
