Example Answer:
The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are input by the user, and `i` is 2. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is positive integer decremented by 1, `l` is a 2D list of size n x m, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned integers input by the user, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is positive integer decremented by 1, `l` is a 2D list of size n x m, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned integers input by the user, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`**
