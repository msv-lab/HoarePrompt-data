According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. 
Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `n` remains as it is, as it is a positive integer.
2. `m` remains as it is, as it is a positive integer.
3. `k` should be adjusted to `k - 1`.
4. `l` should remain as a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros.
5. `a` should remain as the integer input by the user.
6. `b` should remain as the integer input by the user.
7. `c` should remain as the integer input by the user.
8. `a` should not be equal to 1.
Therefore, the adjusted state would be:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros. `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting. `a` is not equal to 1**.
