Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. If a == 1 and m >= 1, the loop updates the 2D list `l` by setting the value at position (b - 1, i) to c for each i in the range of m. After the loop executes, n and m are still greater than or equal to 1, k is a positive integer decremented by 1, a remains 1, b and c retain the integers input by the user, and l is a 2D list of size n x m with values updated according to the loop. If m <= 0, no updates are made. If a != 1 and n > 0, the loop updates the 2D list `l` by setting all elements in column b - 1 to c. After the loop executes, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints; `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with all elements in column `b - 1` assigned the value `c`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers input by the user after splitting; `a` is not equal to 1. If n == 0, no updates are made to l. In all cases, the variables retain their initial constraints and values as described above.***
