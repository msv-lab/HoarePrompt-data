According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already a positive integer, no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, the loop variable `i` needs to be initialized to 0 before the loop starts. Additionally, since `k` is greater than 1, `k - 1` is also a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k - 1` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 1, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting, `i` is 0**
