According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers. Therefore, for the loop to execute, you need to adjust the state such that `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k - 1` are positive integers, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the integers input by the user, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with values updated according to the loop, `i` is 0**
