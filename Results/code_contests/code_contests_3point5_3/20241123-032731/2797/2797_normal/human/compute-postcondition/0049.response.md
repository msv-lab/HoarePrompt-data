Example Answer:
The value of `l` is a 2D list. The code assigns the value of `c` to the element at index `i` of the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l`. After the execution, the element at index `i` of the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l` is updated to `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting, the element at index `i` of the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l` is updated to `c`**
