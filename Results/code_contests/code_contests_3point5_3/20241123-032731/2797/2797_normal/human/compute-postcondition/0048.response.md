According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the variables needed to be adjusted are:
`n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers
`k` needs to be at least 2
`a`, `b`, and `c` need to be assigned integer values from the input after splitting
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `k` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting**
