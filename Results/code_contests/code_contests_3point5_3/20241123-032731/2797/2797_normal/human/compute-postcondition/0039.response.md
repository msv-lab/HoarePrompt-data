Example Answer:
The value of l at index [i][b - 1] is updated to c. The previous values of n, m, k, a, b, and c remain the same. The condition a is not equal to 1 and i is less than n + 1 holds. 
Output State: **n, m, and k-1 are positive integers; a, b, and c retain the integers input by the user; l is a 2D list of size n x m with values updated according to the loop; a is not equal to 1; i is less than n + 1**
