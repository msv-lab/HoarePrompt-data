Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes input values for the dimensions of the sheet and the number of operations. It then initializes a 2D list representing the sheet with all cells colored in 0. It then iterates over the number of operations, and based on the query type, it paints the row or column with the specified color. Finally, it prints the resulting table after all operations are applied.

The program follows the problem description accurately by correctly updating the colors of the cells based on the query type (row or column) and the color specified. It handles both row and column painting operations and updates the table accordingly. The output format also matches the expected output format. 

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the functionality of the program, we can conclude that the code is correct.
