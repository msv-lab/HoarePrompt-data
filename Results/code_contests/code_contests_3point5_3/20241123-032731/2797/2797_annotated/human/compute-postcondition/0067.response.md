Output State: **If k is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After each iteration of the loop, k will be decreased by 1. Depending on the value of a, either the values in the row at index (b-1) or the column at index (b-1) of the 2D list l will be updated to the value of c. If a == 1 and m > 0, the row at index (b-1) will be updated for all columns. If m is 0 or negative, no updates will occur. If a != 1 and n > 0, the column at index (b-1) will be updated for all rows. If n is 0 or negative, no updates will occur. After the loop finishes, n, m, and k will be integers based on user input, l will be a 2D list with dimensions n rows and m columns initialized to 0, and k will be 0.**
