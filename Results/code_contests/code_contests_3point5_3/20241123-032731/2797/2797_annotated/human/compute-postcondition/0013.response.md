Output State: **If m is greater than 0, the loop will execute and fill the row at index (b - 1) of the 2D list l with the value c for each column. Therefore, after the loop executes, n, m is greater than 0, k is decreased by 1, l is a 2D list with dimensions n rows and m columns initialized to 0, a is 1, and the row at index (b - 1) of l is filled with the value c. If m is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and l remains a 2D list with dimensions n rows and m columns initialized to 0.**
