Example Answer:
The value of `k` is decreased by 1. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and the 2D list `l` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on user input, a 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, and `k` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on user input, a 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, and `k` is decreased by 1**
