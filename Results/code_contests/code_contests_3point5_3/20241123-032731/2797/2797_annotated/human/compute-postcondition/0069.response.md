The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing query operations described by integers a, b, and c. The constraints are as follows: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000. Each query operation is described by integers a, b, and c, where a is either 1 or 2, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n if a = 1, or 1 ≤ b ≤ m if a = 2, and c is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9. The function does not have a specific return value as it processes the query operations based on the given constraints. 
Functionality: **The function processes query operations described by integers a, b, and c based on given constraints without accepting any parameters.**
