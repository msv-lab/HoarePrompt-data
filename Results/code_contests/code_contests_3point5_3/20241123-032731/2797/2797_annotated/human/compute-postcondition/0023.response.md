Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on user input, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, and `k` is decreased by 1. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the row at index `b - 1` of `l` is filled with the value `c` for each column. If `m` is 0 or negative, `l` remains as a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0. If `a` is not equal to 1, the value of `c` is assigned to the element at index `b - 1` in each row of `l`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. In all cases, `k` is decreased by 1 at the end.***
