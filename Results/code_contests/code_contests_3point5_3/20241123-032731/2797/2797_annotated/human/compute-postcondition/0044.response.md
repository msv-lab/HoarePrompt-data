Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers based on user input, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, and `k` is decreased by 1. If `a` is equal to 1, the loop updates the values in the row at index `b-1` of the 2D list `l` to `c` for all columns. If `m` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. If `a` is not equal to 1, the loop assigns the value `c` to the element at index `i` and `b - 1` in the 2D list `l` for each row `i` in the range of `n`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are decreased by 1 after each iteration. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or negative.***
