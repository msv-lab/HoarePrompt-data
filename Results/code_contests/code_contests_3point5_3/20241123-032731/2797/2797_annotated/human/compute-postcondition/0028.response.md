Example Answer:
The value of `k` has been decreased by 1. The 2D list `l` is modified at index `(b-1, i)` where the value `c` is assigned. The initial state remains similar with the exception of the updated value in the 2D list.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on user input, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `l[b-1][i]` is assigned the value `c`**
