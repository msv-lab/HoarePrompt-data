According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are initialized based on user input, and `k` is decreased by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0 and `i` starts from 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1`, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values based on user input, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0**
