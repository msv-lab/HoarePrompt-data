Functionality: **The function reads three integers n, m, and k from user input. It then initializes a 2D list l of dimensions n rows and m columns with all elements set to 0. The function processes k query operations where each query consists of three integers a, b, and c. Depending on the value of a, if a == 1, it updates the row at index (b-1) of list l with value c for all columns; if a != 1, it updates the column at index (b-1) of list l with value c for all rows. After processing all queries, it prints the 2D list l formatted row by row. The function does not accept any parameters.**
