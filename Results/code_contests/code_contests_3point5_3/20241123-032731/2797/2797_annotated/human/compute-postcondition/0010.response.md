According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m + 1` columns initialized to 0, `a` is 1, and value `c` is stored in cell `l[b - 1][i]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m + 1` columns initialized to 0, `a` is 1, `c` is stored in cell `l[b - 1][i + 1]`**
