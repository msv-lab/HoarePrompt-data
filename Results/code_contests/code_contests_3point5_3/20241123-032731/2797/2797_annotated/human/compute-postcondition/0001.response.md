Example Answer:
A 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `m` are based on user input. The variable `k` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` and `k` are assigned values based on user input, and a 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n`, `m` and `k` are assigned values based on user input, and a 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0**
