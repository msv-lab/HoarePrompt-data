Postcondition: ***n, m, k-1, a, b, c are integers based on user input. If a == 1 and m > 0, the loop updates the values in the m-th column of the 2D list l at row index (b-1) with the value of c. If a == 1 and m <= 0, the loop does not execute. If a != 1 and n > 0, the loop updates the values in the b-1 column of the 2D list l at each row index with the value of c. If a != 1 and n <= 0, the loop does not execute. After the execution of the if else block, the values of n, m, k-1, l, a, b, c remain unchanged.***
