Example Answer:
The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`. The variables `b` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The dimensions of the 2D list `l` are `n` rows and `m` columns. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `a` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `a` is 1**
