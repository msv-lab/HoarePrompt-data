Example Answer:
`l[b-1][i]` is assigned the value `c`, where `b` and `i` are based on user input, `c` is a specific value. The dimensions of `l` are based on user input, and all elements are initialized to 0. Therefore, after the assignment, the value at position `l[b-1][i]` is updated to `c`. The value of `k` is decreased by 1. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on user input, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `k` is decreased by 1, the value at position `l[b-1][i]` is updated to `c`**
