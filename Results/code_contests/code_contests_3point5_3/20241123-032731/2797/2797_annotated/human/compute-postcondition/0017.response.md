According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the same, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 0, `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is the same, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 1, `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`**
