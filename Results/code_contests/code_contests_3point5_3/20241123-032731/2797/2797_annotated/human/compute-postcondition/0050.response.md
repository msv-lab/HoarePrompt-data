According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1`, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values based on user input, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, value at index (b - 1, i) in list `l` is updated to `c`**
