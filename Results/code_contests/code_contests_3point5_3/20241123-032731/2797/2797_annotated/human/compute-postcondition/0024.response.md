According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on user input, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, and `k` is decreased by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `k` needs to be greater than 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, so no adjustment is needed as it is already specified that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on user input, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1.**
