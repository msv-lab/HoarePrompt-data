According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `a` is 1. To execute one more time, `m` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current value of `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m + 1` columns initialized to 0, `a` is 1**
