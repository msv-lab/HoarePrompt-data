According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, so `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers based on user input, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, and `k` is decreased by 1.**
