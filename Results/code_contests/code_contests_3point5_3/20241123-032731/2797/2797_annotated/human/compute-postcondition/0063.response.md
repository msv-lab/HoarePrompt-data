According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns initialized to 0, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are assigned values based on user input, `i` is 3, the element at the `i`-th row and `b - 1` column of `l` is assigned the value of `c`**
