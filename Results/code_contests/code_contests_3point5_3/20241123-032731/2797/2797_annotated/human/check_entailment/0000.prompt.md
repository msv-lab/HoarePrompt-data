You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kris works in a large company "Blake Technologies". As a best engineer of the company he was assigned a task to develop a printer that will be able to print horizontal and vertical strips. First prototype is already built and Kris wants to tests it. He wants you to implement the program that checks the result of the printing.

Printer works with a rectangular sheet of paper of size n × m. Consider the list as a table consisting of n rows and m columns. Rows are numbered from top to bottom with integers from 1 to n, while columns are numbered from left to right with integers from 1 to m. Initially, all cells are painted in color 0.

Your program has to support two operations: 

  1. Paint all cells in row ri in color ai; 
  2. Paint all cells in column ci in color ai. 



If during some operation i there is a cell that have already been painted, the color of this cell also changes to ai.

Your program has to print the resulting table after k operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n·m ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 000) — the dimensions of the sheet and the number of operations, respectively.

Each of the next k lines contains the description of exactly one query: 

  * 1 ri ai (1 ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), means that row ri is painted in color ai; 
  * 2 ci ai (1 ≤ ci ≤ m, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), means that column ci is painted in color ai. 

Output

Print n lines containing m integers each — the resulting table after all operations are applied.

Examples

Input

3 3 3
1 1 3
2 2 1
1 2 2


Output

3 1 3 
2 2 2 
0 1 0 


Input

5 3 5
1 1 1
1 3 1
1 5 1
2 1 1
2 3 1


Output

1 1 1 
1 0 1 
1 1 1 
1 0 1 
1 1 1 

Note

The figure below shows all three operations for the first sample step by step. The cells that were painted on the corresponding step are marked gray.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    l = [[(0) for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
    """for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            print l[i][j],
        print"""
    while k > 0:
        k -= 1
        
        a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        if a == 1:
            for i in range(m):
                l[b - 1][i] = c
        else:
            for i in range(n):
                l[i][b - 1] = c
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If k is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After each iteration of the loop, k will be decreased by 1. Depending on the value of a, either the values in the row at index (b-1) or the column at index (b-1) of the 2D list l will be updated to the value of c. If a == 1 and m > 0, the row at index (b-1) will be updated for all columns. If m is 0 or negative, no updates will occur. If a != 1 and n > 0, the column at index (b-1) will be updated for all rows. If n is 0 or negative, no updates will occur. After the loop finishes, n, m, and k will be integers based on user input, l will be a 2D list with dimensions n rows and m columns initialized to 0, and k will be 0.
    print('\n'.join([''.join(['{:2}'.format(item) for item in row]) for row in l]))

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
