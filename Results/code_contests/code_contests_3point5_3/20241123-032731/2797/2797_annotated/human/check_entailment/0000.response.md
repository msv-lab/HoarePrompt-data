Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It initializes a 2D list representing the sheet of paper with all cells painted in color 0. It then processes each query by updating the corresponding row or column with the specified color. Finally, it prints the resulting table after all operations are applied.

The program covers all possible cases and there are no edge cases identified where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description.
