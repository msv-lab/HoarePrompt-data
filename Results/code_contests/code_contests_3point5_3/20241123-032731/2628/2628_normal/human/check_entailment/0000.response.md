Correctness: **False**

The code provided simply counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' characters in the input string `S`, and then prints the maximum count between '0's and '1's. However, this does not align with the problem description. The code does not implement the required logic to find the maximum integer K not greater than |S| such that we can turn all the characters of S into `0` by repeating the operation some number of times. 

For example, if the input string is "010", the correct output should be 2 as we can turn all characters into '0' by flipping the first two characters. However, the given code would output 1 as it simply counts the occurrences of '0' and '1'.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
