Example Answer:
`s1` is increased by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` has a length greater than 2, if the next character `c` is '0', `s0` is increased by at least 1, `s1` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`S` has a length greater than 2, if the next character `c` is '0', `s0` is increased by at least 1, `s1` is increased by 1**
