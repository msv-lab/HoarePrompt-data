Example Answer:
`s1` is increased by 1. The value of `s0` is not affected as the condition for incrementing `s0` is not met. Therefore, the Output State is: S has a length greater than 1, `s0` remains the same, and `s1` is increased by 1.
Output State: **S has a length greater than 1, `s0` remains the same, and `s1` is increased by 1**
