Postcondition: ***`S` is a string with a length greater than 2. If the next character `c` is '0', `s0` is increased by at least 1, `s1` remains the same. If the next character `c` is not '0', `s0` remains the same, and `s1` is increased by 1. In all cases, either `s0` or `s1` is increased by 1 based on the value of `c`.***
