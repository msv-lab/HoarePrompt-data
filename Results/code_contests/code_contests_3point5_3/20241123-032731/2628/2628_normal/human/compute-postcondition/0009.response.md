Example Answer:
`s0` is increased by 1. The previous value of `s0` is unknown, but after execution, `s0` will be at least 1. The value of `s1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` has a length greater than 1, `s0` is increased by at least 1, `s1` remains the same.
Output State: **`S` has a length greater than 1, `s0` is increased by at least 1, `s1` remains the same**
