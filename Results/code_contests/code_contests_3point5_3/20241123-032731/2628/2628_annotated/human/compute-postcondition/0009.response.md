Example Answer:
The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s0` is unknown, so the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least one more character available for iteration, `s0` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least one more character available for iteration, `s0` is incremented by 1**
