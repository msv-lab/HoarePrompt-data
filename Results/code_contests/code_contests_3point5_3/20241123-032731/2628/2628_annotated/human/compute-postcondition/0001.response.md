Example Answer:
The variables s0 and s1 are both assigned the value 0. Since both variables are already 0, the assignment does not change their values. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string consisting of '0' and '1', s0 is 0, s1 is 0.
Output State: **S is a string consisting of '0' and '1', s0 is 0, s1 is 0**
