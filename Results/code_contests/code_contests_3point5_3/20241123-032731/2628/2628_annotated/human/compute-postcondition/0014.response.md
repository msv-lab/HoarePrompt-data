Example Answer:
The value of `s1` is incremented by 1, but since `s1` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', adding 1 to it doesn't have a numerical meaning in this context. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least one more character available for iteration.
Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least one more character available for iteration**
