Example Answer:
The value of `s1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s1` is unknown as it is a string. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least one more character available for iteration, `s1` is a string with an unknown value after incrementing by 1.
Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least one more character available for iteration, `s1` is a string with an unknown value after incrementing by 1**
