Postcondition: ***`S` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' with at least one more character available for iteration. If `c` is '0', `s0` is incremented by 1. If `c` is '1', `s1` is incremented by 1. The program ensures that either `s0` or `s1` is incremented based on the value of `c`, maintaining the integrity of the input string `S`.***
