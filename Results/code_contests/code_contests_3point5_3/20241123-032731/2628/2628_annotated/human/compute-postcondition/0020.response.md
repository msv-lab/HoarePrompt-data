Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string `S` and counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' characters in the string. It then prints the maximum count between '0's and '1's. The function does not explicitly return a value, and it does not accept any parameters. If the input string is empty, both counts `s0` and `s1` will be 0.**
