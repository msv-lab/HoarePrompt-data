Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the maximum integer K such that we can turn all the characters of the string S into '0' by counting the number of '0's and '1's in the input string and taking the maximum of the counts. This logic satisfies the problem description for all potential cases as it identifies the maximum number of characters that can be changed to '0' in a single operation. Therefore, the program is correct.
