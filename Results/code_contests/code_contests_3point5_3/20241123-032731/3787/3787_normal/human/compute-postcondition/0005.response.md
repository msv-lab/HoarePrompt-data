Example Answer:
The code prints the first K characters of the string S followed by '...'. Since K is an input integer between 1 and 100, and S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length larger than K, the output will be the first K characters of string S followed by '...'.
Output State: **output the first K characters of string S followed by '...'**
