Functionality: **The function func_1 takes an integer input K and a string input S. If the length of string S is less than or equal to K, it prints the entire string S. Otherwise, it prints the first K characters of string S followed by '...'. The function then returns 0. The annotations suggest that K should be between 1 and 100, and S should consist of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100. However, the function does not restrict the input to these specific ranges.**
