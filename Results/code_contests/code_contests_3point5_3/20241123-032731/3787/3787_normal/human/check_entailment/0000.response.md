Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes an integer input `K` and a string input `S`.
- If the length of string `S` is less than or equal to `K`, it prints the entire string `S`.
- If the length of string `S` exceeds `K`, it extracts the first `K` characters in `S`, appends `...` to the end of them, and prints the result.
- The code is correctly implemented as per the problem description for all potential cases. It handles the scenarios where the length of `S` is at most `K` and when it exceeds `K` by extracting the first `K` characters and appending `...` to the end.
