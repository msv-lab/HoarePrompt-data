Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads an integer K from input and then reads a string S.
- It checks if the length of S is less than or equal to K, then it prints S as it is.
- If the length of S is greater than K, it extracts the first K characters and appends '...' to the end before printing.
- The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and handles the constraints mentioned.
