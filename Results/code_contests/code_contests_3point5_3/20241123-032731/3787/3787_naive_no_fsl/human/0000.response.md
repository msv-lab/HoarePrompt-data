Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads an integer K and a string S from standard input. If the length of S is at most K, it prints S without any change. If the length of S exceeds K, it extracts the first K characters in S, appends '...' to the end of them, and prints the result. The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The logic implemented in the program is correct and handles all constraints mentioned in the problem description.
