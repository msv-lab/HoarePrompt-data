Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an integer K and a string S as input, then checks if the length of S is less than or equal to K. If it is, it prints S as is. If the length of S exceeds K, it extracts the first K characters and appends '...' to the end before printing. The program meets all the constraints and handles both cases as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
