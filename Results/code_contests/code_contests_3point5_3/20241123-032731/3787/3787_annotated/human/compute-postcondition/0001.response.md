Example Answer: 
The variable `S` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, where `input()` accepts an input and `strip()` removes any leading and trailing whitespaces from the input. The length of `S` can be between 1 and 100, and it consists of lowercase English letters. Therefore, the Output State is: K is an integer between 1 and 100, S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100.
Output State: **K is an integer between 1 and 100, S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100**
