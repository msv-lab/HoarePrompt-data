Example Answer:
`K` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the value of `K` can be any integer between 1 and 100, the output state is: K is an integer between 1 and 100, S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100.
Output State: **K is an integer between 1 and 100, S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100**
