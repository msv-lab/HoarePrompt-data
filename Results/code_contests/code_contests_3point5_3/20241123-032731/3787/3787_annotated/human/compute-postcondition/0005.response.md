Example Answer:
The code prints the substring of S from index 0 to K-1 followed by '...'. Since K is an integer between 1 and 100, and S is a string with a length larger than K, the output will be the first K characters of S followed by '...'.
Output State: **The first K characters of S followed by '...'**
