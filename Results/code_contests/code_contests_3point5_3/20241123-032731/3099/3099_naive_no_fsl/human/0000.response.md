Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input of good letters, pattern, and query strings.
2. It correctly handles the case where there is no '*' in the pattern and iterates through each query string to check if it matches the pattern.
3. It correctly handles the case where there is '*' in the pattern, splits the pattern into two parts, and checks if the query strings match the pattern accordingly.
4. It properly checks each character in the query strings against the pattern, taking into account the special meaning of '?' and '*' as described in the problem description.
5. The program prints "YES" if the pattern matches the query string and "NO" otherwise, as required.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the expected output for the given input examples.
