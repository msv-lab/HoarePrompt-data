Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. `qr` is the reversed content of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `p1` does not contain '?' at index `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables' values.***
