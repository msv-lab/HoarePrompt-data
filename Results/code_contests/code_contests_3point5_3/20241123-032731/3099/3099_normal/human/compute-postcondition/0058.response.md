Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", `n` is a valid input string + 1, `good_letters` is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string p, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of string q, `y` is True if all characters in strings p and q match or if p contains '?' and q contains a character from `good_letters` at the corresponding index. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed and the loop does not execute, leaving all variables unchanged. After the execution of the if statement, the program remains in the same state as before, with no changes to the variables. The output 'YES' is printed if the condition y is True.***
