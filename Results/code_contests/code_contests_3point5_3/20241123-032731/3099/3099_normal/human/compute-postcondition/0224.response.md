Postcondition: ***`qr` is the reversed version of `q` and `p1len` is greater than 0. If the element at index `i` in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop. In all cases, `qr` and `q` remain unchanged, `p1len` remains greater than 0, and `y1` is set to False if the conditions are met.***
