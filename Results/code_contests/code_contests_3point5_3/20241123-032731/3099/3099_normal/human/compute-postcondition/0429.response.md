Postcondition: ***Initially, `y0` is False, `y1` is either False or True, `p1[i+1]` and `qr[i+1]` are checked, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and `p1len` is greater than 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop.***
