Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, p0 is split into p0 and p1, p1 is reversed, p0len is the length of the original p0 before splitting and reversing p1, p1len is the length of p1, n is greater than 0, q is the input from the user, qlen is the length of the input q. If qlen is less than p0len - 1, 'NO' is printed. The loop iterates through each character in p0, checking if the character is a '?'. If it is, the program verifies if the corresponding character in q is not in good_letters, printing 'NO' and setting y0 to False before breaking the loop. If the characters do not match, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all other cases, the loop continues and y0 remains True. If y0 is False after the if statement, the loop is continued.***
