According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the conditions specified for the variable y are not met. At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute again are that y remains True. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that y remains True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **y is True**
