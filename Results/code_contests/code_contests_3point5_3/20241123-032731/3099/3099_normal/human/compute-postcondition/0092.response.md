Postcondition: ***gls is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", n is a valid input string + 1, good_letters is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from gls, plen is the length of string p, q is an input string, qlen is the length of string q, y is False if q[i] is not in good_letters, i is 2. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], then 'NO' is printed, y remains False, and the loop breaks. This holds true for all possible values of p, q, and good_letters.***
