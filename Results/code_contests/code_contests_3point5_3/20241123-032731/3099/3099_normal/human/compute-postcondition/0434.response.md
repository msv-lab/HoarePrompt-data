Postcondition: ***Initially, `y0` is False, `y1` is either False or True, `p1[i+1]` and `qr[i+1]` are checked, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and `p1len` is greater than 1. After the execution of the if-else block, if `p1[i]` is '?', then the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. All variables retain their initial conditions.***
