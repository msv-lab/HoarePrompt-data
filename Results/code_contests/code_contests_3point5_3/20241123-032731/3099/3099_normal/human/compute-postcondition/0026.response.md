Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", `n` is a valid input string, `good_letters` is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from gls, `plen` is the length of string p, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of string q, `y` is either True or False based on the comparison of characters at index i in strings p and q. If the character at index i in string p is not equal to the character at index i in string q, the program prints 'NO' and sets y to False. In all cases, the program exits the loop after the if condition is checked.***
