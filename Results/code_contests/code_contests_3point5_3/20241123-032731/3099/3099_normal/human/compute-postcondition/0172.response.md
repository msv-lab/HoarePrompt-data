Postcondition: ***p0 is split into p0 and p1, p1 is reversed, p0len is greater than 0, p1len is the length of p1, n is greater than 0, q is the input from the user, qlen is the length of the input q, y0 is False and p0[i] is not equal to '?' and p0[i] is not equal to q[i]. In the case where p0[i] is not equal to q[i], the function prints 'NO', sets y0 to False, and breaks out of the loop.***
