According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p1`, `qr`, `good_letters`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `p1[i]` is '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In both cases, the program halts and updates `y1` based on the conditions met.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`y1` is a boolean, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2**
