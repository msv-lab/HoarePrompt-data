Postcondition: ***Initially, `y0` is False, `y1` is either False or True, `p1[i+1]` and `qr[i+1]` are checked, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and `p1len` is greater than 1. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then 'NO' is printed on the console, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The variables `y0`, `y1`, `p1[i+1]`, `qr[i+1]`, `qr`, and `p1len` retain their initial conditions.***
