Example Answer: 
The variable `qr` is assigned the reversed content of the list `q`. Since the initial state does not mention the value of `q`, we cannot determine the exact content of `qr`. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is True, `qr` is the reversed content of `q`.
Output State: **`y1` is True, `qr` is the reversed content of `q`**
