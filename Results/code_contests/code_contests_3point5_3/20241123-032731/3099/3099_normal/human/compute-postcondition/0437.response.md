Postcondition: ***If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain unchanged. If the loop does execute and `y1` is False, then `y0` remains False, `y1` is still False based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and the program prints 'NO' if certain conditions are not met.***
