Postcondition: ***`t` is a slice of `q` starting from index `p0len + 1` and ending at index `-p1len - 1`, `y0` is a boolean indicating whether the character at index `i` in `q` is in `good_letters`, `y1` is true, `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is updated to False, and the loop breaks.***
