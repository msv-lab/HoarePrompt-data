Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `p1[i]` is '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in good_letters. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In both cases, the program halts and updates `y1` based on the conditions met.***
