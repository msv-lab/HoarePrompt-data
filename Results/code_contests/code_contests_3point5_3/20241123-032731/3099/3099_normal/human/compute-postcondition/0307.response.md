Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean where True indicates that qr[i] is in good_letters for all i from 0 to the length of qr. If qr[i] is not in good_letters for any i, 'NO' is printed, and y1 becomes False. The content of `q` is reversed in `qr`, the length of `p1` denoted by `p1len` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i` in `p1` is '?'. The variable `i` is 0.***
