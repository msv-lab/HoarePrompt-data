Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is '?', then for all `i` from 0 to the length of `qr`, if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The content of `q` is reversed in `qr`, the length of `p1` denoted by `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.***
