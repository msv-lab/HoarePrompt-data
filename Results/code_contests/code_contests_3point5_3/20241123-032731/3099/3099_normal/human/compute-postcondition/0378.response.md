Postcondition: ***`y0` and `y1` are boolean variables. If `p0[i]` is equal to '?', then if the character at index `i` in the input string `q` is not in the list of `good_letters`, `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks. If `p0[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all cases, `y0` is updated to reflect the appropriate condition, 'NO' is printed if necessary, and the loop breaks if a condition is not met. After the execution of the if fragment, `y0` is False and the loop is terminated if the character at index `i` in the input string `q` is not in the list of `good_letters`. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
