Postcondition: ***`y` is a boolean. If the loop does not start (plen is 0), all variables retain their initial values. If p[i] == '?' and q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop is broken. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop is broken. Otherwise, y remains True. After the execution of the if else block, if y is True, 'YES' is printed.***
