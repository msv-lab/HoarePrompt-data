Postcondition: ***`y0` and `y1` are boolean variables. If `p0[i]` is equal to '?' and the character at index `i` in the input string `q` is not in the list of `good_letters`, `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks. If `p0[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all other cases where `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y0` remains unchanged.***
