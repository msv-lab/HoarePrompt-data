Postcondition: ***gls is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", n is a valid input string + 1, good_letters is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from gls, plen is the length of string p, q is an input string, qlen is the length of string q, y is False if q[i] is not in good_letters, i is 0. If the character at index i in string p is '?', and q[i] is not in good_letters, the program prints 'NO', sets y to False, and breaks the loop. If the character at index i in string p is not '?', and it is not equal to the character at index i in string q, the program prints 'NO', sets y to False, and breaks the loop. This postcondition ensures that the program handles cases where characters do not match and where '?' is present and matches the corresponding character in q.***
