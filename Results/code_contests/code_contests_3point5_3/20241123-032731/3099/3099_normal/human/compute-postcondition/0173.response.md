Postcondition: ***p0 is split into p0 and p1, p1 is reversed, p0len is greater than 0, p1len is the length of p1, n is greater than 0, q is the input from the user, qlen is the length of the input q. At index i, if the character in p0 is '?', the program checks if the character at index i in q is not in good_letters. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the character at index i in q is in good_letters, the loop continues and y0 remains True. If the character at index i in p0 is not '?', and it does not match the character at index i in q, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all other cases where the characters match, the loop continues and y0 remains True.***
