Output State: **`t` is either None or a slice of `q` that starts from index `p0len` and ends at index `-p1len`. If the intersection of `t` and `good_letters` has a length greater than 0, 'NO' is printed and the program continues. `y0` and `y1` are boolean values. If both `y0` and `y1` are true, 'YES' is printed. If `p1len` is 0, `t` will contain a slice of `q` starting from `p0len`. If `p1len` is not 0, `t` will be a slice of `q` from `p0len` up to the negation of index `p1len`. If the conditions are not met, 'NO' will be printed and the loop will continue.**
