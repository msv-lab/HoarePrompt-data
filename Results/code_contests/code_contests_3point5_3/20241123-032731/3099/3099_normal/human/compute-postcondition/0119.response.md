Postcondition: ***y is a boolean. If the character at index i in string p is '?', then if the character at index i in string q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the program breaks. Otherwise, if p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the program breaks. In all other cases, y remains True and the program continues with all variables retaining their initial values.***
