Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. All other cases maintain the original values of `y1`, `p1len`, and `i`.***
