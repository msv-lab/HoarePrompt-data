Postcondition: ***gls is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", n is a valid input string + 1, good_letters is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from gls, plen is the length of string p, q is an input string, qlen is the length of string q, y is False if q[i] is not in good_letters, i is 2. After the if-else block executes, if q[2] is not in good_letters, the program prints 'NO', assigns y as False, and breaks the loop. If q[2] is in good_letters and p[2] is equal to q[2], the loop continues without any changes. This guarantees that the program correctly handles the scenario where the character at index 2 in string q is not a good letter, along with ensuring the integrity of the initial variable conditions.***
