Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is assigned the slice of list `q` from index `p0len` up to the negation of index `p1len`. Since the initial state specifies `p1len` is not equal to 0, the slice will start from index `p0len` and omit the last `p1len` elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `p1len` is 0, `t` is a slice of list `q` from index `p0len` up to the negation of index `p1len`.
Output State: **`p1len` is 0, `t` is a slice of list `q` from index `p0len` up to the negation of index `p1len`**
