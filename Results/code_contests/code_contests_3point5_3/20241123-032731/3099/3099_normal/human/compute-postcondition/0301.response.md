According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p1len`. If `p1len` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `y1` being True and `qr` being the reversed content of `q` do not directly ensure that the loop will execute, so the states need to be adjusted to `p1len` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`y1` is True, `qr` is the reversed content of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
