According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `gls` is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", `n` is a valid input string + 1, `good_letters` is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is False if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **gls is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", n is a valid input string + 1, good_letters is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from gls, plen is the length of string p, q is an input string, qlen is the length of string q, y is False if q[i] is not in good_letters, i is 2**
