Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `qr` is assigned the reversed version of `q`. If `p1len` is greater than 0, the loop iterates through the elements of `p1` and `qr`, checking specific conditions. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is '?', and the corresponding element at index `i` in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is not '?', and it differs from the element at index `i` of `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p1len` is 0 or negative, the loop doesn't execute, maintaining the initial state of the variables. In all cases, if `y1` is False, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without altering the variables***.
