Postcondition: ***If y is True, the loop has checked each character in string p against the corresponding character in string q. If p contains a '?', it verifies that the character in q at that index is in good_letters. If any character does not match or '?' does not have a corresponding character from good_letters, 'NO' is printed, and y is set to False. If qlen is not equal to plen, the loop does not execute, leaving all variables unchanged. If all characters match or '?' is satisfied, 'YES' is printed. In the end, if y is True, 'YES' is printed, and all variables remain unchanged. If the loop did not execute due to unequal lengths of qlen and plen, all variables remain in their initial state.***
