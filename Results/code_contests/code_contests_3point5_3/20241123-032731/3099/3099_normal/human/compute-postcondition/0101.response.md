Example Answer:
The length of `q` is calculated and stored in `qlen`. The value of `q` is assigned from the user input, and the condition states that if `y` is True, all characters in string `p` match the corresponding characters in string `q` including '?' conditions, and `qlen` is equal to the length of `p`. Therefore, the output state is: If `y` is True, all characters in string `p` match the corresponding characters in string `q` including '?' conditions, `qlen` is equal to `plen`, `q` is assigned the value of raw_input().
Output State: **If `y` is True, all characters in string `p` match the corresponding characters in string `q` including '?' conditions, `qlen` is equal to `plen`, `q` is assigned the value of raw_input()**
