Postcondition: ***p0 is split into p0 and p1, p1 is reversed, p0len is greater than the current value, p1len is the length of p1, n is greater than 0, q is the input from the user, qlen is the length of the input q. If p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed and y0 is set to False, causing a break in the program.***
