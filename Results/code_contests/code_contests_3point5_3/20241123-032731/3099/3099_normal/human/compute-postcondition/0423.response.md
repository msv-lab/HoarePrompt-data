Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is either False or True, `p1[i]` and `qr[i]` values are checked, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. The state of the program after the execution of the if-else block ensures that the initial conditions are maintained, and the program handles the case where `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]` appropriately by printing 'NO', setting `y1` to False, and breaking out of the loop, without altering the other variables.***
