Output State: **The loop checks each character in string p against the corresponding character in string q. If p contains a '?', it verifies that the character in q at that index is in good_letters. If any character does not match or '?' does not have a corresponding character from good_letters, 'NO' is printed, and y is set to False. If qlen is not equal to plen, the loop does not execute, leaving all variables unchanged. If all characters match or '?' is satisfied, 'YES' is printed.**
