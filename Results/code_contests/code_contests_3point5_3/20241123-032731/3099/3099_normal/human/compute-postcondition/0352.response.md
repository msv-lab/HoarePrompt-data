Postcondition: ***`y0` and `y1` are boolean values. The loop has handled all conditions and maintained the relevant variable states. If `y0` is True and `y1` is True, the program will continue with the assigned values and logic flows described above, resulting in 'YES' being printed. The postcondition ensures that all possible edge cases and logic flows have been considered, guaranteeing that the loop will handle all conditions and maintain the relevant variable states.***
