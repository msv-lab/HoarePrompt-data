Example Answer:
The string p is split into two parts at the position of the "*", resulting in p0 and p1. The values of p0 and p1 are assigned accordingly. Since the initial state does not mention the values of p0 and p1, the output state will include that p is split into p0 and p1.
Output State: **p is split into p0 and p1**
