Postcondition: ***y is a boolean. If p[i] == '?', y remains True unless q[i] is not in good_letters, in which case 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop is broken. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop is broken. Otherwise, y remains True after the execution of the if else block, considering all edge cases.***
