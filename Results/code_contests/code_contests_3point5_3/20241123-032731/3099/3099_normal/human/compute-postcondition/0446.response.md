Postcondition: ***`p1len` is 0, `t` is either None or a slice of list `q`. If `p1len` is 0, `t` is assigned the value of `q` indexed from `p0len` onwards. If `p1len` is not 0, `t` is a slice of list `q` from index `p0len` up to the negation of index `p1len`. The intersection of elements in `t` and `good_letters` contains at least one element.***
