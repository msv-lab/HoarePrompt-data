Postcondition: ***`y0` and `y1` are boolean values, `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, the program prints 'NO' and continues execution. This ensures that the program handles the case when the length of the input string `q` is less than `plen - 1`.***
