Example Answer:
p1len is assigned the length of p1. The original state had p0 split into p0 and p1, p1 reversed, and p0len as the length of the original p0 before splitting and reversing p1. Therefore, the Output State is: p0 is split into p0 and p1; p1 is reversed, p0len is the length of the original p0 before splitting and reversing p1; p1len is the length of p1.
Output State: **p0 is split into p0 and p1; p1 is reversed, p0len is the length of the original p0 before splitting and reversing p1; p1len is the length of p1**
