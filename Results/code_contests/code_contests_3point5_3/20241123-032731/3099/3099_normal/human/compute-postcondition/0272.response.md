Postcondition: ***`t` is a slice of `q` that starts from index `p0len + 1` and ends at index `-p1len - 1`, `y0` is a Boolean indicating if the comparison failed, `y1` is true, `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the character at index i of p0 is not '?'. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This accounts for the scenario when the comparison at index i fails. The postcondition covers all edge cases including the initial conditions and the specific behavior when the comparison fails at index i.***
