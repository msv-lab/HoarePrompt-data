Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", `n` is a valid input string, `good_letters` is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string p, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of string q, `y` is either True or False based on the comparison of characters at index i in strings p and q for all i values, where if p[i] == '?' and q[i] not in good_letters, the function prints 'NO', sets y to False, and breaks the loop. If p[i] != q[i], the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop. All other variables retain their initial values.***
