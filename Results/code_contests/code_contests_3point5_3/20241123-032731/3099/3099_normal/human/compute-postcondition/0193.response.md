Postcondition: ***p0 is split into p0 and p1, p1 is reversed, p0len is greater than the current value, p1len is the length of p1, n is greater than 0, q is the input from the user, qlen is the length of the input q, `i` is incremented by 1. If q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. The program retains all initial conditions post execution of the if else block, including the changes made within the conditional statements.***
