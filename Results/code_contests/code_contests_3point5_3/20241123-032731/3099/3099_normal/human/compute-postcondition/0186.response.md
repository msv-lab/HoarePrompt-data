Example Answer:
The variable `y0` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: p0 is split into p0 and p1, p1 is reversed, p0len is greater than the current value, p1len is the length of p1, n is greater than 0, q is the input from the user, qlen is the length of the input q, `i` is incremented by 1, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is False.
Output State: **p0 is split into p0 and p1, p1 is reversed, p0len is greater than the current value, p1len is the length of p1, n is greater than 0, q is the input from the user, qlen is the length of the input q, `i` is incremented by 1, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is False**
