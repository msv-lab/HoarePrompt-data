According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean, the conditions for printing 'NO' and updating `y1` have been checked based on the elements at index `i` in `p1` and `qr`, the content of `q` has been reversed in `qr`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop is still executing, `y1` remains a boolean.
- Check the element at index `i+1` in `p1` to determine if 'NO' needs to be printed and `y1` needs to be updated.
- Check if the element at index `i+1` in `qr` is not in `good_letters` to decide if 'NO' needs to be printed and `y1` needs to be updated.
- Check if the element at index `i+1` in `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i+1` in `qr` to determine if 'NO' needs to be printed, `y1` needs to be updated, and the loop breaks.
- Increment `i` by 1.

State: **`y1` is a boolean, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
