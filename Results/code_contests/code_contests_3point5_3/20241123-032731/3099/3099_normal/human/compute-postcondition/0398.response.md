Postcondition: ***`y0` and `y1` are boolean variables. If `y0` is False, `y1` remains unchanged. In the case where the loop does not execute due to the edge case where `p0len` is 0, all variables, including `y0` and `y1`, remain unchanged. This if-else block does not introduce any changes unless `y0` is False.***
