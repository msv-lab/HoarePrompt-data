Postcondition: ***`qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is '?', then the program checks if the corresponding element at index `i` in `qr` is not in `good_letters`. If this condition is met, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is not '?', the program checks if the element at index `i` of `p1` is different from the element at index `i` of `qr`. If this condition is satisfied, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This postcondition ensures that the program handles both cases where '?' is present in `p1` and when it is not, maintaining the initial conditions and correctly printing 'NO' and updating `y1` accordingly.***
