Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", `n` is a valid input string, `good_letters` is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string p, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of string q, `y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at index i in string q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the program stops when encountering a character in q that is not in good_letters, maintaining the integrity of the input strings and the loop iteration.***
