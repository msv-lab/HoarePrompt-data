Postcondition: ***y0 and y1 are boolean variables. The loop checks each character at index i in the string q against the pattern p0. If p0[i] is equal to '?', it verifies if the character at index i in q is not in good_letters. If the condition is met, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p0[i] is not equal to '?' and p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. After each iteration, y0 is updated according to the conditions met. If the loop does not execute due to an edge case where p0len is 0, all variables remain unchanged. In addition, y0 is False.***
