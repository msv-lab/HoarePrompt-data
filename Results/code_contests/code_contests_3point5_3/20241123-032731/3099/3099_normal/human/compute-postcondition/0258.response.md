Postcondition: ***`t` is a slice of `q` that starts from index `p0len + 1` and ends at index `-p1len - 1`, `y0` and `y1` are true, `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, then the program prints 'NO' and continues execution. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables and the program continues normally.***
