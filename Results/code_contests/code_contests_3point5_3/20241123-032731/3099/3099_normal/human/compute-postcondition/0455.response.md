Postcondition: ***gls is a string with distinct lowercase English letters of length from 1 to 26, p is a string with lowercase English letters, "?" and "*" of length from 1 to 105, n is an input string, good_letters is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from gls, plen is the length of string p. If '*' is not in p, for each iteration of n, the program checks if qlen is equal to plen. If not, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues. If any character in p is '?' and the corresponding character in q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed. If any character does not match or '?' is not satisfied, 'NO' is printed. If all characters match or '?' is satisfied, 'YES' is printed. If '*' is in p, p is split into p0 and p1, where p1 is reversed. For each iteration of n, the program checks if qlen is less than plen - 1. If not, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues. If any character in p0 is '?' and the corresponding character in q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed. If any character does not match, 'NO' is printed. If any character in p1 is '?' and the corresponding character in q reversed is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed. If any character does not match, 'NO' is printed. If the intersection of t (a slice of q) and good_letters has a length greater than 0, 'NO' is printed. If all conditions are met, 'YES' is printed.***
