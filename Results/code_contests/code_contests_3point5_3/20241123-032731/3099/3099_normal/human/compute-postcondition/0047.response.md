Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", `n` is a valid input string, `good_letters` is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string p, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of string q. If the character at index i in string q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p[i] != q[i], 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The program handles the comparison of characters at index i in strings p and q, updating `y` based on the comparison result, while maintaining the integrity of the input variables and ensuring correct program behavior, considering all possible edge cases and handling them appropriately.***
