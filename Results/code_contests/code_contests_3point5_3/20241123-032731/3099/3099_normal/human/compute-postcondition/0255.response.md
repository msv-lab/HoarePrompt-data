Example Answer:
`qlen` is assigned the length of the input string `q`. The value of `q` is determined by user input, so the length of `q` is calculated and stored in `qlen`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a slice of `q` that starts from index `p0len + 1` and ends at index `-p1len - 1`, `y0` and `y1` are true, `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`.
Output State: **`t` is a slice of `q` that starts from index `p0len + 1` and ends at index `-p1len - 1`, `y0` and `y1` are true, `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`**
