Postcondition: ***`qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and exits the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited. In all other cases, no actions are taken, and the program continues execution.***
