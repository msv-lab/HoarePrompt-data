Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is either False or True depending on the conditions met during the execution of the if else block. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False before the loop breaks. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', 'NO' is printed if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and `y1` is set to False before the loop breaks. The state of the program after the if else block is determined by the values of `y0` and `y1`, `qr` being the reverse of `q`, and `p1len` being greater than 0.***
