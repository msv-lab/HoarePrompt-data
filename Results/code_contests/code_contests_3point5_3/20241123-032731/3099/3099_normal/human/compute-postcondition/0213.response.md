Postcondition: ***`qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list of characters, and none of the elements in `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?'. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the program correctly identifies when the elements at index `i` in `p1` and `qr` are not equal, prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop, maintaining the initial conditions.***
