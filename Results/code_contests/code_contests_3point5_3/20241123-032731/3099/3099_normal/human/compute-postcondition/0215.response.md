According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be less than `p1len + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0**
