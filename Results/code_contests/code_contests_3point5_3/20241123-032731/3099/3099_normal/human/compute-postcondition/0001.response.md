Example Answer:
The set `good_letters` is created by iterating over each character in `gls` and storing them. Since `gls` contains distinct lowercase English letters, the set `good_letters` will contain these distinct characters. The set `good_letters` will help in checking if a character is present in `gls` efficiently.
Output State: **gls is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", n is a positive integer, good_letters is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from gls**
