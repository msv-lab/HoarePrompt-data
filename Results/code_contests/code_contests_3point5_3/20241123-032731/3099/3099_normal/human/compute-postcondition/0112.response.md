Postcondition: ***`y` is a boolean. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, `y` is set to False and the program breaks. All characters in string `p` match the corresponding characters in string `q` including '?' conditions, `qlen` is equal to `plen`, `q` is assigned the value of raw_input(), `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `p` is '?'.***
