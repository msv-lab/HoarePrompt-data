Example Answer:
`y1` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `qr` and `p1len` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False.
Output State: **`qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False**
