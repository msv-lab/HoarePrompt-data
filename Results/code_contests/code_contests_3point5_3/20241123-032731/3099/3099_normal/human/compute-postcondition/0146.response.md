Output State: **If qlen is not equal to plen, 'NO' is printed, and the loop does not execute. All variables remain in their initial state. If p contains a '?', it checks if the corresponding character in q is in good_letters. If any character does not match or '?' is not satisfied, 'NO' is printed, and y is set to False. If all characters match or '?' is satisfied, 'YES' is printed. After the loop executes, all variables retain their values from the last iteration.**
