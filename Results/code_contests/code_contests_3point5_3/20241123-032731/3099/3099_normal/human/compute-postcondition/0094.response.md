According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `plen`. If `i` is less than `plen`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is the length of string p, `i` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `3`.
State: **gls is a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of length 1 to 105 consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", n is a valid input string + 1, good_letters is a set containing distinct lowercase English letters from gls, plen is the length of string p, q is an input string, qlen is the length of string q, y is False if q[i] is not in good_letters, i is 3**
