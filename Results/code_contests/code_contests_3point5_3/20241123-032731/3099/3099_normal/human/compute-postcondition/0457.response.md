Functionality: **The function `func` reads inputs and processes them based on certain conditions. If the string `p` does not contain '*', it compares each character of string `q` with string `p`, printing 'YES' if they match, and 'NO' otherwise. If `p` contains '*', it splits `p` into two parts and checks specific conditions for each part of `q`, printing 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function handles cases where the lengths of `p` and `q` do not match, characters do not match, or if `q` contains characters not present in `good_letters`.**
