Example Answer:
The input is taken and stored in `q`, but the initial state of `y0` and `y1` is not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` and `y1` are boolean values, `q` is the input string.
Output State: **`y0` and `y1` are boolean values, `q` is the input string**
