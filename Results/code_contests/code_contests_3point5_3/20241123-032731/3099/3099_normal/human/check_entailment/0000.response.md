Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input strings and processes them based on the conditions given in the problem description.
- If the pattern string `p` does not contain '*', it compares each character of the query string `q` with the pattern string `p`, printing 'YES' if they match and 'NO' otherwise. This logic aligns with the problem description.
- If the pattern string `p` contains '*', it splits `p` into two parts and checks specific conditions for each part of the query string `q`, printing 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. This also aligns with the problem description.
- The code also considers cases where the lengths of the pattern and query strings do not match, characters do not match, or if the query string contains characters not present in `good_letters`.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
