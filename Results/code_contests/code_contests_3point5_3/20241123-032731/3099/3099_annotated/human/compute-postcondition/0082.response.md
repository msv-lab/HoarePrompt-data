Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is a boolean. If there exists an index `i` such that `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
