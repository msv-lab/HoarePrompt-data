Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `y1` is a boolean indicating the validity of the comparison, `i` is an integer representing the index being checked, and `p1len` is an integer greater than 0. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is '?', `y1` remains True, and the program proceeds. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `p1[i]` is not '?' and not equal to `qr[i`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In cases where the loop does not execute (p1len is 0), `y1` remains True. Upon entering the if condition (y1 == False), the state of the program is such that `y1` is False.***
