Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters` and the element at index `i` in list `p1` is equal to '?'. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` becomes False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `y1` remains True. If the element at index `i` in list `p1` is not equal to '?', and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all other cases, the program variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
