Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `p0`, `p1`, `p1`, `p0len`, `p1len`, `n`, `q`, `y0` are all input strings or variables as described. `plen` is the length of `p`. `p0` is the part of the string before '*', `p1` is the part of the string after '*'. `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string. `p0len` is the length of `p0` and is greater than or equal to 1. `p1len` is the length of the reversed `p1` string. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `q` is the input string from raw_input(). `qlen` is the length of string `q`. `y0` is True. The program handles the case where the ith character of `p0` is '?', and the ith character of `q` is not in the set of `good_letters`. In this case, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Additionally, the program accounts for the scenario where the characters at position `i` in `p0` and `q` are not equal, printing 'NO', setting `y0` to False, and breaking the loop. The postcondition ensures that the program correctly responds to varying character conditions, maintaining the integrity of the variables and their relationships.***
