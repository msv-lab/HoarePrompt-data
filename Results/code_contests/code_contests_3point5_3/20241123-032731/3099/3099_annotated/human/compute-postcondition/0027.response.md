Postcondition: ***`gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string, `p` is the input string from raw_input() with at least 1 character, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is assigned the value from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `qlen` is equal to `plen`. If the character at position `i` in string `p` is '?', then the program checks if the character at the same position in string `q` is not in the set of good letters. If this condition is true, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. In the case where the character at position `i` in string `p` is not '?', the program checks if the characters at the same position in strings `p` and `q` are not equal. If this condition is true, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This postcondition ensures that the program handles all scenarios where the characters at the corresponding positions in strings `p` and `q` do not match the specified conditions, maintaining the integrity of the program's logic.***
