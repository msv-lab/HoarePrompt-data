Example Answer: 
The variable `plen` is assigned the length of the input string `p` from raw_input(). The previous values of `gls`, `good_letters`, and `p` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string, `p` is the input string from raw_input(), `plen` is the length of the input string `p`.
Output State: **`gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string, `p` is the input string from raw_input(), `plen` is the length of the input string `p`**
