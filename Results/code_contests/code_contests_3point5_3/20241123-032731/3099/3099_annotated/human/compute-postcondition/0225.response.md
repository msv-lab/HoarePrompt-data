According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `p1len` is an integer greater than 0. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `p1len`, so `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`y1` is a boolean, `i` is the current value of `i` incremented by 1, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0**
