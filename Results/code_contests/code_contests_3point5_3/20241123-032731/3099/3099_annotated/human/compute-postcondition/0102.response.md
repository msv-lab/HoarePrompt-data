Example Answer:
The code prints 'NO' to the console. The values of `q`, `qlen`, `plen`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is the range value for the loop, `y` is a boolean, `n` is incremented.
Output State: **`q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is the range value for the loop, `y` is a boolean, `n` is incremented**
