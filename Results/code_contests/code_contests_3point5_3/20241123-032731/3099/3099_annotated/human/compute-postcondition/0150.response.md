Example Answer: 
`p0len` is assigned the length of `p0`, which is the part of the string before '*'. The length of a string can be calculated, so `p0len` will be a specific integer value based on the input string p. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: gls is the input string, good_letters is a set of unique characters from the input string, p is the input string from raw_input(), plen is the length of the input string p, p0 is the part of the string before '*', p1 is the part of the string after '*', p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string, p0len is the length of p0.
