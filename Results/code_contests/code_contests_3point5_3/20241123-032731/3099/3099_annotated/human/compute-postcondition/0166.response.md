Postcondition: ***gls is the input string, good_letters is a set of unique characters from the input string, p is the input string from raw_input(), plen is the length of the input string p, p0 is the part of the string before '*', p1 is the part of the string after '*', p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string, p0len is the length of p0 and is greater than or equal to 1, p1len is the length of the reversed p1 string, n is greater than or equal to 1, q is the input string from raw_input(), qlen is the length of string q. If the ith character of p0 is '?', and the ith character of q is not in the set of good_letters, then the program prints 'NO', sets y0 to False, and breaks. This covers the case where the ith character of q is not in the set of good_letters.***
