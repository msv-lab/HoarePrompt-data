Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, where `qr` is the reversed version of `q`. `p1len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. `i` is set to 1. `q` represents the user input value. `t` is assigned as `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0; otherwise, it is set to the sublist of `q` starting from index `p0len` and ending at the index before `p1len`. `qlen` is the length of `q`. `y0` is a boolean. When `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. All these conditions together define the final state of the program after the execution of the if else block.***
