Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `p0`, `p1`, `p1`, `p0len`, `p1len`, `n`, `q`, `y0` are all input strings or variables as described. `plen` is the length of `p`. `p0` is the part of the string before '*', `p1` is the part of the string after '*'. `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string. `p0len` is the length of `p0` and is greater than or equal to 1. `p1len` is the length of the reversed `p1` string. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `q` is the input string from raw_input(). `qlen` is the length of string `q`. `y0` is True. The condition (p0[i] == '?') is false. If p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, and `y0` is set to False, causing the loop to break. This ensures that the program responds correctly when the characters at position `i` in `p0` and `q` are not equal, updating the state of `y0` accordingly.***
