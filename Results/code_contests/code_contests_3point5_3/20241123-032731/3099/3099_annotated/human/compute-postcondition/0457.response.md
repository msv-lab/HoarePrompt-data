Functionality: **The function `func` reads input strings, processes them based on specified conditions, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. It handles cases where the input string contains '?' and '*' characters, checks for matching characters in query strings, and validates the input based on certain rules. The function ensures correct comparisons between characters and outputs the results appropriately. However, it lacks explicit validation for some edge cases, such as when the input strings are empty or when handling special characters other than '?'.**
