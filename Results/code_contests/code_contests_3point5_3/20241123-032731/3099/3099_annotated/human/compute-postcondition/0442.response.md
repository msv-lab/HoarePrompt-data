Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value of the slice `q[p0len:]`. The value of `t` is None, and the value of `p1len` is an integer with a value of 0. Since the slice operation does not change the value of `t`, the output state is: `t` is None, `p1len` is an integer with a value of 0.
Output State: **`t` is None, `p1len` is an integer with a value of 0**
