Postcondition: ***`q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is either True or False, `n` is incremented, `i` is one more than the previous iteration. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `q[i]` is not in good_letters. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. This ensures that the program handles cases where the characters at index i in `p` and `q` do not match, leading to 'NO' being printed and `y` being set to False.***
