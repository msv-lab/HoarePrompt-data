Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. The variables remain unchanged after the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a slice of `q` based on the conditions stated. The intersection of `t` with `good_letters` has at least one element.
