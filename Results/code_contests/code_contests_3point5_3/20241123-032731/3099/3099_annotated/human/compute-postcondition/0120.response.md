According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `plen`. If `i` is less than `plen`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is either True or False, and `n` is incremented. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Increment the value of `i` by 1.
2. No other states need to be adjusted as per the given information.

State: **`q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is either True or False, `n` is incremented, `i` is one more than the previous iteration**
