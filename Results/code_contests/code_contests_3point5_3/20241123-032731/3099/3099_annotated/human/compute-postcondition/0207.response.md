Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks. In all other cases, `y1` remains True. `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `p1` is a list where the element at index 0 is '?'.***
