According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean, `i` is the current value of `i` incremented by 1, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `p1len+1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`y1` is a boolean, `i` is the current value of `i` incremented by 1, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is less than `p1len+1`**
