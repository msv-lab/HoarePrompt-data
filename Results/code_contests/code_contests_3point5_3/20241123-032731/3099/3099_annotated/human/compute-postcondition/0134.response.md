Postcondition: ***`q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is either True or False, `n` is incremented, `i` is one more than the previous iteration, and `i` is less than `plen`. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in the list `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop.***
