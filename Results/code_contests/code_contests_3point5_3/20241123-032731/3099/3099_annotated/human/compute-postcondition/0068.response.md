Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is True; `qlen` is equal to `plen`. The character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to '?' and the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`.***
