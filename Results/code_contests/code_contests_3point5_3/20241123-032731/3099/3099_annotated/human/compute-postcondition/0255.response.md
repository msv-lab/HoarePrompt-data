Example Answer:
`qlen` is assigned the length of `q`, where `q` is the input provided by the user. The values of `p0len` and `p1len` are not provided, so the exact length of `q` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is assigned a slice of `q` based on updated `p0len` and `p1len`, `q` is updated based on user input, and `qlen` is the length of `q`.
Output State: **`t` is assigned a slice of `q` based on updated `p0len` and `p1len`, `q` is updated based on user input, and `qlen` is the length of `q`**
