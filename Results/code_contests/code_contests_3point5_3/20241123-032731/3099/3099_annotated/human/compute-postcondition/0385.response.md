Output State: **`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, `p1len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is set to 2, `q` represents the user input value, `t` is assigned as `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0, `t` is set to the sublist of `q` starting from index `p0len` and ending at the index before `p1len`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean, if `p0[i] == '?'` and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken, if `p0[i] != q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken.**
