Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `q` is the user input value, `t` is set to `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is set to the sublist of `q` from index `p0len` to the end minus `p1len`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean. If `p0[i] != q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop. The postcondition handles all possible edge cases and ensures the correct handling of variable values and relationships after the if statement executes.***
