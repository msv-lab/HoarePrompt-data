Postcondition: ***`q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is either True or False, `n` is incremented. If the ith element of `p` is '?', and the ith element of `q` is not in the list of good_letters, then 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False. A break statement is encountered. If the ith element of `p` is not equal to the ith element of `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and a break statement is executed. Additionally, if the ith element of `p` is not equal to '?', `y` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and a break statement is encountered.***
