Example Answer:
`qlen` is assigned the length of `q` using the `len()` function. The value of `q` is a string, which means `qlen` will be the length of that string. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`.
Output State: **`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`**
