Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is the current value of `i` incremented by 1, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0. If `p1[i] == '?'` and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If `p1[i] != qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In all other cases, the program continues execution smoothly.***
