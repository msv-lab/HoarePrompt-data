Postcondition: ***t is assigned a slice of q based on updated p0len and p1len, q is updated based on user input, qlen is the length of q, if qlen is less than plen - 1, then 'NO' is printed and the program continues. y0 is False, p0len is greater than 0, i is 0, p0[i] is equal to '?'. If q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, and y0 is set to False. The program breaks from the loop.***
