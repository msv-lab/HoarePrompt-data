Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'NO' to the console but does not affect any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, all other variables retain their initial values.
Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, all other variables retain their initial values**
