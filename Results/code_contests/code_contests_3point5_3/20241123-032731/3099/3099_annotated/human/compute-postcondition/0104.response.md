Postcondition: ***`q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is the range value for the loop, `y` is a boolean, and `n` is incremented. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the program prints 'NO' and continues the loop. In this scenario, the program remains in the loop without any other changes.***
