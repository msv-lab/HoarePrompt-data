According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p1len` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `q`, `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `q`, `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
