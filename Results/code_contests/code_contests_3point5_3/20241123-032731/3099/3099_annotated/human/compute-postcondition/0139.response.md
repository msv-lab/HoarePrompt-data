Postcondition: ***`q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is either True or False, `n` is incremented, `i` is one more than the previous iteration, and `i` is less than `plen`. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in the list `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. The overall state of the program after the if else block is the same as the precondition except for the potential modification of `y` to False and the potential print statement 'NO'.***
