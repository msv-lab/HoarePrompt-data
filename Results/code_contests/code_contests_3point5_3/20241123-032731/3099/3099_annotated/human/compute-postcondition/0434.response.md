Postcondition: ***After the completion of the if-else block, `y0` remains True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If this condition is true, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, increments `i` by 1, and breaks out of the loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the program also prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, increments `i` by 1, and breaks out of the loop or if statement. The code correctly handles the scenarios where `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters` and where `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, ensuring that the program maintains the initial state of the variables and handles these cases appropriately.***
