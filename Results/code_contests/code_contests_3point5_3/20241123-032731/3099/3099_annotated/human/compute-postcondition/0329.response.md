Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `q`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If the element at index 2 of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the program handles the case where the specific element at index 2 of `qr` is not among the `good_letters` provided.***
