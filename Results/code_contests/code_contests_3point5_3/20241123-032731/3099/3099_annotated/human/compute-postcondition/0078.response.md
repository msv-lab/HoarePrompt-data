Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is a boolean value that is True or False. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in the list of `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and exits the loop. This condition handles the case when a character in `q` is not in `good_letters`.***
