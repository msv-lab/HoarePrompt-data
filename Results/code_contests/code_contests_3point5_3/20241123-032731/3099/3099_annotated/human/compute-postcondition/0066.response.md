Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is either True or False depending on whether any character at index `i` in `q` is not in the list `good_letters`; `qlen` is equal to `plen`; `p` is a list; `i` is an index within the range of `plen`; the element at index `i` in `p` is equal to '?'. If any character at index `i` in `q` is not in the list `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False and 'NO' is printed before breaking out of the loop. Otherwise, `y` remains True.***
