Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is a boolean. If there exists a character in `q` that is not present in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', updates `y` to False, and stops the loop. In the case where there is an index `i` such that `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `q`, `qlen`, `plen`, and `y` after the execution of the if else block.***
