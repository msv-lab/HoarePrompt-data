Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean representing the validity of the comparison, `i` is an integer indicating the index being checked, and `p1len` is an integer greater than 0 denoting the length of `p1`. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is '?', then `y1` remains True, `i` is 0, and the program will continue. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited.***
