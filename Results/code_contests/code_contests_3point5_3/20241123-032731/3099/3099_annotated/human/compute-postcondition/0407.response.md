Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i` in list `p1` is equal to '?'. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` becomes False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `y1` remains True.***
