Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the input, which could be any integer. The variables `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, and `plen` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string, `p` is the input string from raw_input(), `plen` is the length of the input string `p`.
Output State: **`gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string, `p` is the input string from raw_input(), `plen` is the length of the input string `p`**
