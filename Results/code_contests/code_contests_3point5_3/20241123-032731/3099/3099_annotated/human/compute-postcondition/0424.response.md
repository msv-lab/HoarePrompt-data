Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, all other variables retain their initial values. If p1[i] == '?', the program checks if qr[i] is not in good_letters. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If p1[i] != qr[i], 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This comprehensive postcondition ensures that the program handles all scenarios where qr[i] is not in good_letters or where p1[i] is not equal to qr[i], maintaining the necessary conditions to ensure program correctness.***
