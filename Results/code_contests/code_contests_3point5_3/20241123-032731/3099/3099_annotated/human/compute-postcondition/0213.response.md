Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0, the value at index `i` in the list `p1` is not equal to '?', and the value at index `i` in the list `qr` is not equal to the value at index `i` in the list `p1`. If the condition `p1[i] != qr[i]` is met, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited.***
