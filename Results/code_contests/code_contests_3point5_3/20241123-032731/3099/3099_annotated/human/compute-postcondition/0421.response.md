Example Answer:
`y1` is directly assigned the value `False`. The initial state of `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, all other variables retain their initial values.
Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, all other variables retain their initial values**
