Example Answer:
The input string `p` is split into two parts at the wildcard character '*', resulting in `p0` and `p1`. The previous values of `p`, `gls`, `good_letters`, and `plen` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: gls is the input string, good_letters is a set of unique characters from the input string, p is the input string from raw_input(), plen is the length of the input string p, p0 is the part of the string before '*', p1 is the part of the string after '*'.
Output State: **gls is the input string, good_letters is a set of unique characters from the input string, p is the input string from raw_input(), plen is the length of the input string p, p0 is the part of the string before '*', p1 is the part of the string after '*'**
