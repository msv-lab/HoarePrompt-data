Postcondition: ***`gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string, `p` is the input string from raw_input(), `plen` is the length of the input string `p`. If '*' is not in `p`, the program checks if the length of input string `q` matches `plen`. If not, 'NO' is printed. If the characters at corresponding indices in `p` and `q` do not meet the specified conditions, 'NO' is printed. If all conditions are met, 'YES' is printed. If '*' is in `p`, the program splits `p` into `p0` and `p1`. It then reverses `p1` and compares the characters in `p0` and `q` followed by the characters in `p1` and the reversed `q`. If any characters do not meet the specified conditions, 'NO' is printed. If the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` contains any element, 'NO' is printed. If all conditions are met, 'YES' is printed. This ensures that the program handles all cases correctly, including edge cases, and maintains the integrity of the logic.***
