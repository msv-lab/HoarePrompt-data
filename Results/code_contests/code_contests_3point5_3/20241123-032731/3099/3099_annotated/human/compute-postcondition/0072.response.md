Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is a boolean indicating whether the characters at corresponding indices in strings `p` and `q` are equal. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. Initially, `y` is True, and `qlen` is equal to `plen`. The character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to '?' and the program maintains the integrity of the loop and variable values throughout the execution.***
