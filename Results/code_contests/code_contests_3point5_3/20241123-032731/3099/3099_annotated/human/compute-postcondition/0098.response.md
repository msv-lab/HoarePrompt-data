Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is a boolean. If any character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters` or if the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if all conditions are met, 'YES' is printed, and no changes are made to the variables `q`, `qlen`, `plen`, and `y`.***
