Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the index of the current iteration in the range of `p1len`, `q` is a list or string, and `t` is set to `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0. Otherwise, `t` is set to the sublist of `q` from index `p0len` to the end minus `p1len`. This covers all possible scenarios, including the edge cases of `p1len` being equal to 0 or greater than 0.***
