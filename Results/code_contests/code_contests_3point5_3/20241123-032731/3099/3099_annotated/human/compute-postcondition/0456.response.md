The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function processes the input constraints as described above, which include a string of distinct lowercase English letters representing good letters, a string pattern containing lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", an integer n representing the number of query strings, and n non-empty strings consisting of lowercase English letters representing the query strings. The function then returns the output based on the input constraints.
