Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `q` is a list or string, the element at index `i` in `p1` is equal to '?'. If the element at index `i` in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues with the initial conditions unchanged.***
