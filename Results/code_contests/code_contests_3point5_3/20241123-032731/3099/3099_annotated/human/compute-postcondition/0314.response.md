Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and `qr`, where True signifies a match and False signifies a mismatch. `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `q` is a list or string. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is equal to '?', the program checks if the corresponding element in `qr` is not in `good_letters`. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues without altering the initial conditions. In the else part, if the element at index `i` in `p1` is not equal to '?', the program checks if it is not equal to the corresponding element in `qr`. If they differ, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. The postcondition covers all scenarios where the program variables are updated based on the conditions met during the execution of the if else block, ensuring the correctness and integrity of the program.***
