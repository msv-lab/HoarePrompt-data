Example Answer: 
`y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables are `q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is the range value for the loop, and `i` is less than `plen`. Since only `y` is affected by the code, the output state is: `q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is False; `i` is less than `plen`.
Output State: **`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is False; `i` is less than `plen`**
