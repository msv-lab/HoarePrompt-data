Postcondition: ***`gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string, `p` is the input string from raw_input() with at least 1 character, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is assigned the value from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `qlen` is equal to `plen`, `i` is incremented by 2. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', then the character at index `i` of string `q` must be in the set `good_letters`; otherwise, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the program state after the if-else block executes.***
