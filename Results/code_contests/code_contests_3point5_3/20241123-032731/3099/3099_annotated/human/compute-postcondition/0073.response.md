Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is a boolean that indicates whether any character at index `i` in `q` is not in the list `good_letters` or if the characters at corresponding indices in strings `p` and `q` are not equal. Initially, `y` is True, and `qlen` is equal to `plen`. After the execution of the if else block, `y` is set to False and 'NO' is printed if any character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters` or if the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`. The loop is broken in both cases to maintain the integrity of the program.***
