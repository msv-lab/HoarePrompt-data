Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `q`, `qr`. `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the character at position `i` in `qr` is not in the list of `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop. The postcondition covers all edge cases including the case where `p1[i]` is equal to '?' and the corresponding `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, as well as the case where `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, leading to 'NO' being printed and `y1` being set to False.***
