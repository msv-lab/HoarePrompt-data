Postcondition: ***t is assigned a slice of q based on updated p0len and p1len, q is updated based on user input, qlen is the length of q. If qlen is less than plen - 1, 'NO' is printed and the program continues. y0 is set to False if p0[i] is equal to '?' and q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p0[i] is equal to q[i] for all i, y0 is set to True. p0len is greater than 0, i is 0, and the state of the program variables is updated according to the defined conditions in the if and else blocks.***
