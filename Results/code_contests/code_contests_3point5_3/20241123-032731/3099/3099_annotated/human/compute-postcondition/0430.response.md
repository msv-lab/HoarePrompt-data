Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('NO')` simply prints 'NO' to the console. The variables `y0`, `y1`, `i`, and all other variables retain their initial values and are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values.
Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values**
