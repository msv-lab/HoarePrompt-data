Postcondition: ***`gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string, `p` is the input string from raw_input(), `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `p0` is the part of the string before '*', `p1` is the part of the string after '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the reversed `p1` string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is the input string from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of string `q`. If the length of `q` is less than `plen - 1, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables or their relationships after the execution of the if statement.***
