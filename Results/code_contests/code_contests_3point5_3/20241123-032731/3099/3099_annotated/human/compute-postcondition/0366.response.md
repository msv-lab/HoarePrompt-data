Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `q` is the user input value, `t` is set to `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is set to the sublist of `q` from index `p0len` to the end minus `p1len`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean (can be either True or False), and the character at index `i` in `p0` is equal to '?'. If the character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` is set to False. The program breaks out of the loop after this if condition.***
