Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `p1len` is an integer greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. The program handles all cases of `p1[i]` and `qr[i]` values appropriately, ensuring the correct behavior and termination of the loop.***
