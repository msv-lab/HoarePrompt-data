Postcondition: ***`t` is None. If `p1len` is equal to 0, `t` contains the elements of `q` from index `p0len` to the end. If `p1len` is not 0, `t` contains the elements of `q` from index `p0len` up to the index before the last `p1len` elements. The set intersection of `t` and `good_letters` has more than 0 elements.***
