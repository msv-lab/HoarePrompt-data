Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, t is assigned a slice of q based on updated p0len and p1len, q is updated based on user input, qlen is the length of q. If qlen is less than plen - 1, 'NO' is printed, and the program continues. The loop iterates over p0 checking if the characters match with q. If p0[i] is equal to '?', and q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If all characters in p0 match with q, y0 is set to True. The loop will not execute if p0len is 0. After the if condition, y0 is False.***
