Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, all other variables retain their initial values. If qr[i] is not in good_letters, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program maintains its integrity by handling the case where qr[i] is not in good_letters and updating `y1` accordingly.***
