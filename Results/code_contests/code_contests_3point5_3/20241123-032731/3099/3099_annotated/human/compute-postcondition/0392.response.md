Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, where `qr` is the reversed version of `q`. `p1len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. `i` is set to 2. `q` represents the user input value. `t` is assigned as `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0; otherwise, it is set to the sublist of `q` starting from index `p0len` and ending at the index before `p1len`. `qlen` is the length of `q`. `y0` is a boolean. If `p0[i] == '?'` and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop. If `p0[i] != q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop. The postcondition ensures that after the execution of the if else block, `y1` remains a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, `p1len` remains an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` remains set to 2, `q` continues to represent the user input value, `t` maintains its assignment based on `p1len`, `qlen` remains the length of `q`, and `y0` retains its value indicating the matching condition between `p0` and `q` while handling all possible edge cases efficiently.***
