Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `y1` remains a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, where `qr` is the reversed version of `q`. `p1len` remains an integer greater than or equal to 0. `i` remains set to 2. `q` continues to represent the user input value. `t` is assigned as `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0; otherwise, it is set to the sublist of `q` starting from index `p0len` and ending at the index before `p1len`. `qlen` remains the length of `q`. `y0` retains its value indicating the matching condition between `p0` and `q`, where `y0` is False if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If `p0[i] == '?'` and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop. If `p0[i] != q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop. All other variables maintain their initial values, ensuring the correct state of the program variables and their relationships are preserved after the if else block, covering all possible edge cases efficiently.***
