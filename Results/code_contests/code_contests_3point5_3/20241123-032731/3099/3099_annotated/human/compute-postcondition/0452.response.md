Postcondition: ***`t` is None. If `p1len` is equal to 0, `t` contains the elements of `q` from index `p0len` to the end. If `p1len` is not 0, `t` contains the elements of `q` from index `p0len` up to the index before the last `p1len` elements. If the set intersection of `t` and `good_letters` has more than 0 elements, then 'NO' is printed and the loop continues. If `y0` and `y1` are both True, 'YES' is printed. The overall state of the program after the execution of the if else block covers all edge cases if `p1len` is 0 or not 0, and the presence of good letters in `t`.***
