Postcondition: ***If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values. If `p1len` is greater than 0 and `y1` is False, then after the if statement, `y0` remains True, `y1` is either False or True based on the conditions met during the loop execution, and all other variables retain their initial values. If `p1len` is greater than 0 and `y1` is True, then `y0` remains True, `y1` remains True, and all other variables retain their initial values.***
