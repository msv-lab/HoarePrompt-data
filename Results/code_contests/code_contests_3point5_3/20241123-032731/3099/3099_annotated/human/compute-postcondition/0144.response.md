Postcondition: ***`q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is either True or False, and `n` is incremented. If `plen` is not equal to `qlen`, the loop does not execute, and no changes occur. If during the loop execution, the ith element of `p` is '?', and the ith element of `q` is not in the list of good_letters, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and a break statement is encountered. If the ith element of `p` is not equal to the ith element of `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and a break statement is executed. If no conditions are met during the loop execution, 'YES' is printed.***
