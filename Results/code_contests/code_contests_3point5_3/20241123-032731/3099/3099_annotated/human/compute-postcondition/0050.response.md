Postcondition: ***The program has checked each character at index i in strings p and q. If p[i] is '?', then q[i] is in good_letters. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the program handles all cases where the characters at the corresponding positions in strings p and q meet the specified conditions.***
