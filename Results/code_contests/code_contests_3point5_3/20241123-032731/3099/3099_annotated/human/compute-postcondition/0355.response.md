Output State: **`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the index of the current iteration in the range of `p1len`, `q` is a list or string, `t` is set to `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is set to the sublist of `q` from index `p0len` to the end minus `p1len`, `q` is assigned the user input value, and `qlen` is assigned the length of `q`.**
