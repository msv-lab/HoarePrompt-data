To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions specified in the program logic.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. 

Since the loop body checks the elements at index `i` in `p1` and `qr`, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is equal to '?', the program checks if the corresponding element in `qr` is not in `good_letters`. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks.

2. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is not equal to '?', the program checks if it is not equal to the corresponding element in `qr`. If they differ, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to consider the next element in `p1` and `qr` based on the conditions specified in the program logic.

State: **`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 (incremented from 0)**
