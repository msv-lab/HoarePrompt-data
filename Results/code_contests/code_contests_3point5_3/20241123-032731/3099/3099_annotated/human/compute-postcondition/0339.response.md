Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `q`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the index of the current iteration in the range of `p1len`, `q` is a list or string. If any character in `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?', the program checks if the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If any character in `p1` at index `i` is not equal to the corresponding character in `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The loop will not execute if `p1len` is 0 or less. After the if statement executes, `y1` remains a boolean indicating the match status between `p1` and the reversed version of `q`, and the loop will continue its execution based on the updated value of `y1`.***
