Output State: **`y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `q` is a list or string, `p1[i]` is not equal to '?'. The character at index `i` in `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `qr` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
