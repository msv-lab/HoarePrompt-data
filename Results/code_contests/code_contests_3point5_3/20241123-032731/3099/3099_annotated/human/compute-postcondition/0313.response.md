Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean where True indicates a match between `p1` and `qr`, and False indicates a mismatch. `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `q` is a list or string, and `p1[i]` is not equal to '?'. If the character at index `i` in `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `qr`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios where the program variables are updated based on the conditions met during the execution of the if statement.***
