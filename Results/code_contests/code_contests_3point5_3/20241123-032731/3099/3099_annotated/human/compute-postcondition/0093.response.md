Postcondition: ***`q` is a string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `plen` is the range value for the loop; `y` is a boolean; `i` is less than `plen`. If the character at index `i` in `q` is not in the list `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
