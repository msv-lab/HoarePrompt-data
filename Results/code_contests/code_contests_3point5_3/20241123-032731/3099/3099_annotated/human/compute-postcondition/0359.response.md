Output State: **`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `qr`, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the index of the current iteration in the range of `p1len`, `q` is the user input value, `t` is set to `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0, otherwise `t` is set to the sublist of `q` from index `p0len` to the end minus `p1len`, `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, then 'NO' is printed, and the iteration continues. The program retains the initial conditions of the variables. `y0` is assigned the value True.**
