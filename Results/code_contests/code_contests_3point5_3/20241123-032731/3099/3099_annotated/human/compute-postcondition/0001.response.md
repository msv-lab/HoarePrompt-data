Example Answer: 
A set `good_letters` is created with unique characters from the input string `gls`. The input string `gls` is the only variable affected, and its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string.
Output State: **`gls` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of unique characters from the input string**
