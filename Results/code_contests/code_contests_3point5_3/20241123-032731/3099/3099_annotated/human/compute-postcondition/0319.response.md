Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean indicating the match between `p1` and the reversed version of `q`, `qr`. `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the character at position `i` in `qr` is not in the list of `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited.***
