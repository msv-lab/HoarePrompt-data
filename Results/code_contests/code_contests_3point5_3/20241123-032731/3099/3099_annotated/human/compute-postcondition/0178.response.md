Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `p0`, `p1`, `p1`, `p0len`, `p1len`, `n`, `q`, `y0`, `i` are all input strings or variables as described. `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the part of the string before '*', `p1` is the part of the string after '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0` and is greater than or equal to 1, `p1len` is the length of the reversed `p1` string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is the input string from raw_input(), `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y0` is either True or False based on the condition. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This covers the case when the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in the list of `good_letters`.***
