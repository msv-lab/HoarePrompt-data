Example Answer:
The length of `p1` is calculated using `len(p1)`. The previous values of `p1` and `p1`'s length are known. Therefore, `p1len` will be the length of the reversed `p1` string.
Output State: **gls is the input string, good_letters is a set of unique characters from the input string, p is the input string from raw_input(), plen is the length of the input string p, p0 is the part of the string before '*', p1 is the part of the string after '*', p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string, p0len is the length of p0, p1len is the length of the reversed p1 string**
