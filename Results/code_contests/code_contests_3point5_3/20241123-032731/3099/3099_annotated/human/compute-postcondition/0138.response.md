Postcondition: ***`q` is a string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is either True or False, `n` is incremented, `i` is one more than the previous iteration, and `i` is less than `plen`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken.***
