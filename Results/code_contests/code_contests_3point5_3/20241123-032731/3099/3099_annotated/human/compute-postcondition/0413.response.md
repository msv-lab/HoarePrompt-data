Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is True if `y0` remains True, otherwise `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list where the element at index `i` is not equal to '?'. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all other cases, the program variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
