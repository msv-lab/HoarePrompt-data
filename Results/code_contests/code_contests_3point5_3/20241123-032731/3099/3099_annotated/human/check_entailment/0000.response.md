Correctness: **True**

The program seems to handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly checks if the pattern matches the query strings by replacing '?' with good letters and '*' with any string of bad letters. The logic implemented in the code covers all scenarios mentioned in the problem description, including cases where the '*' character occurs at most once in the pattern. Additionally, the program handles edge cases such as when the length of the query string is not equal to the length of the pattern, or when the pattern is split into two parts for comparison with the query string. The annotations provided also explain the flow of the program and how it ensures that the conditions are met for each query string. Overall, the code appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
