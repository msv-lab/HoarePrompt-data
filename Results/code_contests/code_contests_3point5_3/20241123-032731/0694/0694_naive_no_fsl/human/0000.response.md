Correctness: **False**

The given program does not produce the correct output as per the problem description. The program is supposed to draw a frame with '#' and '.' characters based on the height and width provided. However, the program is printing each character on a new line instead of in the same line to form the frame.

For example, when the input is (3, 4), the expected output should be:

```
####
#..#
####
```

But the program will output:

```
#
#
#
#
.
.
.
#
#
#
#
.
.
.
#
#
#
#
```

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
