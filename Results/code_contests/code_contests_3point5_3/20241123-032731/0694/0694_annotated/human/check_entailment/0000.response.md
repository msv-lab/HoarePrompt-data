Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is supposed to draw a frame of '#' and '.' with a height of H cm and a width of W cm. However, the program does not print the frame correctly.

Issues with the program:
1. The program prints a '#' or '.' character on a new line for each iteration of the inner loop. This will result in the frame being printed as a series of individual characters vertically rather than a complete frame.
2. The program does not maintain the horizontal alignment of characters in each row of the frame.

Example:
Input
3 4

Expected Output
####
#..#
####

Output by the program
#
#
#

This example demonstrates that the program does not output the correct frame as per the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is False.
