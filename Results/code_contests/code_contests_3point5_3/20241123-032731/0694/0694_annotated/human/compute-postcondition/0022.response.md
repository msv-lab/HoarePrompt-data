According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `w`. If `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 1 or `w` is less than 1, which means the loop does not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be greater than 1 and `w` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: If h is greater than 1 and w is greater than or equal to 1**
