According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `j` is already equal to `w`, so no adjustment needed for `j`. However, `i` is not used in the loop, so it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, `i` is equal to `h`**
