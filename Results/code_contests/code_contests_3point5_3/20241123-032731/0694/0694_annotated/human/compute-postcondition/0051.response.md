According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `w`**
