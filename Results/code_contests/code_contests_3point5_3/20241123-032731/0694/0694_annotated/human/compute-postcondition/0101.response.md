According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is less than `w` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is now equal to `w`. 
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, `i` needs to be adjusted**
