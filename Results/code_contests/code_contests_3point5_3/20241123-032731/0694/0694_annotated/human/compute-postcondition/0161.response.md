According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since there is no initial state given, and the loop starts from 0 to `w`, the state needs to be adjusted to `w` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is 0.
State: **`w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0**
