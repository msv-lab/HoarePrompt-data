According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0. Since the loop is based on `j`, to execute one more time `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 1**
