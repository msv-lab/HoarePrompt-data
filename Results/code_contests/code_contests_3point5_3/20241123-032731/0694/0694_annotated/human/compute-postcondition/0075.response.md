According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` by 1. 
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1**
