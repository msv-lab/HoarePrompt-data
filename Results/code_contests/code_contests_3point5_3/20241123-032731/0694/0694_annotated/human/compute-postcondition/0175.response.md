According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 2. Since `j` is less than `w`, the loop will execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 3**
