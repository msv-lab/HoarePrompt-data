Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('#')` simply prints the pound sign '#'. It does not affect the initial state variables `h`, `w`, or `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1**
