Output State: **After the loop executes, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers greater than 0. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. In all other cases, the program prints '.'. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and the initial values of `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are maintained.**
