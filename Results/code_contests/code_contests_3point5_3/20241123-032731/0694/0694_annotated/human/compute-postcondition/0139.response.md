According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, and `j` is less than `w`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is equal to the last value of `w`**
