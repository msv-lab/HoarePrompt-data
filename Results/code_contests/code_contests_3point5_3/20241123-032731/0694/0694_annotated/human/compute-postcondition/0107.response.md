According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, `i` is adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. Thus, `j` should be adjusted to be less than `w`.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is adjusted**
