Postcondition: ***H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is an integer, w is an integer. If h is 0 and w is 0, the code does not affect the variables, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This condition covers the case where both h and w are 0, meeting the if statement's condition, resulting in breaking out of the loop or if statement without modifying any variables.***
