According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is less than w. At the end of the last iteration, H and W are integers between 3 and 300, h is greater than 0, w is greater than 0, j is 2. Since j is 2 and needs to be less than w, j needs to be adjusted to 3 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **H and W are integers between 3 and 300, h is greater than 0, w is greater than 0, j is 3**
