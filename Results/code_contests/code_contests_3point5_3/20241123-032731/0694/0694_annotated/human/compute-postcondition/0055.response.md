According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `w`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w + 1`.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `w + 1**
