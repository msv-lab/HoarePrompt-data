Output State: **If either h is less than or equal to 1 or w is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If both h and w are 0, the loop does not affect the variables. Otherwise, the loop iterates over all values of i from 0 to h - 1 and all values of j from 0 to w - 1. During each iteration, the program prints '#' if i is 0 or i is equal to h - 1 or j is 0 or j is equal to w - 1, otherwise it prints '.'. After the loop executes, h and w remain integers, with the appropriate conditions checked for the loop to run effectively.**
