According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is less than `w`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **h is greater than 1, w is greater than or equal to 1, j is less than w+1**
