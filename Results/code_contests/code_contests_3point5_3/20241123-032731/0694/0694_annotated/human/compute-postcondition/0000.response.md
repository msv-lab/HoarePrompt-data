Example Answer:
`h` and `w` are assigned values from the input after splitting based on space. The input is converted to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. As the values of `H` and `W` are between 3 and 300, the output state is: H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer.
Output State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer**
