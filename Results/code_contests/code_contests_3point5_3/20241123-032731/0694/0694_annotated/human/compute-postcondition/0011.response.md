According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is less than w. At the end of the last iteration, h and W are integers between 3 and 300, h is greater than 0, w is greater than 0, j is 0. Since j is 0, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is j, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **H and W are integers between 3 and 300, h is greater than 0, w is greater than 0, j is 1**
