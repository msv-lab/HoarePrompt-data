According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, and `i` is adjusted. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w + 1`, `i` is adjusted**
