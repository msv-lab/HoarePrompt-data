Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. The program handles all boundary cases of `i` and `j` with respect to `h` and `w` appropriately.***
