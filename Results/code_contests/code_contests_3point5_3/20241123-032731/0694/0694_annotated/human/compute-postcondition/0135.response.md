According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `w`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`**
