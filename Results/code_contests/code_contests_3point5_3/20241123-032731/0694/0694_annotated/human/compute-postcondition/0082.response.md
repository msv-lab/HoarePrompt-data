According to the code, the loop will always execute for all values of `i` from 0 to `h-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, and `w` is greater than 0. No other specific conditions are mentioned that would prevent the loop from executing. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0**
