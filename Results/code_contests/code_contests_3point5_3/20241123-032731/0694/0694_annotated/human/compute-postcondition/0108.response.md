Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints a `#` symbol to the output. It does not affect the state of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is adjusted.
Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is adjusted**
