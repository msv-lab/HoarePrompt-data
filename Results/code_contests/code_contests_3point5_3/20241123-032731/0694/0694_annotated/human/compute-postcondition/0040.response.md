According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `w`. If `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `h` needs to be greater than 1 and `w` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1**
