According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w`. Additionally, the conditions for printing '#' or '.' are based on `i`, `j`, `h`, and `w`. Since the loop is controlled by `j` and `w`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **h is greater than 1, w is greater than or equal to 0, j is less than w + 1**
