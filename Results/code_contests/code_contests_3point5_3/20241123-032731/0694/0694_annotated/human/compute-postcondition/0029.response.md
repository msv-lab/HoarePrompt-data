According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **h is greater than 1, w is greater than or equal to 1, j is less than w**
