Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `w`. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. The loop will execute for all values of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. If either `h` is less than or equal to 1 or `w` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.**
