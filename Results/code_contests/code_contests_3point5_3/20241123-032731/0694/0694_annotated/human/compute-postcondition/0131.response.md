According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `w-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is `w - 1`. To execute one more time, the loop should increment `j` by 1 so that `j` becomes `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is `w`**
