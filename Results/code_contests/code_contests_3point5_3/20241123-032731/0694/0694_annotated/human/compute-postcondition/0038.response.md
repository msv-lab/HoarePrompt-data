Output State: If h is greater than 1 and w is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will iterate w times. For each iteration, if i is 0 or h - 1, or if j is 0 or w - 1, the program will print '#'. Otherwise, the program will print '.'. If h is less than or equal to 1 or w is less than 1, the loop will not execute.
Output State: **If h is greater than 1 and w is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will print a grid of '#' and '.' based on the conditions. If h is less than or equal to 1 or w is less than 1, the loop will not execute.**
