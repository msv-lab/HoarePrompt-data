According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` should be equal to the current value of `h`.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, `i` is equal to `h`**
