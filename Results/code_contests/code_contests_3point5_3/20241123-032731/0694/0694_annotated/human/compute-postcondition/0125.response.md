According to the code, the loop can execute if `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` is greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute. Additionally, `j` starts from 0. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
