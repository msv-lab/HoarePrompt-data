Output State: **If w is greater than 0, after the loop execution, j will be equal to w - 1. The loop prints '#' if i is 0, j is 0, i is h - 1, or j is w - 1; otherwise, it prints '.'. The loop will not execute if w is less than or equal to 0. If h is equal to 0 or w is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
