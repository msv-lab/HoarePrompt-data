Output State: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `w-1`. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints a period '.'. The loop will always execute, printing either '#' or '.' based on the conditions.
