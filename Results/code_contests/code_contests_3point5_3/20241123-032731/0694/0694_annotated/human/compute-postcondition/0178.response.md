According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w` and `h`. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, if w is greater than 0, after the loop execution, j will be equal to w - 1. If the loop is to be executed one more time, the conditions for printing '#' must not be met (i is 0, j is 0, i is h - 1, or j is w - 1). Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the j should be adjusted to a value other than w - 1.
State: **If w is greater than 0, after the loop execution, j will be equal to w - 2**
