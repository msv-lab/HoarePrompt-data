According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `w+1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `w`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `w`**
