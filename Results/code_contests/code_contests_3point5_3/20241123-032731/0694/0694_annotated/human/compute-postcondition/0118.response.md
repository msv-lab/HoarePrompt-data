According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 1, `w` remains greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w`, and `i` is adjusted accordingly. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration.
State: **`h` remains greater than 1, `w` remains greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
