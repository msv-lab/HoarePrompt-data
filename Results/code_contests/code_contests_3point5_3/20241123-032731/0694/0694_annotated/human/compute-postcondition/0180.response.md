According to the code, the loop will execute indefinitely as it is a `while True` loop. The loop body is not provided, but we know that the loop will continue as long as `while True` is true. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition that `while True` remains true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No adjustments needed as the loop is a while True loop**.
