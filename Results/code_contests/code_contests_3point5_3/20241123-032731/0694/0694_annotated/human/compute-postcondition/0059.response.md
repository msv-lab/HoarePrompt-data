Output State: 
If `h` is less than or equal to 1 or `w` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, the loop will iterate over all values of `i` from 0 to `h - 1` and all values of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. The program will print '#' if `i` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is 0 or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, otherwise it will print '.'. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the loop does not affect the variables.
