According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. The initial state should be adjusted so that `w` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
