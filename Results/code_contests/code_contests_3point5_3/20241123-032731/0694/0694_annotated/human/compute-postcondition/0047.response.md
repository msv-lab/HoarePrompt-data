According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `w`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
