According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `w - 1`**
