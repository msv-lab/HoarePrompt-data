According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `w`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is adjusted**
