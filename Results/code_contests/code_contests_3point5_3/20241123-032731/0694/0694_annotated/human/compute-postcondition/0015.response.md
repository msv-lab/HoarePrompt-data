According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `H` and `W` are integers between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. Since `j` is less than `w`, no adjustments need to be made to the existing states for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **H and W are integers between 3 and 300, h is greater than 0, w is greater than 0, j is 2**
