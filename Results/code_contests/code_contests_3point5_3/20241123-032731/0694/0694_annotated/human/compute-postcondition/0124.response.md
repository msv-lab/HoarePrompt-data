According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `h`. If `h` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `h` and `w` are assigned values from the input split by space. So for the loop to execute, `h` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is assigned a value from the input split by space**
