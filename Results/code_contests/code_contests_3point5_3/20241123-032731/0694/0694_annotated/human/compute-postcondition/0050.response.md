Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. This covers all possible edge cases where `i` or `j` are at the boundaries of the given dimensions `h` and `w` as well as when they are not at the boundaries.***
