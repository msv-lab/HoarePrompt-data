Output State: **If either h is less than or equal to 1 or w is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If both h and w are 0, the loop does not affect the variables. Otherwise, the loop will iterate over all values of i from 0 to h - 1 and all values of j from 0 to w - 1. The program will print '#' if i is 0, i is equal to h - 1, j is 0, or j is equal to w - 1; otherwise, it will print '.'. After the loop executes, h and w will still be integers, and the conditions for the loop to continue running effectively are checked.**
