Output State: 
If `w` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute at all. If `h` is 1, the loop will print '#' for all values of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. For all other values of `h` and `w`, the loop will print '.' for all values of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`, except when `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, where the loop will print '#'. 
After the loop executes, `h` remains greater than 1, `w` remains greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w`, and `i` is adjusted accordingly.
