According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1 since it needs to be increased to continue the loop. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 1**
