According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `h`. If `h` is greater than 0, the loop will run. Before the loop starts, you need to adjust the state such that `H` and `W` are integers in the range 3 to 300, `h` is an integer greater than 0, and `w` is an integer.
State: **`H` is an integer between 3 and 300, `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer**
