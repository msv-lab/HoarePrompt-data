Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a period '.' to the console but does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is adjusted.
Output State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is adjusted**
