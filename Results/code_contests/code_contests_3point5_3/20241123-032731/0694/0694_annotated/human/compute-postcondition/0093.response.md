According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `w` exclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. 
State: **h is greater than 1, w is greater than or equal to 0, j is less than w**
