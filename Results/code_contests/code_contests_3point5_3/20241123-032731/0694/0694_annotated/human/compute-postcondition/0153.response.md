According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers greater than 0, and `j` is less than `w - 1`. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `w - 1` but needs to be increased by 1**
