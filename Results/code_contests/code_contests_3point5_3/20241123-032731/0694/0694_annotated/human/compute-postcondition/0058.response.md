According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and all other states remain the same.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is 1**
