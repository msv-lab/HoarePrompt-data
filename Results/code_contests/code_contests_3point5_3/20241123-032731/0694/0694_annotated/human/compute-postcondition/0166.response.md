Postcondition: ***`w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0. If i is equal to 0 or j is equal to 0 or i is equal to h - 1 or j is equal to w - 1, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. In all cases, the variables `w` and `j` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
