Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely until explicitly terminated. Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration needs to be repeated for the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: Output State: `h` is less than or equal to 1 or `w` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, the loop will iterate over all values of `i` from 0 to `h - 1` and all values of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. The program will print '#' if `i` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is 0 or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, otherwise it will print '.'. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the loop does not affect the variables.**
