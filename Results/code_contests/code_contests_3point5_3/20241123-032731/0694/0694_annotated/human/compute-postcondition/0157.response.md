According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers greater than 0. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is `h - 1` or `j` is `w - 1`, '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. `j` is less than `w` but needs to be increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers greater than 0, `j` is increased by 1**
