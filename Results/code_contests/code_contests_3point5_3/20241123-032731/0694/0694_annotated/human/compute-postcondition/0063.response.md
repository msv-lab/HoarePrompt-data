Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, `h` and `w` are integers. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the loop does not affect the variables. If either `h` is less than or equal to 1 or `w` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop iterates over all values of `i` from 0 to `h - 1` and all values of `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. During each iteration, the program prints '#' if `i` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is 0 or `j` is equal to `w - 1', otherwise it prints '.'.***
