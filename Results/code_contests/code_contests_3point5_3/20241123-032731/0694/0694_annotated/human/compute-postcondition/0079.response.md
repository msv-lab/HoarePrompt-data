According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1. Since there are no conditions related to `h` or `i` that affect the loop, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`**
