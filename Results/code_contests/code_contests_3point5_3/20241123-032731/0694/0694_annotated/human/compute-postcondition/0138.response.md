Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`. If `i` is equal to 0 or `j` is equal to 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the code prints '#' to the console. Otherwise, the code prints '.' to the console. The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
