According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0**
