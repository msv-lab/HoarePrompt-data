According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `h`. If `i` is not 0, `h - 1`, or `w - 1`, the loop does not execute. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w`, and `i` is either 0, `h - 1`, or `w - 1`, and `j` is either 0 or `w - 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted accordingly to satisfy the condition for the loop to execute.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w`, and `i` needs to be adjusted to satisfy the condition for the loop to execute one more time**
