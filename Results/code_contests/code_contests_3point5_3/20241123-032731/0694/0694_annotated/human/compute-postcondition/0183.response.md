Functionality: The function `func` reads input from the user until the user enters 0 for both height (h) and width (w). For each pair of height and width entered, it prints a pattern of '#' for the border and '.' for the interior of a rectangle defined by the height and width. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value. If either the height or width is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute.
