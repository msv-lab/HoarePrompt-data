Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly draw the frame based on the input dimensions. Instead of printing the entire row of '#' or '.', the program prints each character in a new line. This results in the frame not being formed correctly. 

For example, for the input 3 4, the expected output should be:
```
####
#..#
####
```
But the program will output:
```
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
``` 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
