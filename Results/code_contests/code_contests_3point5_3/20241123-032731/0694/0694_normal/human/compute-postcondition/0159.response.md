Output State: **If w is greater than 0 and h is greater than 2, the loop will execute. After each iteration, i is 0, h is greater than 2, w remains the same, and j increments by 1. If i is 0, j is 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, a '.' is printed. If w is 0 or h is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute.**
