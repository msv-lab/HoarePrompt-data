Example Answer:
The variables `h` and `w` are assigned values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by whitespace. Since the constraints are given as 3 <= h <= 300 and 3 <= w <= 300, the values of `h` and `w` will be within these ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: h and w are integers satisfying 3 <= h <= 300 and 3 <= w <= 300.
Output State: **h and w are integers satisfying 3 <= h <= 300 and 3 <= w <= 300**
