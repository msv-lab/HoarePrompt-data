Postcondition: ***`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `h-1`, `j` is equal to `w-1`. If `h` is equal to 0 and `w` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to the initial state variables.***
