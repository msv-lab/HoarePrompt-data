According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1. Since `j` being 1 is less than `w`, the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 2**
