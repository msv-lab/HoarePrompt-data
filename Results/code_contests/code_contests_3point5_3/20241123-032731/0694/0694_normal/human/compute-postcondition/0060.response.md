According to the code, the loop will keep executing indefinitely since it is a `while True` loop. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions that would allow the loop to continue need to be met. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `h-1`, `j` is equal to `w-1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions need to be met:
- `w` needs to be greater than 0 to satisfy the loop condition.
- `h` and `w` cannot both be 0, so `h` and `w` need to be adjusted accordingly to continue the loop.
- Depending on the values of `h` and `w`, `i` and `j` need to be adjusted accordingly to meet the loop conditions.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `h-1`, `j` is equal to `w-1`**
