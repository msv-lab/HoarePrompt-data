Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 or `j` is equal to 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. In all cases, `i` remains equal to `h - 1` and `j` remains equal to 1 after the execution of the if-else block.***
