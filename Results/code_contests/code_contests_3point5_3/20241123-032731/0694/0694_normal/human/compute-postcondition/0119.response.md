Output State: 

If `h` or `w` are less than or equal to 2, the loop will not execute as `i` and `j` will not meet the loop condition. In this case, no output will be printed, and `h` and `w` will remain unchanged. If `h` is equal to 0 and `w` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, for each value of `i` from 0 to `h`, and each value of `j` from 0 to `w`, the program prints '#' if either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h-1`, or `j` is equal to `w-1`, otherwise it prints '.'. After the loop execution, `i` remains equal to `h-1`, and `j` is equal to `w-1`.

**If h or w are less than or equal to 2, the loop will not execute. If h is equal to 0 and w is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program prints '#' for i=0, j=0, i=h-1, j=w-1, and '.' otherwise. After the loop, i is h-1 and j is w-1.**
