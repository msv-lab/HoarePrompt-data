According to the code, the loop will execute if w is greater than 0 and h is greater than 2. After each iteration, i is 0, h is greater than 2, w remains the same, and j increments by 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to: `w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
