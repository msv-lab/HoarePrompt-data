According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `h` is greater than 0. In this case, the loop starts at 0 and goes up to `h-1`. Since the loop is inclusive of 0, the loop will execute even if `h` is 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than or equal to 0 and `w` remains unchanged.
State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 0, `w` remains unchanged**
