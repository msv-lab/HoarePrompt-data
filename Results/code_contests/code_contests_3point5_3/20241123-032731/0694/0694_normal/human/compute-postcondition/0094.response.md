Output State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If any of the conditions i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1 are true, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. After the execution of the if-else block, the program outputs '#' if any of the conditions i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1 are true; otherwise, it outputs '.'. `j` is less than `w`. `j` is adjusted to be one more than its previous value.**
