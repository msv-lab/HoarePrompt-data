According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. Since `j` is 0, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
