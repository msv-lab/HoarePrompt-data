According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 0 to `w-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers. If either `i` equals 0, `j` equals 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration should be less than `w-1`. So, the state that needs adjustment is:
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers, `j` is less than `w-1**`.
