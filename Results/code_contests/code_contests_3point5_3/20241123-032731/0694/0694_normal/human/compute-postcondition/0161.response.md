According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w` and `j`. Since the range starts from 0 and goes up to but not including `w`, if `w` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` being 1, `h` being greater than 2, and `j` being 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `w` is at least 1 and `j` is 0.
State: **`i` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 0**
