According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `h-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `h-1`, which means `i` should be equal to `h-2`. Also, since `j` should be less than `w-1` for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w-1`, which means `j` should be equal to `w-2`.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h-2`, `j` is equal to `w-2`**
