According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`, so `j` should be adjusted to 3.
State: **`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 3, `i` is incremented by 1**
