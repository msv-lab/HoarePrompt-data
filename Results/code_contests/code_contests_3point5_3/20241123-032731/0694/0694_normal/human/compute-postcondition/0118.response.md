According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` can be any value between 0 and `h - 1` inclusive. Additionally, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0. If `w` is 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `i` is less than `h - 1`, `j` should be adjusted to `j` is 0, and `w` should be adjusted to `w` is greater than 0.
State: **If `i` is less than `h - 1`, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0**
