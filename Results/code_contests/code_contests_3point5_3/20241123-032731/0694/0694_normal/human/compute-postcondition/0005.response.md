According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. The variable `j` is used for iteration over the range(0, w), so `j` needs to be initialized to 0. For the loop to execute, `h` needs to be greater than or equal to 0, `w` needs to be greater than 0, and `j` needs to be 0.
State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
