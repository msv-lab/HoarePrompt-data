According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h-1`, `j` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h-1`, `j` is 1**
