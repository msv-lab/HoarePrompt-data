According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than or equal to 0, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. Since `j` is 0 and needs to be less than `w` for the loop to continue, `j` should be adjusted to be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
