According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`, in this case, `j` should be 2.
State: **`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 2**
