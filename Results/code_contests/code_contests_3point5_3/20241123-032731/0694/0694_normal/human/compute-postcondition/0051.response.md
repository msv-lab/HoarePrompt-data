According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `j`, `i` are integers. If `i` equals 0 or `j` equals 0 or `i` equals `h - 1` or `j` equals `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. To ensure the correct printing of '#' and '.' in the next iteration, the states need to be adjusted based on the boundaries of `h` and `w` as well as the values of `i` and `j`.

To execute the loop one more time, the adjustments needed are:
- If `j` equals `w - 1`, then `j` should be reset to 0 for the next iteration.
- If `j` is not at the boundary of `w`, no other adjustments are necessary.

State: **`h`, `w`, `j`, `i` are integers. If `i` equals 0 or `j` equals 0 or `i` equals `h - 1` or `j` equals `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. Additionally, `j` is reset to 0 if `j` equals `w - 1`.**
