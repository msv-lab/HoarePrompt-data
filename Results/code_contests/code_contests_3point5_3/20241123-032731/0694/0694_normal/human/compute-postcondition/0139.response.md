According to the loop statement, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is less than `w`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **i is 0, h is greater than 2, w is greater than 0, j is 2**
