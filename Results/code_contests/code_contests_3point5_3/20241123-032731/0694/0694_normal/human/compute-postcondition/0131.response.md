According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **i is 0, h is greater than 2, w is greater than 0, j is 1**
