According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `j`, and `i` are integers. If the loop is to execute one more time, `j` should not be equal to `w - 1` to continue iterating. If `j` is equal to `w - 1`, it should be reset to 0 to satisfy the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`h`, `w`, `j`, `i` are integers. `j` is not equal to `w - 1`.**
