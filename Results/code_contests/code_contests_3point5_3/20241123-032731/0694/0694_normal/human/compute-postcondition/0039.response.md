Output State: **After the loop executes, `h` remains a non-negative integer, `w` remains a positive integer, `j` is equal to `w-1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.**
