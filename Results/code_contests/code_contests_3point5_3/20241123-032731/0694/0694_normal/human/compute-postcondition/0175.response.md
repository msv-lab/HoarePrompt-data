According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, and `j` is 2. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `w`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 for the loop to run one more time.
State: **`i` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 3**
