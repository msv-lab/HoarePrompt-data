Output State: **After the loop executes, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `h-1`, `j` is equal to `w-1`. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h-1`, or `j` is equal to `w-1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the program breaks out of the loop. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.**
