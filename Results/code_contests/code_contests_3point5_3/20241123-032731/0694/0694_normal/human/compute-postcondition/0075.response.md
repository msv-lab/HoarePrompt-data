According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 or `j` is equal to 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. In all cases, `i` remains equal to `h - 1` and `j` remains equal to 1 after the execution of the if-else block. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `w - 1.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `w - 1`, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, `j` remains equal to 1**
