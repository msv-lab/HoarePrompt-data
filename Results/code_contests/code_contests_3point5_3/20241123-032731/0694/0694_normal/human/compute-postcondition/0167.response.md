According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 0. Since `j` is 0, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
