According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `i` from 0 to `h`. If `h` or `w` are less than or equal to 2, the loop will not execute. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If any of the following conditions are true: i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions for the loop to continue. If the loop is to execute one more time, the condition `i == h - 1` must not be met. So the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `h - 1` to ensure the loop can continue.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers, `i` is less than `h - 1**.
