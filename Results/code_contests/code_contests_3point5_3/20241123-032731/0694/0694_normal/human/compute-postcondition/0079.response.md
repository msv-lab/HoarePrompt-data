According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. So for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `w` and any of the conditions for '#' to be printed are not met.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. `j` is less than `w`**.
