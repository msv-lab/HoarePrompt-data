According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `h`. If `i` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 or `h` is 1, which means the loop will not execute. `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and `i` will remain the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to a value greater than 0 and `h` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 1.
State: **`j` is equal to `w - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 1**
