Output State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h-1`, or `j` is equal to `w-1`, then a '#' is printed. Otherwise, a '.' is printed. After the loop execution, `i` remains equal to `h-1`, and `j` is equal to `w-1`**. If either `w` is 0, the loop won't execute, and the output will be empty.
