According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `w` is positive. The loop will iterate `w` times starting from index 0. Before the loop starts, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is a non-negative integer, `i` is incremented by 1. In order for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be set as 0.
State: **`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
