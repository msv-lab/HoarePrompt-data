According to the code, the loop can execute if `w` is a positive integer. So, the states need to be adjusted such that `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `h-1` and `j` is equal to `w-1` does not ensure the loop will execute, so these states need to be updated. 
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h-1`, `j` is 0**
