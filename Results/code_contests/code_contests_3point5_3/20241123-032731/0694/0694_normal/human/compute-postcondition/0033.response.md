According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
