Output State: **The loop iterates over the range of values from 0 to `w`, printing '#' if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and '.' otherwise. After the loop executes, `j` will be equal to `w - 1`, and `i` will remain the same. If `i` is 0 or `h` is 1, the loop will not execute, and no characters will be printed.**
