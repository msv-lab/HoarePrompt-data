According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
