Postcondition: ***`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If any of the following conditions are true: i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. `j` is less than `w`. After the execution of the if-else block, the program outputs '#' if any of the conditions i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1 are true; otherwise, it outputs '.'. `j` remains less than `w`, ensuring that the loop can execute another iteration.***
