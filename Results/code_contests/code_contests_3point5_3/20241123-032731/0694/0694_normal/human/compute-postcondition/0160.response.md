According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w` and `h`. If `w` is greater than 0 and `h` is greater than 2, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, i is 0, h is greater than 2, w remains the same, and j increments by 1. If i is 0, j is 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, a '.' is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be incremented by 1
- `j` should be reset to 0
- `h` should remain greater than 2

State: **`i` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` remains the same, `j` is 0**
