According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are integers. If any of the conditions i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1 are true, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: *`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If any of the following conditions are true: i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. `j` is less than `w`.
