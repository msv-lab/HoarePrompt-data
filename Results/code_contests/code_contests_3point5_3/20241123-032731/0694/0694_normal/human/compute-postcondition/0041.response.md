According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w` and `j`. Since the loop range is from 0 to `w`, it will execute as long as `w` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `w-1`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 0. Additionally, since `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is less than `h`, `i` needs to be set to 0. 
State: **`h` remains a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `i` is 0**
