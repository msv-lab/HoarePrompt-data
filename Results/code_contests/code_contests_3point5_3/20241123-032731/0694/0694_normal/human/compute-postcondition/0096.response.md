Postcondition: ***h, w, i, j are integers. If any of the conditions i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1 are true, the program prints '#' and the output is '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.' and the output is '.'. After the execution of the if-else block, the program outputs '#' if any of the conditions i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1 are true; otherwise, it outputs '.'. j is less than w, and j is updated to be one more than its previous value.***
