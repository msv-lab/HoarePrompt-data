According to the code, the loop can execute if `h` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is `h-1`, which meets the condition for the loop to execute. However, `j` is not involved in the loop condition and can remain as is. Since `w` is a positive integer, it does not affect the loop condition either. If `h` is 0, the loop will not execute, so `h` should be greater than 0 for the loop to run.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `h-1`, `j` is equal to `w-1**.
