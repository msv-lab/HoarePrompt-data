According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers, and `j` is less than `w-1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers, `j` is less than `w`.**
