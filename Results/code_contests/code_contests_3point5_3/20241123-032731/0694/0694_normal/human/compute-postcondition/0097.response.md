According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to be one more than its previous value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **h, w, i, j are integers. j is updated to be one more than its previous value.**
