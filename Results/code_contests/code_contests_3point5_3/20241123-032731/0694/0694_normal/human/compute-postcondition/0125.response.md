According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `w` is greater than 0. Since `w` is 0 initially, it needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. Additionally, the loop requires the value of `j` to be within the range of 0 to `w`, so `j` should be set to 0. 
State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
