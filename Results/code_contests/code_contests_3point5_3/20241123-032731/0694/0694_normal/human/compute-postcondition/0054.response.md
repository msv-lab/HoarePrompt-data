Postcondition: ***`h`, `w`, `j`, `i` are integers. If `i` equals 0 or `j` equals 0 or `i` equals `h - 1` or `j` equals `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. Additionally, `j` is reset to 0 if `j` equals `w - 1`. After the execution of the code fragment, the program will print '#' if any of the conditions `i == 0`, `j == 0`, `i == h - 1`, or `j == w - 1` are true. If none of these conditions are met, the program prints '.'. Moreover, if `j` was equal to `w - 1`, it is reset to 0 regardless of the printed character.***
