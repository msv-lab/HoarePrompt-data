According to the code, the loop will execute infinitely as it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions inside the loop (`i == 0`, `j == 0`, `i == h - 1`, `j == w - 1`) should not be met. Additionally, `h` must be greater than 2 and `w` must be at least 1. 

Based on the given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is equal to the number of iterations, which means `i` should be adjusted to be incremented by 1.
- `h` is greater than 2, so no adjustment is needed.
- `w` is at least 1, so no adjustment is needed.
- `j` is either 0 or equal to the number of iterations, which means `j` should also be adjusted to be incremented by 1.

State: **After the loop executes, `i` is equal to the number of iterations + 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, and `j` is either 1 or equal to the number of iterations + 1**
