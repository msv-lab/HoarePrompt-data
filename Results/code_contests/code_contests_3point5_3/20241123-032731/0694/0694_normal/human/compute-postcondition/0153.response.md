According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `w`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
