According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` and `w` are already integers greater than 0, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be initialized to 0 instead of `w-2`.
State: **`h` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h-2`, `j` is 0**
