Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After the loop executes, `i` is equal to the number of iterations, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, and `j` is either 0 or equal to the number of iterations. If any of the conditions (i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1) are true, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. If h is less than or equal to 2 or w is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no output is produced. If either h or w is 0, the loop will not execute and no output will be produced.
