Output State: **`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is a non-negative integer. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. The loop will always execute for the given range of `w`.**
