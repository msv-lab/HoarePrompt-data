According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is less than `w`**
