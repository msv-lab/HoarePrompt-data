Functionality: The function `func` reads pairs of integers `h` and `w` from user input until `h` and `w` are both 0. For each pair, it prints a grid of '#' and '.' characters based on the conditions `i == 0`, `j == 0`, `i == h - 1`, and `j == w - 1`. The function operates assuming `h` and `w` are integers in the range 3 to 300. If `h` is less than or equal to 2 or `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no output is produced. If either `h` or `w` is 0, the loop will not execute and no output will be produced. The function does not explicitly return any value.
