Postcondition: ***`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is either 0, `h - 1`, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0, and the condition `(i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1)` is true, then print '#'. Otherwise, when `i` is between 1 and `h - 2`, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0, then print '.'. This encompasses all possible cases for the given program fragment.***
