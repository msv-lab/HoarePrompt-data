Output State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If any of the following conditions are true: i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, j == w - 1, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. The loop will execute for each value of j from 0 to w. If h or w are less than or equal to 2, the loop will not execute as i and j will not meet the loop condition.**
