According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. Since `j` is less than `w`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **i is 0, h is greater than 2, w is greater than 0, j is 1**
