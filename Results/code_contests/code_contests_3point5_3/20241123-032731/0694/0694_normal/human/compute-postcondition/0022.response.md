According to the code, the loop will always execute for the given range of `w`. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, and `j` is a non-negative integer. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue iterating through the range of `h`. Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:
State: **`h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer, `j` is a non-negative integer, `i` is incremented by 1**
