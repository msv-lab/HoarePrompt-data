According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. In the given state before the loop starts, `i` is less than `h - 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `h` and `w` are integers, `i` is less than `h - 1`, and `j` is 0.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers, `i` is less than `h - 1, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0**
