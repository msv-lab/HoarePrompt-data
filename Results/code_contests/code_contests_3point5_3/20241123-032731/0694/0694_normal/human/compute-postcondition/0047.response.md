According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w` are integers, `j` is 0, `i` is 0. Since `j` is 0 and `w` is an integer, the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied. Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers, `j` is 0, `i` is 0**
