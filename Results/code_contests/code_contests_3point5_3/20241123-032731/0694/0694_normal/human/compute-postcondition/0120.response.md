Since the loop condition is `while True`, the loop will execute indefinitely until a break statement is encountered. Therefore, the program state needs to be adjusted for the next iteration.

According to the code, the loop will only execute if `h` and `w` are both greater than 2. If either `h` or `w` is less than or equal to 2, the loop will not execute. If `h` is equal to 0 and `w` is equal to 0, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` and `w` both need to be greater than 2. Additionally, if `h` is equal to 0 and `w` is equal to 0, the program will break out of the loop.

State: **If `h` and `w` are greater than 2, the loop will execute. If `h` is equal to 0 and `w` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop.**
