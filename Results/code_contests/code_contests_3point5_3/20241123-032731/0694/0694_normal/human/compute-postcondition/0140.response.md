Output State: **If w is 0 or h is less than or equal to 2, the loop will not execute. If the loop executes, after each iteration, i remains 0, h remains greater than 2, w remains the same, and j increments by 1. The loop will print '#' if i is 0, j is 0, i is h - 1, or j is w - 1; otherwise, it will print '.'.**
