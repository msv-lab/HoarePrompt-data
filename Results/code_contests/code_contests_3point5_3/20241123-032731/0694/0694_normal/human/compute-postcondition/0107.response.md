According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is either 0, `h - 1`, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0, and the condition `(i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1)` is true, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, when `i` is between 1 and `h - 2`, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0, then '.' is printed.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `j < w`.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers**
