According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `h` is greater than 2 and `w` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, and `j` is either 0 or equal to the number of iterations. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 2, `h` is greater than 2, `w` is at least 1, `j` is either 0 or equal to the number of iterations**
