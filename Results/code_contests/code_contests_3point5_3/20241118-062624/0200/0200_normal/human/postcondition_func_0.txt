The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list in reverse order, updating calculations based on the elements and their adjacent elements. The final result `ans` is printed, which is calculated using a specific formula involving the elements, their counts, and the sum of elements. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
