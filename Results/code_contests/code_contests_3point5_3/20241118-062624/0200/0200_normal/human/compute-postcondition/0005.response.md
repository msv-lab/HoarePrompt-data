According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to 0, so it will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9], `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
