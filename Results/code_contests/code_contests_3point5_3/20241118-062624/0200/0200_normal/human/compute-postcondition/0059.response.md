Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9], `cnt` is increased by the count of occurrences of a[i] - 1 in m, `diff` is updated by adding (a[i] - 1) multiplied by its count in m, `ans` is updated by subtracting sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt), `sm` is updated by adding a[i], `m` is updated such that m[a[i]] = 1**
