Example Answer: 
The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9], `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, and `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9], `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, and `ans` is 0**
