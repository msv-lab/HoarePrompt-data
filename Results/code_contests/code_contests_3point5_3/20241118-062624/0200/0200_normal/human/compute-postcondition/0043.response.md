Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9], `ans` is updated based on the formula given, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` including the newly added element, `diff` is calculated as mentioned, `cnt` is increased by m[a[i] - 1] if a[i] - 1 is in m, `m` is updated with the count of occurrences of each element in `a`. If a[i] is already in m, m[a[i]] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, m[a[i]] is set to 1.***
