According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `ans` is updated, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` including the newly added element, `diff` is calculated, `cnt` is increased, and `m` is updated based on the given conditions. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since the loop is iterating from `n - 1` to 0, `i` should be adjusted to `n - 2` to continue the iteration.
2. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9], `ans` is updated based on the formula given, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` including the newly added element, `diff` is calculated as mentioned, `cnt` is increased by m[a[i] - 1] if a[i] - 1 is in m, `m` is updated with the count of occurrences of each element in `a`. If a[i] is already in m, m[a[i]] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, m[a[i]] is set to 1, `i` is `n - 2`.
