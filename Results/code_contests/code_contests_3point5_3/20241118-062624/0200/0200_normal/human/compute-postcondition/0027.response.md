According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sm` is updated, `m` dictionary is updated, and `ans` is updated.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers in the range [1, 10^9].
- `sm` should be updated based on the changes made in the loop body.
- The dictionary `m` should be updated based on the changes made in the loop body.
- `ans` should be updated based on the changes made in the loop body.

State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9], sm is updated, m is updated, ans is updated**
