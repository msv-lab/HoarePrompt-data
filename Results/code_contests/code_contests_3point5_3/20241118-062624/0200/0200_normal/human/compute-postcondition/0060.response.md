Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9]. `cnt` is increased by the count of occurrences of a[i] - 1 in m. `diff` is updated by adding (a[i] - 1) multiplied by its count in m. `ans` is updated by subtracting sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt). `sm` is updated by adding a[i]. If a[i] is already in m, the count of a[i] in m is incremented by 1. Otherwise, a new entry for a[i] is added in m with a count of 1.***
