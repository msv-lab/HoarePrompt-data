Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9], sm is updated by adding the value of a[i]. In dictionary m, if a[i] is already present, its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is added with a[i] having a count of 1. ans is updated by sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt), where i is n - 1, cnt is the sum of values in dictionary m corresponding to elements in list a, and diff is the sum of the products of each element in list a with their respective values in dictionary m. This ensures that all cases are handled and the program state is accurately described after the execution of the if else block.***
