Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the input values after converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The elements in the list `a` are integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9].
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9]**
