Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in the range [1, 10^9], `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the values of elements in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of values in dictionary `m` corresponding to elements in list `a`, `diff` is the sum of the products of each element in list `a` with their respective values in dictionary `m`, `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i] - 1` and `m[a[i] - 1] to the previous value of `diff` where `diff` is further updated by adding the product of `a[i] - 1` and `m[a[i] - 1] to the previous value of `diff`**
