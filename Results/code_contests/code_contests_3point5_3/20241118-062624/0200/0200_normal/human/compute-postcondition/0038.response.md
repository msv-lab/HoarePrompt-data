Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9]. If a[i] - 1 is in m, cnt is increased by m[a[i] - 1] and diff is updated by multiplying (a[i] - 1) with m[a[i] - 1]. All other variables retain their updated values after the execution of the if statement, considering all edge cases related to the presence of a[i] - 1 in m.***
