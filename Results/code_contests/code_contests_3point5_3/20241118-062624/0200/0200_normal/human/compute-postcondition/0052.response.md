Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9]. If a[i] + 1 is found in m, cnt is increased by the count of occurrences of a[i] + 1 in m, diff is updated by adding (a[i] + 1) multiplied by its count in m. All other variables maintain their initial conditions. The overall state after the if-else block execution considers the scenarios where a[i] + 1 is or isn't present in m, ensuring the proper updating of cnt and diff based on the occurrences of a[i] + 1 in m.***
