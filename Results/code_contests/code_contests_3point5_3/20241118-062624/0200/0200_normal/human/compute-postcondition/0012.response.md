Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9], `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the values of elements in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of values in dictionary `m` corresponding to elements in list `a`, `diff` is the sum of the products of each element in list `a` with their respective values in dictionary `m`. If element at index `i` in list `a` is present in dictionary `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the value associated with that element in dictionary `m` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of the element and its associated value in dictionary `m` to the previous value of `diff`. The program enters the if condition when the element at index `i` in list `a` incremented by 1 is present in dictionary `m`.***
