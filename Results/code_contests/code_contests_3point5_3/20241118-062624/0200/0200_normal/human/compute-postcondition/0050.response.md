Example Answer:
The value of `a[i] + 1` is used to index the `m` list. If the value `a[i] + 1` is present in `m`, then the `cnt` variable is increased by the count of occurrences of `a[i] + 1` in `m`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial conditions.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9], cnt is increased by the count of occurrences of a[i] + 1 in m, diff is updated by adding a[i] multiplied by its count in m, rest of the variables maintain their initial conditions**
