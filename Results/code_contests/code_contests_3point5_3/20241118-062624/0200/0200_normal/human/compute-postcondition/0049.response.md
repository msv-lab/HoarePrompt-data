Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9]. If a[i] is present in m, cnt is increased by the count of occurrences of a[i] in m, diff is updated by adding a[i] multiplied by its count in m. The rest of the variables maintain their initial conditions.***
