Example Answer: 
The value of `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] + 1)` and the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9], cnt is updated by m[a[i] + 1], sm, m, ans, and diff are all retained with their updated values.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9], cnt is updated by m[a[i] + 1], sm, m, ans, and diff are all retained with their updated values**
