Example Answer:
The value of `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`, where `i` is equal to `n - 1`. Since the initial value of `diff` is 0, the new value of `diff` will be `a[n - 1] * m[a[n - 1]]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the values of elements in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of values in dictionary `m` corresponding to elements in list `a`, `diff` is the updated value after the calculation.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the values of elements in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of values in dictionary `m` corresponding to elements in list `a`, `diff` is the updated value after the calculation**
