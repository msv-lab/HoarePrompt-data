Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9], `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the values of elements in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of values in dictionary `m` corresponding to elements in list `a`, `diff` is the sum of the products of each element in list `a` with their respective values in dictionary `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the value associated with `a[i] + 1` in dictionary `m`, `diff` is incremented by the product of `a[i] + 1` and `m[a[i] + 1`**
