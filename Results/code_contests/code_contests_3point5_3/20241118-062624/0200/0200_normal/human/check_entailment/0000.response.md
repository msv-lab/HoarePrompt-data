Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n. 
- It iterates through the list in reverse order, updating calculations based on the elements and their adjacent elements. 
- The final result `ans` is calculated using a specific formula involving the elements, their counts, and the sum of elements. 
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for the given examples.
