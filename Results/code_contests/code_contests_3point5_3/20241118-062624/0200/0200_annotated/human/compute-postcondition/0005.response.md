According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop is iterating from `n - 1` down to 0, the loop will execute `n` times. 

For the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input values after splitting them, `sm` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
