According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, all initial conditions remain satisfied and `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is already a key in `m`, then the corresponding value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[i]` is added as a new key in `m` with the value of 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` should be adjusted so that `i` is greater than or equal to -1 at the next iteration.
- `sm` should be updated with the addition of `a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` is already a key in `m`, then the corresponding value should be incremented by 1. If not, `a[i]` should be added as a new key in `m` with the value of 1.

State: **All initial conditions remain satisfied. `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is already a key in `m`, then the corresponding value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[i]` is added as a new key in `m` with the value of 1.**
