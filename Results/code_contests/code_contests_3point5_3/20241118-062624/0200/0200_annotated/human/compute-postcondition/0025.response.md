Example Answer: 
`m[a[i]]` is updated to 1 by assigning the value 1 to the key `a[i]` in dictionary m. The previous state of `m` is unknown, and `a[i]` is not found in `m`, so a new key `a[i]` is added to `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, and a new key `a[i]` with value 1 is added to `m`.
Output State: **`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, and a new key `a[i]` with value 1 is added to `m`**
