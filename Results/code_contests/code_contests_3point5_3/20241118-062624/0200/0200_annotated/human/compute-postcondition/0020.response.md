Output State: **For the given range of `n`, `a`, and `m`, after the execution of the if statement, if `a[i] - 1` exists in set `m`, `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1` to its previous value. All initial conditions remain satisfied. Finally, `ans` is updated by subtracting `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**
