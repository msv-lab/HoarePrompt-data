Output State: *`a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries with updated values, `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]` if `a[i] - 1` is present in `m`, `diff` is updated to include the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]` plus `(a[i]) * m[a[i]] + (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1)` if `a[i] - 1` is present in `m, `sm` are integers, and `i` is still within the range of n - 1 to 1, and `ans` is updated by subtracting `diff` and `a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from `sm`.
