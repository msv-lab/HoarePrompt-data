According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `n - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `a[i]` and `m` have been updated, `cnt`, `diff`, `sm` are integers. The `ans` has been updated based on the described calculation. To execute one more time, the loop needs to adjust the state such that `i` is within the range of `n - 1` to `1`.

State: **`a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries with updated values, `cnt`, `diff`, `sm` are integers, i is within the range of n - 1 to 1**
