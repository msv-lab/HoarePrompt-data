Example Answer:
`diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. The initial value of `diff` is 0, the values of `a[i]` and `m` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `sm` is updated based on the values of `a[i]` and `m`, `cnt` is increased based on the value of `a[i]` in `m`, `diff` is the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`.
Output State: **`sm` is updated based on the values of `a[i]` and `m`, `cnt` is increased based on the value of `a[i]` in `m`, `diff` is the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]**
