Example Answer:
`cnt` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input values after splitting them, `sm` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input values after splitting them, `sm` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is 0**
