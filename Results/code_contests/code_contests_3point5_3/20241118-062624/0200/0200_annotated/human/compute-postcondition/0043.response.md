Postcondition: ***`a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries with updated values, `cnt`, `diff`, `sm` are integers. The `ans` is updated by subtracting `diff` from `sm`, then subtracting `a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from the result. If `a[i]` is already present in dictionary `m`, then its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, a new key `a[i]` is added to `m` with a count of 1. In all cases, `sm` is increased by the value of `a[i]`.***
