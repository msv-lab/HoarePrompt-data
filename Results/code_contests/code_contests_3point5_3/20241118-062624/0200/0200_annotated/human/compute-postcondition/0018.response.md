Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input values after splitting them, `sm` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of the current value of `cnt` and the value at index `i` in list `a` which belongs to set `m` if `a[i]` is in `m`, `diff` is the product of the value at index `i` in list `a` and the value at index `a[i]` in list `m` if `a[i]` is in `m`, `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1` to its previous value, `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1` to its previous value.**
