Output State: **`a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries, `cnt`, `diff` are integers. If `a[i] - 1` is a key in `m`, `cnt` is increased by the corresponding value of `a[i] - 1` in `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i] - 1` and `m[a[i] - 1]` to its current value. If `a[i] - 1` is not a key in `m`, `a[i] - 1` is added as a new key in `m` with the value of 1.**
