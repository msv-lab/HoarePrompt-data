Example Answer: 
The value of `m[a[i]]` is added to `cnt`. The previous values of `cnt`, `m`, and `a` are not provided, so the output state is: `a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries with updated values, `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0, `sm` are integers, i is within the range of n - 1 to 1.
Output State: **`a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries with updated values, `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0, `sm` are integers, i is within the range of n - 1 to 1**
