Example Answer:
The value of `sm` is increased by `a[i]`. The previous values of `sm` and `a[i]` are unknown, so the final result cannot be calculated accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries, `cnt`, `diff` are integers. The `ans` is updated by subtracting `diff` from `sm`, then subtracting `a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from the result. `sm` is increased by `a[i]`.
Output State: **`a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries, `cnt`, `diff` are integers. The `ans` is updated by subtracting `diff` from `sm`, then subtracting `a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from the result. `sm` is increased by `a[i]`**
