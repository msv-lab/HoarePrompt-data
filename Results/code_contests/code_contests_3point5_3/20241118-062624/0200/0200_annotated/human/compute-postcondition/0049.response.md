Postcondition: ***`a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries with updated values. The `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i]]`. The `diff` is updated to include the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. `sm` are integers and `i` is still within the range of n - 1 to 1. The if statement handles the case where `a[i]` is present in `m` and updates the variables accordingly. All other cases are not covered explicitly in the provided program fragment.***
