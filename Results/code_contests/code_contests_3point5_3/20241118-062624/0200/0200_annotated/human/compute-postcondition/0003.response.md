Example Answer:
`m` is initialized as an empty dictionary, which does not affect the states of `n`, `a`, or `sm`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input values after splitting them; `sm` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input values after splitting them; `sm` is 0**
