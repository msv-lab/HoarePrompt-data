Postcondition: ***Output State: `a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries with updated values. `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]` if `a[i] - 1` is present in `m. `diff` is updated to include the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]` plus `(a[i]) * m[a[i]] + (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1)` if `a[i] - 1` is present in `m. `sm` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. `ans` is updated by subtracting `diff` and `a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from `sm`. `i` remains within the range of n - 1 to 1. In the if part, if `a[i]` is already in `m`, `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. In the else part, if `a[i]` is not in `m`, `m[a[i]]` is assigned the value 1.***
