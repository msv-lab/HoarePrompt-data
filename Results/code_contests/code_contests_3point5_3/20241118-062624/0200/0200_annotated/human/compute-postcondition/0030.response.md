Example Answer: 
If `a[i]` is a key in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by the corresponding value of `a[i]` in `m`. If `a[i]` is not a key in `m`, it is added as a new key with a value of 1 in `m`, and `cnt` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sm` is updated based on the values of `a[i]` and `m`, `cnt` is increased based on the value of `a[i]` in `m`, `diff` is 0.
Output State: **`sm` is updated based on the values of `a[i]` and `m`, `cnt` is increased based on the value of `a[i]` in `m`, `diff` is 0**
