Output State: **`a[i]`, `m` are dictionaries with updated values, `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is updated to include the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]` plus `(a[i]) * m[a[i]] + (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`, `sm` are integers, and `i` is still within the range of n - 1 to 1. If `a[i] + 1` is present in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`. All other cases are not explicitly handled in the provided code fragment.**
