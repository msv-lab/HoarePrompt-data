Example Answer:
The value of `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, where `a[i]` is found in the set `m`. The previous value of `m[a[i]]` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: All initial conditions remain satisfied. `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`. 
Output State: **All initial conditions remain satisfied. `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`**
