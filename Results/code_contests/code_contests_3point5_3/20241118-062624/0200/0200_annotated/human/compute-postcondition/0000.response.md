Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be between 1 and 200000. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000. List `a` remains unchanged**
