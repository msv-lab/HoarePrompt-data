Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) as described in the problem statement. The program uses a dictionary `m` to keep track of the count of each element in the array `a`. It then iterates over the array in reverse order and calculates the sum based on the specified conditions.

The logic inside the for loop correctly handles the cases where `a[i]`, `a[i] + 1`, and `a[i] - 1` are present in the dictionary `m`. The final answer `ans` is calculated accurately by updating the values of `cnt`, `diff`, and `sm` based on the conditions mentioned.

Since the program iterates over all possible pairs (i, j) and correctly computes the sum of d(ai, aj) for each pair, it satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
