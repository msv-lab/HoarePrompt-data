Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n. The program correctly iterates through the array elements, keeping track of the count, difference, and sum of elements encountered so far. It uses a dictionary to store the count of each element encountered. The logic implemented in the program accurately calculates the desired sum based on the given problem description. Additionally, the program handles all possible cases of pairs (i, j) in the array.
