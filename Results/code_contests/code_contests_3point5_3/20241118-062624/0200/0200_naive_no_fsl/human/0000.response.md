Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) as described in the problem statement. The logic in the code does not match the expected output for all potential cases.

For example, consider the input:
4
6 6 4 4

The expected output is -8, but the program will output 0. This shows that the program does not handle all cases correctly and therefore is incorrect.
