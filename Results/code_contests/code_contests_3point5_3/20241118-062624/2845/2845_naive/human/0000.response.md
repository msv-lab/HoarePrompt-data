Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment of the array. It simply calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array and then adds 1 and divides by 2, which does not represent the expected value as described in the problem.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
1 2
```
The expected output should be 1.5, but the program will output 2.5, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
