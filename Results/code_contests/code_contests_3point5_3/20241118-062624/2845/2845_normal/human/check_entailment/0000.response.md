Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` integers separated by spaces into an array `arr`.
- It calculates the number of unique elements in `arr` by converting it into a set and then taking its length.
- Finally, it prints half of that count incremented by 1, which gives the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment as per the problem description.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement: picking two integer numbers l and r from 1 to n inclusively, swapping them if l > r, and calculating the expected number of unique elements in the segment.

Therefore, the code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
