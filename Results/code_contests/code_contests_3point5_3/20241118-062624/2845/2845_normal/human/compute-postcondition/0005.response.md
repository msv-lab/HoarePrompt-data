Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, then reads `n` integers separated by spaces into an array `arr`. It calculates the number of unique elements in `arr` and prints half of that count incremented by 1. The function does not explicitly return any value.** 

The code does not handle any potential errors that may arise from the input process or the calculation.
