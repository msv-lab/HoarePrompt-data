Example Answer: 
The expression `req + 1` is evaluated first, then the result is divided by 2 and printed. Since `req` represents the number of unique elements in the array `a`, adding 1 to it and dividing by 2 results in the average of the number of unique elements and one additional element. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, req is the number of unique elements in the array a, and the average of req and one additional element is printed.**
