Example Answer:
The elements in the array `a` are converted to integers using the `map` function with `int` as the mapping function and `raw_input().split(' ')` as the iterable. The length of the array `a` is represented by the positive integer `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a. The elements in the array a are positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a. The elements in the array a are positive integers**
