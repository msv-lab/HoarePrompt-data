Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The length of the array `a` is represented by `n`, where all elements in the array `a` are positive integers. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a. The elements in the array a are positive integers.**
