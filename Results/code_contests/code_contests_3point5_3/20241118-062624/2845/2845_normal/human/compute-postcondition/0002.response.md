Example Answer:
The variable `req` is assigned the length of the set of elements in the array `arr`. Since the elements in the array `arr` are positive integers, the set of `arr` will contain unique elements only. Therefore, `req` will be the number of unique elements in the array `arr`. The length of a set represents the number of unique elements in it. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a. The elements in the array a are positive integers, req is the number of unique elements in the array a.**
