Example Answer: 
The variable `req` is assigned the length of the set of elements in the list `arr`. Since `arr` contains n positive integers, `req` will be the number of unique elements present in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers, req is the number of unique elements in the list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers, req is the number of unique elements in the list**
