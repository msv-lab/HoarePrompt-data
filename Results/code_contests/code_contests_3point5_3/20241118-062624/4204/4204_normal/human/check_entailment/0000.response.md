Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` recursively explores the city graph to find the maximum value associated with problem roads. However, the code does not correctly handle the case where multiple candidates are needed to repair all the problem roads. The code only considers one candidate and does not cover the scenario where more than one candidate is required to repair all problem roads. This violates the problem description, as the subset of candidates should be such that all problem roads in the city will be repaired. The output hints do not indicate that the code handles the case of multiple candidates, therefore the code is incorrect.
