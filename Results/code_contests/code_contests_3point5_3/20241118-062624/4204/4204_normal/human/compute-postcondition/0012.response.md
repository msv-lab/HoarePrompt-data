Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The depth is incremented by 1, the district in `grafo` at index `no[0]` has more elements to iterate, and the neighbor in `visitados` at index `vizinho[0]` is visited. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `no[0]` is a valid district, `grafo[no[0]]` has more elements to iterate, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is visited, and the depth is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `no[0]` is a valid district, `grafo[no[0]]` has more elements to iterate, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is visited, and the depth is increased by 1**
