Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of districts in the city. The input graph is represented as a list of n-1 bidirectional roads, where each road is described by three positive integers xi, yi, ti, representing the districts connected by the road and the road type (1 for non-problem road, 2 for problem road). The graph structure of the city is a tree. If there exists a problem road in the graph (ti = 2), the value in the 'cand' dictionary is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of the problem road. Otherwise, the 'cand' dictionary remains unchanged. 'visitados' is updated to mark the district 'no[0]' as visited.**
