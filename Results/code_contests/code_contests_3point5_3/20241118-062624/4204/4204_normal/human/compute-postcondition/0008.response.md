According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `grafo[no[0]]` and whether `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is visited. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `no[0]` is a valid district, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not visited, then `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `no[0]` is a valid district, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is visited, if `func_1` is called set `visitados[vizinho[0]]` as visited.**
