Example Answer: 
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The depth is incremented by 1. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `no[0]` is a valid district, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, and `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not visited.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `no[0]` is a valid district, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, and `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not visited**
