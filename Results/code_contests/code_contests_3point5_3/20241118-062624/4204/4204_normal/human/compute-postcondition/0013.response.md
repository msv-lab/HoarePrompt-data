Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `no[0]` is a valid district, `grafo[no[0]]` has more elements to iterate, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is visited, and the depth is increased by 1 if `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not already visited. There are no additional changes to the variables in other cases.***
