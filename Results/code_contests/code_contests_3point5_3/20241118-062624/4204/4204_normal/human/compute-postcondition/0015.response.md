Output State: 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of districts in the city.
- `no[0]` is a valid district.
- `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty.
- If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not visited, then `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`.
- If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is visited, no changes occur.
- The loop will continue to iterate through the neighbors of the current district until all neighbors have been visited or there are no more neighbors to visit.
- In the case where there are no neighbors left to visit, the loop will not execute further, and no additional changes will occur.
