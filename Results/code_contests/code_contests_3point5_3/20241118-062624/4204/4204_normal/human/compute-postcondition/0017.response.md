Functionality: **The function `func_1` recursively explores a city represented as a graph to find the maximum value associated with problem roads. It traverses the graph starting from a given district, updating the candidate value if a problem road is encountered. The function does not have a specified return value. However, it may have missing functionality related to error handling or additional constraints not covered in the annotations.**
