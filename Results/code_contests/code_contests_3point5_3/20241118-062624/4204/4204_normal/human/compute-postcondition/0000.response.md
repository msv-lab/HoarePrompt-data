Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer representing the number of districts in the city. The input graph is represented as a list of n-1 bidirectional roads, where each road is described by three positive integers xi, yi, ti, representing the districts connected by the road and the road type (1 for non-problem road, 2 for problem road). The graph structure of the city is a tree. The program enters the if condition based on the existence of a problem road in the graph.***
