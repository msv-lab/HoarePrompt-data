Example Answer:
The value of cand['value'] is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and no[0]. The condition no[1] is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of districts in the city; xi and yi are positive integers representing the districts connected by the i-th bidirectional road; ti is a positive integer representing the road type, where ti can be either 1 or 2; the graph structure of the city is a tree; the condition no[1] is true; cand['value'] is updated to the maximum value between its current value and no[0].
