Postcondition: ***visitados[no[0]] is set to True, grafo[no[0]] has at least 1 element, vizinho is the first element in grafo[no[0]. If visitados[vizinho[0]] is not True, then func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand) is executed. The overall state of the program after the if statement is that visitados[no[0]] is True, grafo[no[0]] has at least 1 element, and the condition for vizinho being the first element in grafo[no[0]] is maintained.***
