According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `grafo[no[0]]`. If the list at grafo[no[0]] has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, visitados[no[0]] is set to True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to grafo[no[0]] has at least 1 element and vizinho is the first element in the list grafo[no[0].
State: **visitados[no[0]] is set to True, grafo[no[0]] has at least 1 element, vizinho is the first element in grafo[no[0]]**
