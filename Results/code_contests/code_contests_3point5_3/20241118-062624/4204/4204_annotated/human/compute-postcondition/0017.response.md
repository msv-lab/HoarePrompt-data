Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `no`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth`, and `cand`. It updates the value in `cand` to the maximum between its current value and `no[0]`. Then, it marks the district `no[0]` as visited. For each neighbor in the graph connected to `no[0]`, if the neighbor has not been visited, the function recursively calls itself with the neighbor as the new node to explore. The function does not have a specified return value.**
