According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `grafo[no[0]]` for `vizinho` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 1 element, and `vizinho` is the first element in `grafo[no[0]]`. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `grafo[no[0]]` should be assigned to `vizinho`.
State: **visitados[no[0]] is True, grafo[no[0]] has at least 2 elements, vizinho is the second element in grafo[no[0]]**
