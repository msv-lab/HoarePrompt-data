Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program takes an input N and a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s. It then determines whether there exists a closed curve that satisfies the given condition. The program follows the problem description accurately by checking for the existence of a closed curve that meets the specified conditions. It handles the construction of the closed curve and outputs the result as required. The program covers all potential cases and outputs either "Possible" with the closed curve or "Impossible" based on the conditions provided. Overall, the program seems to be correct and adheres to the problem requirements.
