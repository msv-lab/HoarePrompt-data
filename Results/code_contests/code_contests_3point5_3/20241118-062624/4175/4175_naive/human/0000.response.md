Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program implements the logic described in the problem statement to determine whether there exists a closed curve that satisfies the given condition. The program follows the constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as checking for the possibility of a closed curve and printing the curve in the specified format. The program iterates through the input sequence and constructs the closed curve accordingly. Additionally, the program handles both the "Possible" and "Impossible" cases as required. Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and its alignment with the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true for all potential cases.
