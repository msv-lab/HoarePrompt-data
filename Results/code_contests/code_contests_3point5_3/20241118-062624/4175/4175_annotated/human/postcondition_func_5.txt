The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `s1` and `s2`. The function converts `s1` to a non-negative integer `n` and iterates through a range based on `n`, extracting subsets `s` based on conditions from `s2`. Depending on specific conditions within the loop, the boolean variable `ok` may be set to False. After processing, it generates a list `ret_gp` containing return values from `func_2` for each valid iteration. It then constructs `ret_path` by combining tuples from the return values of `func_4` applied to each element of `ret_gp`. If `ok` is true, it prints 'Possible', followed by the length of `ret_path` minus 1, and then prints the x and y values of each tuple in `ret_path`. If `ok` is false, it prints 'Impossible'. The function does not have a specified return value.
