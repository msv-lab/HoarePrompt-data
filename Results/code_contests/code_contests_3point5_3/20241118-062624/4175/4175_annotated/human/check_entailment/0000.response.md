Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It defines multiple functions to handle different aspects of the problem, such as generating closed curves and checking conditions based on the input sequences.

The program follows the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description, including the input format, output format, and conditions for determining the existence of a closed curve. The functions are structured to handle different cases and generate the output accordingly.

Additionally, the program includes annotations that explain the purpose of each function and the logic behind the code, making it easier to understand and verify.

Overall, based on the implementation and the description provided, there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
