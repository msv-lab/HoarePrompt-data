The function func_3 accepts an integer parameter v. If v is greater than 0, the function returns a list of tuples following a specific pattern. The list starts from (1, 0) to (v - 1, 0), includes (v, 1) and (v - 1, 1) in between. If v is less than 0, the function returns the reversed result of func_3 with input -v. In cases where v is less than or equal to 0, the program either returns the reversed result of func_3 with -v or None.
