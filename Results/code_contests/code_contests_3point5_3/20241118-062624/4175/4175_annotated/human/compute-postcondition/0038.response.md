According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `ok` being a boolean variable does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `ind` is 0.
State: **`ok` is a boolean variable, `s` contains elements based on the condition with unknown values, `n` is greater than 0, `ind` is 0**
