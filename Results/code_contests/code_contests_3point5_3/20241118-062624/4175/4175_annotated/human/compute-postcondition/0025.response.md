Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean variable where its value is False if, after the execution, the conditions hold: `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 1, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3], `ind` is 0, and the result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2, and the element of `s2` at index `i + 2 ** ind` is equal to '1'. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the execution of the if else block.***
