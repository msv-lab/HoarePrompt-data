According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3], `ind` is 2, and the result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2. The element of `s2` at index `i + 2`. To execute one more time, `ind` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the if statement executes, the program's state is such that `ok` is False. `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 2. `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`. `i` is -2. `s` is [1, 2, 3]. `ind` is 3. The result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2. The element of `s2` at index `i + 2**
