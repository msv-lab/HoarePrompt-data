Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean variable, initially True. `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1`. `ret_gp` is a list containing the return values of `func_2(s)` if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') is not met for any index in the loop. `i` is 2^n - 1. `s` is a list generated from the elements v + 1 for v in range(n) that satisfy the condition ((i >> v) % 2 == 1).***
