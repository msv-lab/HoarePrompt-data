Output State: **`ok` is a boolean variable that indicates whether the condition was satisfied based on the loop's logic. If the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') is met during any iteration, `ok` will be set to False. If the loop does not execute for any reason, `ok` will remain True.**
