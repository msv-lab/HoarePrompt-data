According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `2 ** n - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2) was evaluated and `ok` was set to False if the condition was met for each iteration of the loop. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to one less than its current value.
State: **`ok` is a boolean variable. After the if statement executes, `ok` is False if, for each iteration of the loop with index `ind` ranging from 0 to n-1, the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2, i is 2 ** n - 1 - 1**
