According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `ind`, and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean variable indicating if the condition was satisfied, ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2). So for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` should be adjusted to be less than `n` + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ok` is a boolean variable indicating if the condition was satisfied, ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2), `ind` is less than `n` + 1**
