Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean variable that may be changed to False based on specific conditions within the loop. `n` is a non-negative integer derived from the input string `s1`. `ret_gp` is a list containing the return values of `func_2(s)` for each valid iteration of the loop. `ret_path` is a list containing tuples generated from `ret_gp` using `func_4`, with an initial tuple (0, 0) included. If `ok` is true, the program prints 'Possible', followed by the length of `ret_path` minus 1. It then iterates over each tuple in `ret_path`, printing the values of `x` and `y` as strings. If `ret_path` is empty, no values are printed. If `ok` is false, the program prints 'Impossible'.***
