Output State: **`ok` is a boolean variable. The loop conditions are checked based on the values of `i` and `ind`. The loop will run at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If the condition is met, `ok` is set to False. If the condition is not met for any iteration, `ok` remains True. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute. `ret_gp` is updated by adding the result of `func_2(s)`.**
