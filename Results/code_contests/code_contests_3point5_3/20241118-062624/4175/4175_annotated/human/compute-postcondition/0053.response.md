Output State: **`ok` is a boolean variable that may be changed to False based on specific conditions within the loop. `n` is a non-negative integer derived from the input string `s1`. `ret_gp` is a list containing the return values of `func_2(s)` for each valid iteration of the loop. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If `s2[i]` is equal to '0', additional conditions are checked for each iteration of the loop with index `ind` ranging from 0 to n-1. If these conditions are met, `ok` is set to False.**
