Example Answer:
The program prints the values of `x` and `y` as strings concatenated with a space in between. The values of `x` and `y` are extracted from the next tuple in `ret_path`. Since `ret_path` is a non-empty list of tuples with at least one more tuple to iterate over, `x` and `y` have valid values from the next tuple in `ret_path`. Therefore, the Output State is: The program prints the length of `ret_path`, `ret_path` is a non-empty list of tuples with at least one more tuple to iterate over, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed as strings.
Output State: **The program prints the length of `ret_path`, `ret_path` is a non-empty list of tuples with at least one more tuple to iterate over, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed as strings**
