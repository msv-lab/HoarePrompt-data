Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, the program's state is such that `ok` is False. `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 2. `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`. `i` is -2. `s` is [1, 2, 3]. `ind` is 2. The result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2. The element of `s2` at index `i + 2 ** ind` satisfies the condition.***
