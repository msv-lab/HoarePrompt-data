Output State: **After the loop executes, `ok` is False if the conditions inside the loop are met. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than 0. `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`. `i` remains -2 throughout the loop. `s` is [1, 2, 3]. `ind` will iterate from 0 to n-1. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or negative.**
