According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `n` variable. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 1, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3], `ind` is 0, and the result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2, and the element of `s2` at index `i + 2. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`ok` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3], `ind` is 1, and the result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2, and the element of `s2` at index `i + 2
