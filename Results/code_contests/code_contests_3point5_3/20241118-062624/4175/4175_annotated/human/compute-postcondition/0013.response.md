According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean variable. If ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2, `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ind`. To execute the loop one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `ind` and `ok` should still satisfy the condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ok` is a boolean variable. If ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2, `n` is greater than the current value of `ind`**
