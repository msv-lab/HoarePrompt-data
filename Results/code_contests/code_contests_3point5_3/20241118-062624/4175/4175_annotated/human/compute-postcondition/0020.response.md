According to the code, the loop will execute `2 ** n` times until `i` reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1`, and `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be one less than the current value, which is -1.
State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1`, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2**
