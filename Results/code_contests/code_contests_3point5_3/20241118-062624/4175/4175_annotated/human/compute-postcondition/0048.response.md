According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean variable, `i` and `ind` are specific values, `n` is greater than `ind`. If `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` should be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ok` is a boolean variable, `i` and `ind` are specific values, `n` is greater than `ind + 1**.
