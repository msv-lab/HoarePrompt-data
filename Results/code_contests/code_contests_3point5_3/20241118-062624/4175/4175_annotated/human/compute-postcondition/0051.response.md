Postcondition: ***ok is a boolean variable. If s2[i] is equal to '0', the loop iterates over the range of n, checking conditions related to i and ind. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is met for any iteration, ok is set to False. If the condition is not met for any iteration, ok remains True. If n is 0 or less, the loop does not execute. After the loop execution, ret_gp is updated by adding the result of func_2(s).***
