Example Answer:
The list comprehension creates a list `s` by iterating over a range of `n` values and adding 1 to each value if the corresponding bit in `i` is 1. Since `i` is -2 in this case, the binary representation of -2 is 111..1110 in two's complement form. Therefore, all bits are 1 except the rightmost bit. 
Hence, for the given `n`, the values will be [0, 1, 2] as the first three bits are 1. 
The output state is: `ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1`, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3].
Output State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1`, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3]**
