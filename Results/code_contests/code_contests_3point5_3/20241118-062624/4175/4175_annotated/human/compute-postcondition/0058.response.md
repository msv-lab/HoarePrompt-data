According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path`. If `ret_path` has at least 1 tuple, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the program prints the length of `ret_path` minus 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `ret_path` is a non-empty list of tuples and `x` and `y` are the first tuple in `ret_path`.
State: **The program prints the length of `ret_path` minus 1, `ret_path` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x` and `y` are the first tuple in `ret_path**.
