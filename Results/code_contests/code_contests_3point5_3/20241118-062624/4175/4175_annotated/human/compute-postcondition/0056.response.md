Output State: **`ok` is a boolean variable that may be changed to False based on specific conditions within the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from the input string `s1`, `ret_gp` is a list containing the return values of `func_2(s)` for each valid iteration of the loop, `ret_path` is a list containing tuples generated from `ret_gp` using `func_4`, with an initial tuple (0, 0) included. The program enters the if condition when `ok` is True. The output prints 'Possible'.**
