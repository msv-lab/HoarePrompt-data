Output State: The loop iterates over each tuple in `ret_path`, printing the values of `x` and `y` as strings. After the loop executes, the program prints the length of `ret_path` minus 1, `ret_path` is a non-empty list of tuples. If `ret_path` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and no values are printed.
