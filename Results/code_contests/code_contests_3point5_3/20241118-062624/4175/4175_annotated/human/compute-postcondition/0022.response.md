Based on the code provided, the loop execution depends on the variables `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 1, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3], `ind` is 0**
