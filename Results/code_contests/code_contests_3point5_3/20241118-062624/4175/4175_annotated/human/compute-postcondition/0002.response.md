Example Answer: 
The list `ret_gp` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `ok` is True, `n` is an integer based on the input string `s1`, `ret_gp` is an empty list.
Output State: **`ok` is True, `n` is an integer based on the input string `s1`, `ret_gp` is an empty list**
