Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean variable, `i` and `ind` are specific values, `n` is greater than `ind`. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is satisfied, then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables. Ensure that `ok` remains False when the condition is met, and no changes occur when the condition is not met.***
