Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean variable. After the if statement executes, `ok` is False if, for each iteration of the loop with index `ind` ranging from 0 to n-1, the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') is satisfied. The loop iterates at least once if n is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and greater than 0. `ret_gp` is updated by adding the return values of `func_2(s)`. `i` remains -2 throughout the loop. The sequence `s` remains [1, 2, 3]. The loop does not execute if `n` is 0 or negative. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge cases of the if statement***
