According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3], `ind` is 1, and the result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2, and the element of `s2` at index `i + 2` meets the specified condition. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted: `ind` needs to be incremented by 1 to meet the condition for the loop to continue.
State: **At the end of the if block, the state of the program is such that `ok` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3], `ind` is 2, and the result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2, and the element of `s2` at index `i + 2` meets the specified condition.**
