Example Answer:
The boolean variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `i` and `ind` are specific and `n` is greater than `ind`, but they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ok` is False, `i` is specific, `ind` is specific, and `n` is greater than `ind`.
Output State: **`ok` is False, `i` is specific, `ind` is specific, and `n` is greater than `ind`**
