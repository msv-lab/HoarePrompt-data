According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean variable, `i` and `ind` are specific values, `n` is greater than `ind`. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2``` is true, then the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`ok` is a boolean variable, `i` and `ind` are specific values, `n` is greater than `ind`**
