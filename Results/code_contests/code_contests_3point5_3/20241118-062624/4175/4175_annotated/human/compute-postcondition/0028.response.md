Postcondition: ***At the end of the if block, the state of the program is such that `ok` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer derived from `s1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `ret_gp` contains the return values of `func_2(s)`, `i` is -2, `s` is [1, 2, 3], `ind` is 1, and the result of shifting `i` right by `ind` results in a multiple of 2, and the element of `s2` at index `i + 2` meets the specified condition. This state ensures that the loop can execute another iteration based on the values and conditions set by the program fragment.***
