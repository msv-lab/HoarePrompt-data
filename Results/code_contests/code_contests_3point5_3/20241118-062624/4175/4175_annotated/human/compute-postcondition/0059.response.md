Example Answer:
The code prints the string concatenation of the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first tuple in `ret_path`. The length of `ret_path` minus 1 is printed. Since the length of `ret_path` is non-empty, the length minus 1 is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: The program prints the length of `ret_path` minus 1, `ret_path` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x` and `y` are the first tuple in `ret_path`.
Output State: **The program prints the length of `ret_path` minus 1, `ret_path` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x` and `y` are the first tuple in `ret_path**
