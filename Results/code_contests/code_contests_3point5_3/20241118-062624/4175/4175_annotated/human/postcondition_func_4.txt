The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_6` with the arguments '1' and '11'. The actual purpose or outcome of this function is unclear as the annotations do not provide sufficient information. It seems to rely on the behavior of `func_6` to determine its overall functionality.
