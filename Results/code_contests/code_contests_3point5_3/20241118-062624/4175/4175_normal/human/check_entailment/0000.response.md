Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` lacks proper handling for cases where the input list `s` is empty or when the conditions specified in the annotations are not met. This can lead to incorrect results and violates the problem description requirements. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
