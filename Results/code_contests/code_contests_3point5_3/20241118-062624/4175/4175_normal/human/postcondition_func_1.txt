The function `func_2` takes a list `s` as input and recursively processes the elements. If the length of the list is 0, it returns a list containing the value of the last element `v`. Otherwise, it returns a list containing the value of `v`, `v` itself, the negated value of `v`, and the negated value of `v` again. The function lacks proper handling for cases where the input list `s` is empty or when the conditions specified in the annotations are not met.
