According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True or False, `n` is greater than 1, `ret_gp` is a list containing the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is greater than or equal to -1, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N where each value is incremented by 1 if the corresponding bit in `i` is 1**
