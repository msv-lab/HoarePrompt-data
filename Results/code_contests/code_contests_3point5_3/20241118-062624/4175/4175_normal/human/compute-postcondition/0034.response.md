Output State: After the loop executes, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2, `ret_gp` is incremented by the value returned from `func_2(s)`.
