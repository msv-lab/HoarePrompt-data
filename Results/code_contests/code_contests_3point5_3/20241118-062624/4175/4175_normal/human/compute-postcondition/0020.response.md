According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True, `n` is an integer value obtained from converting `s1` to an integer where N is at least 1, `ret_gp` is a list containing the result of `func_2(s)` based on the input string `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to -1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True, `n` is an integer value obtained from converting `s1` to an integer where N is at least 1, `ret_gp` is a list containing the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is greater than or equal to -1**
