Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `s1` remains a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` still represents a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `n` is an integer value obtained from converting `s1` to an integer where N is at least 1. If `ok` is True, 'Possible' is printed, followed by the length of `ret_path` - 1, and then each tuple of `ret_path` is printed as strings of x and y separated by a space. If `ok` is False, 'Impossible' is printed. In all cases, `ret_path` will contain the tuple (0, 0) followed by the flattened list comprehension of `ret_gp` where each element is passed through `func_4` and unpacked as tuples into the list.***
