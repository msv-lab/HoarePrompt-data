Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True, `n` is an integer value obtained from converting `s1` to an integer where N is at least 1, `ret_gp` is a list containing the result of `func_2(s)` based on the input string `s`. After the execution of the program fragment, `ok` is set to False if specific conditions are met in the loop, and `ret_gp` is updated with the result of `func_2(s)`. All possible edge cases where `ok` could be set to False are handled, and `ret_gp` is appended with the appropriate value based on the input string `s`.***
