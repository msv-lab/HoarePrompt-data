Output State: **After the loop executes, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') is met at least once during the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ret_gp` is a list containing the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is greater than or equal to -1, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N where each value is incremented by 1 if the corresponding bit in `i` is 1. If the condition is never satisfied, `ok` remains True.**
