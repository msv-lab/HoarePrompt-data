Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `s1` remains a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` still represents a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` becomes False if for every `ind` in the range of `n`, the conditions ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') are met. In this case, `ret_gp` is updated by adding the return value of `func_2(s)`. If the conditions are not met, the state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `i`, and `s`.***
