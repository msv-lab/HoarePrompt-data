Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, if ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2^ind] == '1'), the variable `ok` is set to False. The program state remains the same: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N+1 where N is at least 1, `s2` represents a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is within the range (2, `s` is a list comprehension where each element is v + 1 for v in range(N+1) if (i >> v) % 2 == 1, `ind` is 0.***
