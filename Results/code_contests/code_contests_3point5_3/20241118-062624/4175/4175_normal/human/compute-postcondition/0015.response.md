Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^(N+1) consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is satisfied, then `ok` is set to False. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if block, and there is no else part to consider.***
