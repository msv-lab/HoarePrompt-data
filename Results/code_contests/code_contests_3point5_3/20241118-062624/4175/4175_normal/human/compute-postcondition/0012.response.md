Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False if (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' for the given conditions, `n` is an integer value obtained from converting `s1` to an integer where N is at least 1, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `ind` is incremented by 1 if `ind` is less than `n`.***
