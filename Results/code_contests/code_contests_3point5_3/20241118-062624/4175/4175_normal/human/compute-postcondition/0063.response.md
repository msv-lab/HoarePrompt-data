Example Answer:
The code prints the values of `x` and `y` as strings concatenated with a space. The values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will be the printed values of `x` and `y`.
Output State: **The values of `x` and `y` are printed as strings with a space between them.**
