According to the code, the loop can execute again if there is at least one more pair (x, y) in the list ret_path. At the end of the last iteration, the values of x and y were printed as strings with a space between them. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to have at least one more pair (x, y) in the list ret_path.
State: **The values of `x` and `y` are printed as strings with a space between them, there is at least one more pair (x, y) in the list ret_path**
