According to the code, the loop can execute again if `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^(N+1) consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^(N+1) consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `n` is incremented by 1**
