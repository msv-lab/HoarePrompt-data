According to the code, the loop can execute if the `n` value is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `s1` representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, since `i` is greater than or equal to -1, it does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `ret_gp` is a list containing the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is greater than or equal to -1, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N where each value is incremented by 1 if the corresponding bit in `i` is 1**
