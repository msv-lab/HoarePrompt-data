Since we are not given the specific values of the state variables at the end of the previous iteration, we need to analyze the loop structure to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the elements of the `ret_path` list, unpacking each tuple into variables `x` and `y`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in the `ret_path` list.

Based on the loop structure, we can determine the following adjustments that need to be made:
1. There must be at least one more tuple in the `ret_path` list for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **Adjustments specific to the end of the previous iteration are unknown as the initial state is not provided.**
