Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `s1` remains a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` still represents a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` becomes False if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') holds true for any index `ind` in the range of `n`. Additionally, `ret_gp` is updated by adding the result of `func_2(s)`. The state remains consistent with the precondition, ensuring the integrity of the variables and their relationships after the execution of the program fragment.***
