According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is not less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than -1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: *After the execution of the if-else block, `s1` remains a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` still represents a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` becomes False if for every `ind` in the range of `n`, the conditions ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2
