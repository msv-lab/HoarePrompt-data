Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` represents a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is within the range (2, `s` is a list comprehension where each element is v + 1 for v in range(n) if (i >> v) % 2 == 1, `ind` is 0. If ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2**ind] == '1'), then `ok` is set to False.***
