According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is False, `n` is greater than 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ind` needs to be less than `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `n` is greater than 2, `ret_gp` is a list containing the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is greater than or equal to -1, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N where each value is incremented by 1 if the corresponding bit in `i` is 1. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2, `ind` is less than `n+1**
