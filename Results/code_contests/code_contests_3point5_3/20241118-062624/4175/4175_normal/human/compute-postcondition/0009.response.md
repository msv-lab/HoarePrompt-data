Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is either True or False depending on the condition, `n` is an integer value obtained from converting `s1` to an integer where N is at least 1, `ret_gp` is an empty list. If the i-th bit and (i + 2^ind)-th bit in s2 are 0 and 1 respectively, then `ok` is set to False.***
