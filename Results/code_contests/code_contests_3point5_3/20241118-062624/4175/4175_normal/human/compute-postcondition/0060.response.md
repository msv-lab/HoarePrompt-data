According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ret_path` list. If there are more tuples in the `ret_path` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the code printed out the values of `x` and `y`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `ret_path` list must have at least one more tuple. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The code prints out the values of `x` and `y`**
