Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N and `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s. The function iterates through a loop based on the range of `i` to manipulate `s` and make comparisons with elements of `s2`. Depending on certain conditions, the variable `ok` is updated. The function then constructs `ret_gp` by calling `func_2(s)` for each iteration. After processing `ret_gp`, the function constructs `ret_path` by calling `func_4` on elements of `ret_gp`. If `ok` is True, the function prints a certain format of output, otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'. The function does not explicitly return any value. It is essential to handle edge cases where `s1` is not a valid positive integer or the length of `s2` is not equal to 2^N to prevent errors.**
