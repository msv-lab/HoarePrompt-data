The function func_3 accepts a parameter `v` and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer and either 0 or 1. If `v` is positive, the function generates a specific sequence of integers with alternating 0s and 1s based on the value of `v`. If `v` is negative, the function returns the reverse of the binary sequence obtained by calling func_3 with the negation of `v` as input. In the case where `v` is non-negative, there is no change in the state of the variables.
