Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the `func_1` function where the dictionary `res_map` is not being initialized correctly. This leads to incorrect handling of cases where the number of candies in a box is equal to 0. The code does not account for this scenario and fails to produce the correct output in such cases. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
