Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer, `candy` is the first element in candy_array. If `res_map` has a key of `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `res_map` does not have the key `k - candy % k`, then a new key `candy % k` is added to `res_map` with a value of 1. If there is no key `candy % k` in `res_map`, its value is incremented by 1. This postcondition covers all scenarios after the execution of the if else block, ensuring the correct state of the variables.***
