Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with the necessary key-value pairs. If `res_map` has the key (k - candy % k) and the corresponding value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value of (k - candy % k) in `res_map` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the key (k - candy % k) is not present or the value is 0, the value of candy % k is updated in `res_map` by incrementing it if the key is already present or adding a new key-value pair with the value 1. This logic covers all possible scenarios where the dictionary `res_map` is manipulated based on the conditions stated in the program fragment.***
