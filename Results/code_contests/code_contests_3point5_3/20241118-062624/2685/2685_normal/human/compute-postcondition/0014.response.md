According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the candy_array and the conditions specified for updating the res_map and res variables. At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer, and `candy` is the next element in candy_array. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the key `(k - candy % k)` in `res_map` should exist and have a value greater than 0, leading to an increase in `res` by 2 and a decrement of the corresponding value in `res_map`. If this condition is not met, the key `(candy % k)` should exist in `res_map` and its value should be incremented by 1, or it should be set to 1 if it doesn't exist.

State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with the necessary keys and values as per the conditions mentioned, `res` is an updated integer value, and `candy` is the next element in candy_array**.
