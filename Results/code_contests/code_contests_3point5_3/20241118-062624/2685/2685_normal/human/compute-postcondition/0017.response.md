Example Answer:
The value of `candy % k` is used as a key to update the `res_map` dictionary. If the key already exists, the value corresponding to that key is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new key-value pair is added with the value 1. The `res` variable is not affected, and `candy` becomes the next element in `candy_array`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs based on the condition, `res` is an updated integer value, and `candy` is the next element in `candy_array`.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs based on the condition, `res` is an updated integer value, and `candy` is the next element in `candy_array`**
