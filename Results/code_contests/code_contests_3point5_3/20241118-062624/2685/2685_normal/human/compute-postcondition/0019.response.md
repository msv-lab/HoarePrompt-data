According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If there are more candies in the array, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `res_map` is a dictionary with the necessary key-value pairs. The manipulation of `res_map` depends on the conditions specified in the program fragment. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to follow these steps:
1. Check if there are more candies in the `candy_array`.
2. Update the `res_map` based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.

Since we do not have specific details about the `res_map`, `candy_array`, or the specific conditions in the loop body, we can't provide exact adjustments to the states. It would depend on the specific values and conditions in the `res_map` and `candy_array`.

State: **The adjustments to the states would depend on the specific values and conditions in the `res_map` and `candy_array`.**
