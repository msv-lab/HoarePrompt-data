Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer, and `candy` is the next element in candy_array. If res_map has the key (k - candy % k) and the corresponding value is greater than 0, then res is increased by 2 and the value in res_map at (k - candy % k) is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, the value in res_map at (candy % k) is incremented by 1 if it exists, otherwise it is set to 1. This postcondition covers all cases including the increment and decrement of values in res_map based on the modulo operation and the final values of res and candy.***
