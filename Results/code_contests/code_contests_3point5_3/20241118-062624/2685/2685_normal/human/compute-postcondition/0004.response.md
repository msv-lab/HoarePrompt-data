Example Answer:
The value of `res` is increased by 2. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 2. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, `res` is 2, `candy` is the first element in candy_array.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, `res` is 2, `candy` is the first element in candy_array**
