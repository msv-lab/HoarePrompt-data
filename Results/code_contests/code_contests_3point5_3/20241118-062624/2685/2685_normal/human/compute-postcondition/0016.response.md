Example Answer:
The value of `k - candy % k` is calculated and used as the key to access the value in `res_map`. The value at that key is then decremented by 1. The previous values of `res_map`, `res`, and `candy` are not provided, so the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with the necessary keys and values as per the conditions mentioned, `res` is an updated integer value, and `candy` is the next element in candy_array**
