Example Answer:
The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. The initial values of `res_map`, `res`, and `candy` are not provided, so their exact values are unknown. The output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary with key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, `res` is 2, `candy` is the first element in candy_array.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, `res` is 2, `candy` is the first element in candy_array**
