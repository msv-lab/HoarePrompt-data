Example Answer:
The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. The previous values of `res_map`, `res`, and `candy` are unknown, so the output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer with a new value, `candy` is the next element in candy_array.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer with a new value, `candy` is the next element in candy_array**
