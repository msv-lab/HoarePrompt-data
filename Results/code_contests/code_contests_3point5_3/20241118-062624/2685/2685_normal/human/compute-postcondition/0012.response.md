Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value in `res_map` based on the modulo operation of `candy` with `k`. If the key already exists in `res_map`, the value is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new key-value pair is added with the value 1. The values of `res_map`, `res`, and `candy` are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`res_map` is updated based on the modulo operation, `res` remains an integer, `candy` is the next element in candy_array**
