According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the candy_array. If there are more candies in the array, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer, `candy` is the first element in candy_array. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the candy_array should have more elements, and the loop should be able to process the next candy. In this case, the `candy` variable should be updated to the next candy in candy_array.
State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer, `candy` is the next element in candy_array**
