Example Answer:
The value of `res` is increased by 2. The previous value of `res` is unknown. The other variables `res_map` and `candy` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with the necessary keys and values as per the conditions mentioned, `res` is an updated integer value, and `candy` is the next element in candy_array.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with the necessary keys and values as per the conditions mentioned, `res` is an updated integer value, and `candy` is the next element in candy_array**
