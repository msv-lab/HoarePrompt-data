Example Answer: 
The value of `res` is incremented by 2, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `res` will be 2 more than the previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer with a new value, `candy` is the next element in candy_array**
