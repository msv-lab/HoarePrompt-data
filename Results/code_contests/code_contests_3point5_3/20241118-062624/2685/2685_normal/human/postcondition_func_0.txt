The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` - a positive integer representing the number of girls, and `candy_array` - a list of positive integers representing the number of candies in each box. The function iterates through the candy_array, updating a dictionary `res_map` based on certain conditions. The final result `res` is printed after the loop completes. However, there seems to be a logic issue in the code where the dictionary `res_map` is being manipulated incorrectly. The code does not return any specific output as indicated, and there is a potential issue with handling the cases where `candy_array` is empty.
