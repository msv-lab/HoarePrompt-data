Postcondition: ***`res_map` and `candy` are adjusted based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 2 and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, `res_map[candy % k]` is increased by 1 if `res_map` has the key `candy % k`, otherwise it is set to 1. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring the proper adjustment of `res_map` and `candy` based on the specified conditions for the next iteration of the loop.***
