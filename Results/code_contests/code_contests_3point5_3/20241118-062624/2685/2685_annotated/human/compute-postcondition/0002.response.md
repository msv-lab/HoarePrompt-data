According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the candy_array. If the array has at least 1 candy, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, res_map is an empty dictionary and res is 0. To ensure that the loop executes, the candy_array must have at least 1 candy, res_map remains as an empty dictionary, res remains as 0.
State: **`res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy**
