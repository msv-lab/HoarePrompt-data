Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with updated values based on the logic in the code. If `res_map` has the key (k - candy % k) and the corresponding value is greater than 0, then `res` is incremented by 2 and the value at key (k - candy % k) in `res_map` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, the value at key (candy % k) in `res_map` is increased by 1 if the key exists, otherwise it is set to 1. In all cases, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies and the overall state of the program variables are appropriately updated after the execution of the if else block.***
