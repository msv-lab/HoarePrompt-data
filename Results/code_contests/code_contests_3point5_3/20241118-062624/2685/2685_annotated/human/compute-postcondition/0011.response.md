Example Answer:
The value of `res_map` is updated by subtracting 1 from the value at the key `k - candy % k`. The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The `candy_array` is not directly affected. 
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated values, `res` is an integer incremented by 2, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies**
