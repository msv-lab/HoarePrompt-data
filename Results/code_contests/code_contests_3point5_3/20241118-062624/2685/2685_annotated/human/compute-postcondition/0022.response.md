The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` and `candy_array`. The precondition states that `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `candy_array` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function does not have specified return values or conditions, so it may perform various operations on the `candy_array` based on the value of `k`.
