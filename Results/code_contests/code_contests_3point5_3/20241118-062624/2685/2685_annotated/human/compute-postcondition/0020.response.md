Output State: **After the loop executes, `res_map` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs based on the conditions specified in the loop. `res` is an integer representing the final result after the loop iterations. `candy_array` is a list with at least 1 candy. If the condition `res_map.has_key(k - candy % k) and res_map[k - candy % k] > 0` is met, `res` is increased by 2 and the corresponding value in `res_map` is decremented by 1. If the condition is not met, a new key-value pair is added to `res_map` where the key is `candy % k` and the value is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 if the key does not exist. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block. If the candy_array is empty, the loop will not execute and `res_map` will remain an empty dictionary and `res` will stay at 0.**
