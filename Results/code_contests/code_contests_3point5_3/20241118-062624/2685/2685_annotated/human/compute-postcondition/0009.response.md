According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If there are more candies in the array, the loop will execute again. 
At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy.
To execute the loop one more time, the candy_array should have at least 2 candies.
No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies**
