Example Answer:
The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. The initial state mentions that the key (k - candy % k) exists in `res_map` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, so after the operation, the value of the corresponding key in `res_map` is reduced by 1. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is increased by 2, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy, the corresponding key in `res_map` has been decremented by 1**
