According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the conditions specified for adjusting `res_map` and `candy`. At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` and `candy` are adjusted based on the conditions specified. For the loop to execute one more time, the adjustment of `res_map` and `candy` should follow the postconditions specified in the task description. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is greater than 0, `res` should be increased by 2 and `res_map[k - candy % k]` should be reduced by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, `res_map[candy % k]` should be increased by 1 if `res_map` has the key `candy % k`, otherwise it should be set to 1.

State: **Adjust `res_map` and `candy` based on the specified conditions for the next iteration of the loop to ensure proper execution**
