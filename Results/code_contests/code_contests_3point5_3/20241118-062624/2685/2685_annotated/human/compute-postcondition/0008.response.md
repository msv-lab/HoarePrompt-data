Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy. If `res_map` has a key (k - candy % k) and the corresponding value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value at key (k - candy % k) in `res_map` is decreased by 1. If the if condition is not met, `res_map` has a key-value pair where the key is (candy % k) and the value is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 if the key does not already exist. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block.***
