Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs based on the conditions specified in the loop. `res` is an integer representing the final result after the loop iterations. If the candy_array is empty, the loop will not execute and `res_map` will remain an empty dictionary and `res` will stay at 0.**
