Example Answer: 
The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is unknown, so the output state is: `res` is increased by 2, and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`res` is increased by 2, `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1**
