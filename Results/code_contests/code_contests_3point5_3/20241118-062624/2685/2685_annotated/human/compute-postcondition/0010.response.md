Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer incremented by 2, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is an integer incremented by 2, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies**
