The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` and `candy_array`. It iterates over the candies in `candy_array` and updates a result map based on certain conditions. If a specific condition is met, the result is incremented by 2 and the corresponding value in the map is decreased by 1. If the condition is not met, a new key-value pair is added to the map. The function does not have a return value specified. It is crucial to note that the code might encounter errors or unexpected behavior due to potential division by zero when calculating `k - candy % k` or `candy % k`. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input parameters do not meet the specified preconditions of `k` being a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `candy_array` containing positive integers in a specific range.
