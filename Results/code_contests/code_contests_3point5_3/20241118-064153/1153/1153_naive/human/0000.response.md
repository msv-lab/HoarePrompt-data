Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether the first card beats the second card according to the rules of the Durak card game. It checks if the first card has a higher rank and the same suit as the second card, or if the first card is a trump card. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
