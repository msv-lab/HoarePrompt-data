Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle the case where the first card is a trump card and the second card is a non-trump card. According to the rules of the game, a trump card can beat any non-trump card regardless of the rank. The code only checks if the suits are the same and compares the ranks, but it does not consider the trump suit. 

For example, if the input is:
```
S
AH 7D
```
The expected output should be "YES" since the first card is a trump card and should beat the non-trump card. However, the code will output "NO" because it only checks the suits and ranks without considering the trump suit. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
