Example Answer:
`r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `r1` is defined or assigned a value, `ts` is initialized, `m1` is an iterable object, and `r2` is 1.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `r1` is defined or assigned a value, `ts` is initialized, `m1` is an iterable object, `r2` is 1**
