Output State: **If m1 is not empty, the loop iterates over each element and checks if the first symbol of the card matches the first symbol of the first card in s2. If a match is found, r1 is assigned the value of the current iteration index i. If no match is found, r1 remains unchanged. If m1 is empty, the loop does not execute and r1 remains undefined.**
