Example Answer: 
`r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `r1` is defined or assigned a value, `ts` is initialized, `m1` has more elements to iterate over, `r2` is 2.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `r1` is defined or assigned a value, `ts` is initialized, `m1` has more elements to iterate over, `r2` is 2**
