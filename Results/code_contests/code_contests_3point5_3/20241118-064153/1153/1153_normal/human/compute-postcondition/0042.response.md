Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `i` is the total number of elements in `m1`, `r1` is assigned a value, `ts` is initialized, `m1` is an iterable object. If `ts` is not equal to `s2[1][0]`, then `r2` remains undefined. Additionally, if `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, the code prints 'YES'. If the condition `(s2[0][1] == s2[1][1] and r1 > r2)` is false, then 'NO' is printed. All edge cases are accounted for in the postcondition.***
