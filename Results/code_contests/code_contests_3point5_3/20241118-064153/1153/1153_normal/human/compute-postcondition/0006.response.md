Example Answer: 
`r1` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 0, so after execution, `r1` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string representing the trump suit, `s2` is a list of two strings with each string representing a card, `i` is 0, `m1` has at least 1 element, the first symbol of the first card in `s2` is equal to `ts`, and `r1` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a string representing the trump suit, `s2` is a list of two strings with each string representing a card, `i` is 0, `m1` has at least 1 element, the first symbol of the first card in `s2` is equal to `ts`, `r1` is 0**
