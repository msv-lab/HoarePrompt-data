Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing the trump suit, `s2` is a list of two strings representing different cards, `i` is 3, `m1` has at least 1 element. If the first character of the first card in `s2` matches the trump suit `s`, then `r1` is assigned the value of 3, otherwise `r1` remains unchanged.***
