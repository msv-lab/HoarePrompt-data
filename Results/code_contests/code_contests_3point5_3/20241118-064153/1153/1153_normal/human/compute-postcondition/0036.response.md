Output State: **`i` is the total number of elements in `m1`, `r1` is assigned a value, `ts` is initialized, `m1` is an iterable object. If `ts` is equal to `s2[1][0]`, then `r2` is assigned the index of the element in `m1` where the condition is met. If the condition is never met, `r2` remains undefined. `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` and `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s[0']`. 'YES' is printed.**
