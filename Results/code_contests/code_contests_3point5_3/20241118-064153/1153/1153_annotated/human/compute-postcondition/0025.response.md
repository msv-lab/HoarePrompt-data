According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m1`. If `m1` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `r1` remains unchanged, `s`, `s2`, `m1` are not empty. If `ts` is equal to the first element of the second element of `s2`, then `r2` is assigned the value of 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `m1` should still not be empty.
State: **Output State: `i` is 1, `r1` remains unchanged, `s`, `s2`, `m1` are not empty**
