Example Answer:
The `s2` list is assigned the result of splitting the input string. The input string is expected to contain two card strings separated by spaces. After splitting the input, the first card string is stored at index 0 of the list `s2` and the second card string is stored at index 1. 
Output State: **`s` is a string representing the trump suit, `s2` is a list of two strings representing different cards**
