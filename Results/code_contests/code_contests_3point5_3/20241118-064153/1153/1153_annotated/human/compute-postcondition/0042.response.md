Postcondition: ***`i` is the number of iterations, `r1` remains unchanged, `s`, `s2`, `m1` are not empty. If `ts` is equal to the first element of the second element of `s2` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, then `r2` is assigned the value of the current iteration number. If the loop does not execute, `r2` remains unchanged. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
