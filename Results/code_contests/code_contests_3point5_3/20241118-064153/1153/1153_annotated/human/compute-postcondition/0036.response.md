Output State: **`i` is the number of iterations, `r1` remains unchanged, `s`, `s2`, `m1` are not empty. If `ts` is equal to the first element of the second element of `s2`, and the second element of `s2` is not equal to the second element of the first element of `s2`, and the second element of `s2` is equal to the first element of `s`, then `r2` is assigned the value of the current iteration number. If the loop does not execute, `r2` remains unchanged.**
