According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m1`. If `m1` is not an empty iterable, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m1` is not empty. 
State: **`i` is 0, `r1` remains unchanged, `s`, `s2`, `m1` is not empty**
