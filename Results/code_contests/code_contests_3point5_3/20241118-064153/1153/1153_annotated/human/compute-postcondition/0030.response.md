Example Answer:
`r2` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 2, so after execution, `r2` is also 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `r1` remains unchanged, `s`, `s2`, `m1` are not empty, `r2` is 2 or remains unchanged based on condition.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `r1` remains unchanged, `s`, `s2`, `m1` are not empty, `r2` is 2 or remains unchanged based on condition**
