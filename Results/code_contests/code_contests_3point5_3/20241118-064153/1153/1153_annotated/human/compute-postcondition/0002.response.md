Example Answer:
The variable `m1` is assigned the string '6789TJQKA'. This assignment does not affect the values of `s` and `s2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string representing the trump suit, `s2` is a list of two strings representing different cards, `m1` is the string '6789TJQKA'.
Output State: **`s` is a string representing the trump suit, `s2` is a list of two strings representing different cards, `m1` is the string '6789TJQKA'**
