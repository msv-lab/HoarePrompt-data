Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly removes duplicate elements from the array while maintaining the rightmost occurrence of each unique element. It iterates through the array in reverse order, keeping track of the unique elements encountered so far using a set. If an element is already in the set, it is skipped, otherwise, it is added to the final array. Finally, it prints the count of unique elements and the array in the correct order. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
