The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array and a list of integers `a`. It then creates a new list `ans` containing unique elements from the reversed list `a`, while keeping track of unique elements using the set `vis`. Finally, it prints the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans` in reverse order. The function assumes `n` is a positive integer and `a` contains integers between 1 and 1000 inclusive. If `n` is 0, both `ans` and `vis` will be empty.
