Example Answer:
`ai` is the second last element in the reversed list `a`. `ans` appends `ai`, and if `ai` is not already in `vis`, it is added to `vis`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the second last element in the reversed list a, ans contains ai, and vis contains ai.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the second last element in the reversed list a, ans contains ai, and vis contains ai**
