According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a` and the set `vis`. If the last element in the reversed list `a` is not already in `vis`, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `ai` if `ai` is not already in `vis`, and `vis` is a set containing `ai`. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the last element `ai` in the reversed list `a` must not be already in `vis`. If `ai` is in `vis`, the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, `ai` should be appended to `ans` and added to `vis`.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans is a list containing ai if ai is not already in vis, and vis is a set containing ai (with ai added to vis if not already present)**.
