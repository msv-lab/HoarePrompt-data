Example Answer:
`ai` is added to the set `vis`. The value of `ai` is the second last element in the reversed list `a`, so it is added to the set `vis`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the second last element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains `ai`, and `vis` contains `ai`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the second last element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains `ai`, and `vis` contains `ai`**
