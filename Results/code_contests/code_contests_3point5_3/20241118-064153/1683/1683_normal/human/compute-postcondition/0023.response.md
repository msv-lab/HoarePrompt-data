Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will iterate through the list a, checking each element ai. If ai is not in vis, it will be appended to ans and added to vis. If ai is already in vis, the loop will continue to the next element without modifying ans or vis. The loop will not execute if n is 0.**

Output State: **If n is greater than 0, ans will contain unique elements from the reversed list a, vis will contain all unique elements from the list a. If n is 0, ans and vis will remain empty.**
