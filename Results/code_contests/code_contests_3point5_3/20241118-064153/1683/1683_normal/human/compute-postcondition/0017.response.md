According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a` and the set `vis`. If the loop is to execute one more time, the condition that needs to be met is that the next element `ai` in the list `a` should not already be in the set `vis`. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the second last element in the reversed list a, ans is a list containing ai if ai is not already in vis and vis is a set containing ai. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next `ai` should not already be in `vis`.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans is a list containing ai if ai is not already in vis and vis is a set containing ai**
