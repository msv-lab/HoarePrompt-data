Example Answer: 
`ai` is added to the set `vis`, and `ai` is the last element in the reversed list `a`. Therefore, after execution, `vis` contains `ai`. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans is a list containing ai, vis is a set containing ai**
