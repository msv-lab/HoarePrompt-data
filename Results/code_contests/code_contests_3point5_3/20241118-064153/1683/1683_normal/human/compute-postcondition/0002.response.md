Example Answer:
The list `a` is reversed using the `[::-1]` slicing technique. The order of elements in the list `a` is reversed. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in Petya's array; a is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, with elements reversed.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in Petya's array; a is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, with elements reversed**
