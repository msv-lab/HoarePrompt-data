Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the integers obtained by mapping the input from `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')` to integers. The number of elements in the list `a` is determined by the value of `n`, a positive integer representing the number of elements in Petya's array. The integers in list `a` will be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in Petya's array; a is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive**
