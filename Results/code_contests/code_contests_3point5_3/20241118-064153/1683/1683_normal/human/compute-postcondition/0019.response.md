Example Answer:
The last element of the reversed list `a` is appended to the `ans` list. If the last element `ai` is not already in the set `vis`, it is added to `vis`. The output state after execution is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans contains ai, and ai is added to vis if it is not already in vis.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans contains ai, and ai is added to vis if it is not already in vis**
