Example Answer:
`ai` is added to the set `vis` using the `add` method. If `ai` was not already in `vis`, it is added to `vis`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans contains ai, ai is added to vis if it is not already in vis.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans contains ai, ai is added to vis if it is not already in vis**
