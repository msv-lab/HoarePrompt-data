Example Answer:
If n is greater than 0, ans will contain unique elements from the reversed list a, vis will contain all unique elements from the list a. If n is 0, ans and vis will remain empty. The code prints the length of ans. Since no information is given about the initial state of variables, the output state will vary depending on the input provided when the code is executed.
Output State: **Dependent on the input provided**
