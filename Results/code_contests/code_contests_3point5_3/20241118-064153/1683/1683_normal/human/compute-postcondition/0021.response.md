Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans is a list containing ai if ai is not already in vis, and vis is a set containing ai. If ai is in vis, the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, ai is appended to ans and added to vis. The postcondition covers all edge cases related to the handling of ai in the context of vis and ans.***
