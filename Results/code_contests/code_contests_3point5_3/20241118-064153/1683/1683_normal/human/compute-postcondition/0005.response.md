According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, ans is empty list and vis is an empty set. To ensure the loop executes, n should be a positive integer, a should have at least 1 element, ai should be the last element in the reversed list a, ans should remain empty, and vis should remain empty.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, ai is the last element in the reversed list a, ans is an empty list, vis is an empty set**
