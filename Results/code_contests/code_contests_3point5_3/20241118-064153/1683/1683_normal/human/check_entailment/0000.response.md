Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description by removing duplicate elements from the array while keeping only the rightmost occurrence of each element. It then prints the length of the updated array and the elements in reverse order. The code uses a set to keep track of visited elements and a list to store the unique elements in the correct order. The output hints also agree with the code in terms of the functionality described. All the provided examples are correctly handled by the code as it removes duplicate elements and maintains the relative order of unique elements. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
