Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to remove duplicate elements from the array while keeping only the rightmost occurrence of each unique element. It reverses the array, iterates over it, and maintains a set to keep track of visited elements. It then appends unseen elements to a list and finally outputs the count of unique elements and the list in the correct format. The logic seems sound and there are no cases provided where the program doesn't meet the requirements of the problem description.
