The function reads an integer n from the standard input, then reads a list of integers a in reverse order. It removes duplicate elements from the list a while preserving the order of the elements. The function then prints the number of unique elements in a and the unique elements in reversed order. However, the annotations mention returning the maximum element in the array `a`, which is not part of the actual code. This missing functionality needs to be noted.
