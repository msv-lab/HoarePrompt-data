Example Answer: 
The element `ai` is appended to the list `ans`. Since `ai` represents the first element in array `a`, and `ai` is not present in the set `vis`, `ai` will be added to the `ans` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ai` represents the first element in array `a`, `ans` contains the first element in array `a`, `vis` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ai` represents the first element in array `a`, `ans` contains the first element in array `a`, `vis` is an empty set**
