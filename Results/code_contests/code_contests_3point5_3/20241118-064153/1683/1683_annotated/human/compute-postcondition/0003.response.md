Example Answer:
No elements are added to the `ans` list, so the `ans` list remains empty. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array `a`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000, the elements in array `a` are now in reverse order, and `ans` is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array `a`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000, the elements in array `a` are now in reverse order, `ans` is an empty list**
