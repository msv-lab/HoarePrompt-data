Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping each input element to an integer using the `map` function. The input is read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')`. Since the initial state only specifies that `n` is a positive integer, the specific elements in the array `a` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array `a`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array `a`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
