Example Answer:
`ai` is added to the set `vis`. The value of `ai` represents the first element in array `a`, and `ans` contains the first element in array `a`. Since `ai` is added to the set `vis`, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `ai` represents the first element in array `a`, `ans` contains the first element in array `a`, `vis` contains `ai`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ai` represents the first element in array `a`, `ans` contains the first element in array `a`, `vis` contains `ai`**
