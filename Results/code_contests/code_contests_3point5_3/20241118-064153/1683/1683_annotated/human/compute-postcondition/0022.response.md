According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `a`, `ai`, `vis`, and `ans`. If there are elements left in the list `a` that have not been visited yet, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. The conditions for adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time are:
1. If `ai` is not in `vis`, `ai` should be appended to `ans` and added to `vis`.
2. If `ai` is already in `vis`, `ans` should retain its previous values without any changes.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ai` should be a new element that has not been visited yet.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ai` is a new element that has not been visited yet, `vis` contains all visited elements, `ans` contains all appended elements**
