Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `ai` is in `vis`, the program continues without modifying `ans` or `vis`. If `ai` is not in `vis`, `ai` is appended to `ans`, and `ai` is added to `vis`. After the execution of the if-else block, `ans` contains all elements added so far, including `ai`, and `vis` contains all unique elements added so far, including `ai`.***
