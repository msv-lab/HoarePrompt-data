Example Answer: 
The value of `ai` is added to the set `vis`. Since `ai` is not in `vis`, it is added to the set. The `ans` variable contains the appended value of `ai`. After execution, the state will be: `n` is greater than 0, `ai` is in `vis`, and `ans` contains the appended value of `ai`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ai` is in `vis`, `ans` contains the appended value of `ai`**
