Example Answer:
`ai` is added to the list `ans`. The elements in `ans` are updated to include `ai`, and `ai` is no longer the next element in array `a` that is not in `vis`. The elements in `vis` are also updated to include `ai` as a unique element. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ai` is no longer the next element in array `a` that is not in `vis`, `ans` contains all elements added so far including `ai`, and `vis` contains all unique elements added so far.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ai` is no longer the next element in array `a` that is not in `vis`, `ans` contains all elements added so far including `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements added so far**
