According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in array `a` and the condition related to `vis`. If the next element `ai` in `a` is not already in the `vis` set, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `ai` represents the first element in array `a`, `ans` is a list containing `ai`, `vis` is a set containing the value of `ai`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next element `ai` should not be already in the `vis` set and it needs to be appended to `ans` and added to `vis`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ai` is the next element in array `a` that is not in `vis`, `ans` contains all elements added so far including `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements added so far**
