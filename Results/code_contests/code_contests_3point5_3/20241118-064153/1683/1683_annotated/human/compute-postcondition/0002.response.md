Example Answer:
The array `a` is reversed using the `[::-1]` slicing technique. This means that the elements in array `a` are now in reverse order. The previous values of the elements in array `a` are reversed according to the new order. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array `a`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and the elements in array `a` are now in reverse order.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array `a`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and the elements in array `a` are now in reverse order**
