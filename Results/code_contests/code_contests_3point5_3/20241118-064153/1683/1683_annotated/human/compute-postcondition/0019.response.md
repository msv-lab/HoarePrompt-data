Example Answer: 
The value of `ai` is appended to the list `ans`. The initial state specifies that `ai` is not in the list `vis`, so `ai` is a unique value being added to `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ai` is not in `vis`, `ans` contains the appended value of `ai`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ai` is not in `vis`, `ans` contains the appended value of `ai`**
