Output State: **If array `a` is empty, `ans` and `vis` will remain empty. If `a` has elements, `ans` will contain all unique elements in `a` in the order they appear (due to the reverse order of `a`), and `vis` will contain all unique elements added to `ans` so far. The length of `ans` will be printed.**
