Example Answer:
`ai` is added to the set `vis`. The set `vis` now contains `ai` in addition to all unique elements added so far. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ai` is no longer the next element in array `a` that is not in `vis`, `ans` contains all elements added so far including `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements added so far including `ai`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ai` is no longer the next element in array `a` that is not in `vis`, `ans` contains all elements added so far including `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements added so far including `ai`**
