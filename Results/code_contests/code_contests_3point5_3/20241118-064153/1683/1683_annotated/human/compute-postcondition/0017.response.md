According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. If `ai` is in `vis`, the program continues without modifying `ans` or `vis`. If `ai` is not in `vis`, `ai` is appended to `ans`, and `ai` is added to `vis`. After the execution of the if-else block, `ans` contains all elements added so far, including `ai`, and `vis` contains all unique elements added so far, including `ai`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ai` should not be in `vis` in order to be appended to `ans` and added to `vis`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0. `ai` is not in `vis`**
