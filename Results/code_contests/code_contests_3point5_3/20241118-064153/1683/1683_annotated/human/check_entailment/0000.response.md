Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly by taking the number of elements in the array and the array itself.
2. It then reverses the array `a` to start removing duplicates from the rightmost entry.
3. It maintains a set `vis` to keep track of unique elements encountered.
4. It iterates through the reversed array `a` and appends elements to the `ans` array only if they are not already in the `vis` set, thereby keeping only the rightmost occurrence of each element.
5. Finally, it prints the length of the `ans` array and then prints the elements in the `ans` array in the correct order.

The program correctly implements the logic of removing duplicate elements and retaining only the rightmost occurrence of each element in the array. It handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
