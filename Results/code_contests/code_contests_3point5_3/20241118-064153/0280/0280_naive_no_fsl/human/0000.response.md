Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The `func_10` function is supposed to determine the minimal number of moves required to make each regiment compact, but it does not follow the logic outlined in the problem statement. Additionally, the implementation of `func_11` and `func_12` does not align with the requirements for rotating the moles around their home points to form a square. There are also issues with the input/output functions and the overall structure of the program. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
