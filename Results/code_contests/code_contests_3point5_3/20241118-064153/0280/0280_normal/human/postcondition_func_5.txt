The function `func_6` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It first ensures that both `x` and `y` are positive by taking their absolute values. Then, it checks if the minimum value between `x` and `y` is 0. If this condition is met, the function returns the maximum value between `x` and `y`. Otherwise, it enters a while loop where it calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. Finally, the function returns the value of `x` after this operation. Therefore, the functionality includes handling cases where either `x` or `y` are negative to ensure positive values are used in the computation.
