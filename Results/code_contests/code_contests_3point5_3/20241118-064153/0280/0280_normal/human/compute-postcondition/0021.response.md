Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True` except for indices `i` where they are `False`, `p` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`, and the loop will execute at least once. If `p` is less than or equal to 1 or `n` is less than `p * p`, the loop will not execute.**
