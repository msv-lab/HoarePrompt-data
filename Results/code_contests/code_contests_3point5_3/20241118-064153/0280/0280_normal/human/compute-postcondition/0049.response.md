Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` remain unchanged. An empty list `f` is created. `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the element at index `p` in `prime` is true, then the value of `p` is appended to list `f`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `f` remains empty.**
