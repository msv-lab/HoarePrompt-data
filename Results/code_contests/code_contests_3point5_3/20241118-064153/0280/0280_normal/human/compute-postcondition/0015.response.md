Example Answer:
The value of `prime[i]` is changed to `False`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True` except for index `i` where it is `False`, `p` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p` and the range specified allows the loop to run at least once.
