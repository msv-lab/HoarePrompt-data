Postcondition: ***All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for indices `i` where they are `False`. The value of `p` is increased by 1. If `prime[p]` is True, then for every index `i` in the range from `p * p` to `n`, inclusive, with a step of `p`, the element at index `i` in the list `prime` is set to False. If `p` is less than or equal to 1 or `n` is less than `p * p`, no elements in the list `prime` are changed.***
