According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **All elements of the list `prime` are `True`, `p` is assigned the value 2, the element at index `p` in the list `prime` is `True`, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`, and `i` is `p * p`.**
