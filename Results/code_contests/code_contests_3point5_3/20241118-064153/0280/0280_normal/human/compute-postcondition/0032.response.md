Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for the indices `i` where they are `False`. If `p` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. As `p` is increased by 1 in each iteration, the loop sets the values in the list `prime` from index `p * p` to `n` to `False`.**
