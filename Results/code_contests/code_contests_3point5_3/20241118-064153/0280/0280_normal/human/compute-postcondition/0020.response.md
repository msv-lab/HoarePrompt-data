According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements of the list `prime` are initially `True` except for index `i` where it is `False`, `p` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p + p`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n + 1`.
State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True` except for index `i` where it is `False`, `p` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p + p`, `i` is less than `n + 1`**
