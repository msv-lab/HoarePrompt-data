According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `p` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements of the list `prime` remain unchanged, an empty list `f` is created, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `p` should be less than `n`, so `p` needs to be adjusted to `p+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements of the list `prime` remain unchanged, an empty list `f` is created, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p` is equal to `p+1**.
