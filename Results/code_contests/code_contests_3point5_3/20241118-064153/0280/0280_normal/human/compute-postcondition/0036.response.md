Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for indices `i` where they are `False` based on the conditions met. The value of `p` is increased according to the loop logic. If `p` is less than or equal to 1 or `n` is less than `p * p`, no elements in the list `prime` are changed.**
