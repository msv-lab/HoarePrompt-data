Postcondition: ***All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`. After the if statement, if `prime[p]` is `True`, then for all indices `i` in the range from `p * p` to `n` (inclusive) with step size `p`, the elements at those indices are set to `False`. Additionally, if `n` is less than `p * p`, no elements are modified. The value of `p` is set to 2.***
