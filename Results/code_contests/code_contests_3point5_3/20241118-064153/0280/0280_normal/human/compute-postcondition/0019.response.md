Example Answer: 
The value of `prime[i]` is changed to `False`, while all other elements of the list `prime` remain `True`. The values of `p`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this change. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True` except for index `i` where it is `False`, `p` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p + p`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True` except for index `i` where it is `False`, `p` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p + p`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`**
