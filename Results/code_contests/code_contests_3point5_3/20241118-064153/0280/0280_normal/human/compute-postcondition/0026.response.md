Example Answer: 
The value of `prime[i]` is set to `False`, affecting the state of the list `prime`. The list `prime` now has all elements as `True` except for the index `i` where it is set to `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for the index `i` where it is `False`, `p` is increased by 1, values in the list `prime` from index `p * p` to `n` are set to `True`.
Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for the index `i` where it is `False`, `p` is increased by 1, values in the list `prime` from index `p * p` to `n` are set to `True`**
