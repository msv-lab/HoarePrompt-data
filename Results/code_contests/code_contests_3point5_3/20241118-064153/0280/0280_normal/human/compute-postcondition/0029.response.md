According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the index `i` is within the range of `p * p` to `n` with a step size of `p`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for the index `p * p` where it is `False`, `p` is increased by 1, and values in the list `prime` from index `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` to `n` are set to `True`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `p` needs to be increased by 1, and the values in the list `prime` from index `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` to `n` need to be set to `True`.
State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for the index `p * p` where it is `False`, `p` is increased by 1, values in the list `prime` from index `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` to `n` are set to `True`, `p` is further increased by 1**
