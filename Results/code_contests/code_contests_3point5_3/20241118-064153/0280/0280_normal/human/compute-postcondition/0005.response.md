According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is assigned the value 2, all elements of the list `prime` are `True`, the element at index `p` in the list `prime` is `False`, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`, and `i` is `p * p`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, which is `i + p`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements of the list `prime` are `True`, `p` is assigned the value 2, the element at index `p` in the list `prime` is `False`, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`, and `i` is `p * p + p**`.
