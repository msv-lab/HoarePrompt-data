Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in the list `prime` is set to `False`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for the index `p * p` where it is `False`, `p` is increased by 1, values in the list `prime` from index `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` to `n` are set to `True`, `p` is further increased by 1.
Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for the index `p * p` where it is `False`, `p` is increased by 1, values in the list `prime` from index `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` to `n` are set to `True`, `p` is further increased by 1**
