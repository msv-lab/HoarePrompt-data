According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `n`. If the square of `p` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `p` is increased by 1. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, the new value of `p` needs to be such that its square is still less than or equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, the value of `p` is increased by 1**
