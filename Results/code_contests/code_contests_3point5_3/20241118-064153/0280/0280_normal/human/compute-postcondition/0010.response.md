Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` are `True` except for the elements at indices that are multiples of 2, `p` is assigned the value 2, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`, and the elements at indices that are multiples of 2 starting from `p * p` are set to `False`. If `n` is less than `p * p`, the loop does not execute.**
