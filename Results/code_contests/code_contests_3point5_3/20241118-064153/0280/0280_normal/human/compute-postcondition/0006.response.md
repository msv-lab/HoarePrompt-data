Example Answer:
The element at index `i` in the list `prime` is set to `False`. Since `i` is equal to `p * p + p`, which is equivalent to `2 * 2 + 2 = 6`, the element at index `6` in the list `prime` will be set to `False`. Therefore, the output state is: All elements of the list `prime` are `True`, `p` is assigned the value 2, the element at index `p` in the list `prime` is `False`, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`, and the element at index `6` in the list `prime` is `False`.
Output State: **All elements of the list `prime` are `True`, `p` is assigned the value 2, the element at index `p` in the list `prime` is `False`, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`, and the element at index `6` in the list `prime` is `False**.
