According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p` and `n`. If `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `p` was increased by 1. To execute the loop again, `p` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for indices `i` where they are `False`. The value of `p` is increased by 1.**
