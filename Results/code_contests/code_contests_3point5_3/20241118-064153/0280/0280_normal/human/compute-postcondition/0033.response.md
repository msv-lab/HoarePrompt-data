Postcondition: ***All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True`, except for the indices `i` where they are `False`. After the execution of the if block, if `p` is less than or equal to 1, there is no change in the list `prime`. Otherwise, starting from index `p * p` up to `n`, all elements in the list `prime` are set to `False` for indices that are multiples of `p`. The value of `p` is increased by 1 after the execution.***
