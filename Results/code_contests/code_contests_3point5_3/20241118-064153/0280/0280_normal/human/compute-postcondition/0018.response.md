According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the `i` value in the range must be less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p + p`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` in the range should be less than `n + 1`. This means `i` should be less than or equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements of the list `prime` are initially `True` except for index `i` where it is `False`, `p` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p + p`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`**
