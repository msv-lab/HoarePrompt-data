The function func_8 accepts a positive integer n and generates a list f containing prime numbers up to n. It utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers in the prime list as False. The function then collects the indices of the remaining True values in the prime list and returns them in the list f. If n is less than 2, the function returns an empty list.
