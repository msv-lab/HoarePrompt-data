The function func_7 accepts a positive integer n and returns a list containing all factors of n. If n is not a perfect square, factors will be in pairs. If n is a perfect square, only the square root of n will be present in the list. If n is less than 1, the list will remain empty. The function correctly identifies factors of n and handles perfect square cases. However, it does not handle negative integers as input, and as a result, it may not provide accurate results in such cases.
