The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `p`. It calculates and returns the result of n raised to the power of p-2 modulo p. The function assumes that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `p` is an integer. The functionality of the function is to perform the specified modular exponentiation calculation.
