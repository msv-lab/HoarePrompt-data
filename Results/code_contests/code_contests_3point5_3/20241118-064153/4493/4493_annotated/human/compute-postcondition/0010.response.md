Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, `arr` contains the integers inputted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `count` is 2.0. For some i in the range of `arr`, if `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5, `count` increases by 1.0. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `count` are maintained according to the initial conditions, and the relationship between them is consistent after the if statement is executed. All edge cases, including the boundaries of `k`, have been considered.***
