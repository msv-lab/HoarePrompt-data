Output State: 
If arr is empty, the loop does not execute, and count remains 0.0. Otherwise, for each element in arr, if the element plus k is less than or equal to 5, count increases by 1.0. The final count represents the number of elements in arr that satisfy this condition.
Therefore, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in arr, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, `arr` contains the integers inputted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, and `count` is the number of elements in arr where the element plus k is less than or equal to 5.
