Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of elements in a list `arr` and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 5. It then reads `n` integers into the list `arr`. After that, it iterates through the elements of `arr`, incrementing `count` by 1 for each element that satisfies a specific condition. Finally, it prints the integer value of `count` divided by 3, rounded down. The function does not return any specific output. **
