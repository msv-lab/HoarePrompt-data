Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are converted to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are already positive integers, so the conversion does not change their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2000 and 1 <= k <= 5.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2000 and 1 <= k <= 5**
