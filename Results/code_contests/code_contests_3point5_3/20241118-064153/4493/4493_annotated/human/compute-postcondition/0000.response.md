Example Answer:
n and k are assigned the values from the input split by a space. Since the inputs are positive integers, the values of n and k will be positive integers as well. Therefore, the output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2000 and 1 <= k <= 5. The list arr contains n integers representing the number of times each student has participated in the ACM ICPC world championship, where each yi is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 5.
