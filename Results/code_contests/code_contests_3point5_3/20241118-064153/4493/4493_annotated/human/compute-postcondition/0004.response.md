According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, `arr` contains the integers inputted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `count` is 0.0**
