Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in arr, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, `arr` contains the integers inputted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `count` is the number of elements in arr where the element plus k is less than or equal to 5. The program prints the integer value of count divided by 3 after flooring it.**
