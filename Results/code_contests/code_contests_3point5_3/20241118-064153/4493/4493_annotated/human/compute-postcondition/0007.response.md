Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, `arr` contains the integers inputted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `count` is 1.0, and for some i in the range of `arr`, `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5. The count is increased by 1.0 for each element in `arr` that satisfies the condition `arr[i] + k <= 5`.***
