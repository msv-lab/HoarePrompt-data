You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Saratov State University Olympiad Programmers Training Center (SSU OPTC) has n students. For each student you know the number of times he/she has participated in the ACM ICPC world programming championship. According to the ACM ICPC rules, each person can participate in the world championship at most 5 times.

The head of the SSU OPTC is recently gathering teams to participate in the world championship. Each team must consist of exactly three people, at that, any person cannot be a member of two or more teams. What maximum number of teams can the head make if he wants each team to participate in the world championship with the same members at least k times?

Input

The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 5). The next line contains n integers: y1, y2, ..., yn (0 ≤ yi ≤ 5), where yi shows the number of times the i-th person participated in the ACM ICPC world championship.

Output

Print a single number — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

5 2
0 4 5 1 0


Output

Input

6 4
0 1 2 3 4 5


Output

Input

6 5
0 0 0 0 0 0


Output

2

Note

In the first sample only one team could be made: the first, the fourth and the fifth participants.

In the second sample no teams could be created.

In the third sample two teams could be created. Any partition into two teams fits.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n, k = raw_input().split()
    n, k = int(n), int(k)
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    count = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] + k <= 5:
            count += 1.0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in arr, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, `arr` contains the integers inputted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `count` is the number of elements in arr where the element plus k is less than or equal to 5.
    print(int(math.floor(count / 3)))

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
