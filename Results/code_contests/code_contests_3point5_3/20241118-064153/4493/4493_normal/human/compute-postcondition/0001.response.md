Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are converted to integers using the `int()` function. The initial values of `n` and `k` are input integers, so they are converted to integers without any change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer**
