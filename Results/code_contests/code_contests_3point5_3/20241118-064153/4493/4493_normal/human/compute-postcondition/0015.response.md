Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. The loop checks if the sum of arr[i] and k is less than or equal to 5, and if so, count is increased by 1.0. After the loop executes, count will be the total number of elements in arr where the sum of the element and k is less than or equal to 5. If n is 0, the loop won't execute, and count will remain 0.0**
