Example Answer:
The variable `arr` is assigned the values obtained from mapping the integers inputted through `raw_input().split()`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer**
