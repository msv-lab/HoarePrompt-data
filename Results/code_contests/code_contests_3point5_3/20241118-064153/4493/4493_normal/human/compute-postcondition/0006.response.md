Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` is initially 0.0, after execution, `count` becomes 1.0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, k is an integer, count is 1.0, and the sum of arr[i] and k is less than or equal to 5.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is an integer, count is 1.0, the sum of arr[i] and k is less than or equal to 5**
