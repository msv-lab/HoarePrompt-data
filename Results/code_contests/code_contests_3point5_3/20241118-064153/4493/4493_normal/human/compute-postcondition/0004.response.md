According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `count` being 0.0 does not affect the execution of the loop. So, to ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `k` is an integer.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `count` is 0.0**
