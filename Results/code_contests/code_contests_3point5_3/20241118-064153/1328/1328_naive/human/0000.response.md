Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles the input cases where the total weight C is at least half of the knapsack size W but does not exceed it. It checks for items that can be directly put into the knapsack and also handles cases where the sum of weights of items is within the required range by selecting a subset of items. The program outputs the correct list of items or -1 if no solution is possible. All the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.
