Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and then written to the file. The previous values of the variables are `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start`. Since the code does not affect these variables, the output state remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are positive integers, and if `at_start` is False, then the program writes `sep` to the file.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are positive integers, and if `at_start` is False, then the program writes `sep` to the file**
