Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The variables `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file; otherwise, nothing is written. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are positive integers, and if `at_start` is False, then the program writes `sep` to the file.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are positive integers, and if `at_start` is False, then the program writes `sep` to the file**
