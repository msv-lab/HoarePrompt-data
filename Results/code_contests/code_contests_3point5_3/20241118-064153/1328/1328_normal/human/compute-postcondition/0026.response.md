Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing each element to a file. It handles the case where `at_start` is True or False, writing the separator `sep` if needed. It then writes the `end` character to the file. Additionally, it flushes the file if the `flush` parameter is True. However, the code lacks the initialization of `args` and `kwargs`, which might lead to errors during execution.**
