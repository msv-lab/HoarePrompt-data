Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` function writes the value of `sep` to the file. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: *t, n, W, w_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are positive integers, at_start is False, args is not empty.*
Output State: **t, n, W, w_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are positive integers, at_start is False, args is not empty**
