According to the code, the loop will execute for each x in args. Since the loop is dependent on the elements in args, we need to ensure that args is not empty. 
For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, W is a positive integer, w_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are positive integers, at_start is True, args is not empty**
