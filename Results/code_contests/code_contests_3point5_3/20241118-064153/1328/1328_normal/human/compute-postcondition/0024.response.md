Postcondition: ***If the loop executes, `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are positive integers. If `at_start` is False, then the program writes `sep` to the file. If `at_start` is True, the loop does not execute. Regardless of the condition, after the execution of the if statement, the variables `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` remain the same.***
