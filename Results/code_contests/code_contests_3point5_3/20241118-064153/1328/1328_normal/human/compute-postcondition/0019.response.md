According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arguments `args`. If there are more elements in `args`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `at_start` is False, the string stored in `sep` is written to the file. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `at_start` should be True, the string stored in `sep` should not be written to the file, and the file state should be updated accordingly.

State: **If `at_start` is True, the string stored in `sep` is not yet written to the file, and the file state is updated.**
