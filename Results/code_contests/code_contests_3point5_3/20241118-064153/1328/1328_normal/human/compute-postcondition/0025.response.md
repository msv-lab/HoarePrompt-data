The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for handling multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of items, the capacity of the knapsack, and the weights of the items. The function should read the input for the number of test cases, iterate through each test case, read the values for n, W, and the weights w_i, and then perform the necessary calculations or operations based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It handles multiple test cases where each test case includes the number of items, the capacity of the knapsack, and the weights of the items. The function reads the input for each test case and performs the required operations based on the inputs.**
