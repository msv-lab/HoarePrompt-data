According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list still has elements left, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are positive integers, and if `at_start` is False, then the program writes `sep` to the file. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `args` list must still have elements left. No other states need to be adjusted.
