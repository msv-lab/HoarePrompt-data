Example Answer: 
The `flush()` method is called on the file object, which flushes the internal buffer, so any unwritten data is written to the file. The variables `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` remain the same.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` remain the same**
