Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since this assignment does not affect the other variables, the output state is:
Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the number of items, W is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack, w_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are positive integers representing the weights of the items, at_start is True**
