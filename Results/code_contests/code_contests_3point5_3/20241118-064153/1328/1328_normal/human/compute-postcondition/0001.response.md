Example Answer:
The code snippet does not affect the initial state variables t, n, W, or w_i. It assigns the values ' ' to sep and sys.stdout to file, with default values if not provided. Therefore, the output state is: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the number of items, W is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack, w_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are positive integers representing the weights of the items.
Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the number of items, W is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack, w_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are positive integers representing the weights of the items**
