Example Answer: 
If `at_start` is True, then the variables `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i` remain the same. If `at_start` is False, then the string stored in the variable `sep` is written to the file. The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i` remains unchanged, and if `at_start` was False, the string stored in `sep` is written to the file.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` remain the same if `at_start` is True. If `at_start` is False, the string stored in `sep` is written to the file**
