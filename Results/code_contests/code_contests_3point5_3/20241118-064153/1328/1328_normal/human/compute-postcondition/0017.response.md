Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file. The values of `at_start`, `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i` remain unchanged. If `at_start` is False, the string representation of `x` is written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: If `at_start` is True, `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` remain unchanged. If `at_start` is False, the string stored in `sep` is written to the file, and the file state is updated.
Output State: **If `at_start` is True, `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` remain unchanged. If `at_start` is False, the string stored in `sep` is written to the file, and the file state is updated.**
