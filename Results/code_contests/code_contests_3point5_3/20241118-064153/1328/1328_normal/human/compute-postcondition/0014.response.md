According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `args` list. If there are more elements to iterate over, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `at_start` is True, then no states need to be adjusted and the loop can execute again. 

If `at_start` is False, then the state that needs to be adjusted is `sep` being written to the file. 

State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` remain the same if `at_start` is True. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file**
