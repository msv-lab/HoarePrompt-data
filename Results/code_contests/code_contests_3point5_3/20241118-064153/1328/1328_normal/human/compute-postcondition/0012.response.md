Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and then written to the file. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` remain the same if `at_start` is True. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` remain the same if `at_start` is True. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file**
