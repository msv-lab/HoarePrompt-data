Example Answer:
The provided code snippet is a docstring that does not affect the variables or program execution. The initial state remains the same with t as a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n as a positive integer representing the number of items, W as a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack, and w_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) as positive integers representing the weights of the items.
Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of items, W is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack. w_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are positive integers representing the weights of the items.**
