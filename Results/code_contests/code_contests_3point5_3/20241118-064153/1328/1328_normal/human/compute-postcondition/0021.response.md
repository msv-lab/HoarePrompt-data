Example Answer:
The `write` method writes the value popped from `kwargs` dictionary, which is 'end' by default '\n', to the file. The loop does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: If the loop executes, `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are positive integers. If `at_start` is False, then the program writes `sep` to the file. If `at_start` is True, the loop does not execute.
Output State: **If the loop executes, `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, and `at_start` are positive integers. If `at_start` is False, then the program writes `sep` to the file. If `at_start` is True, the loop does not execute.**
