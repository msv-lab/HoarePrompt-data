Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `W`, followed by the weights of the items.
- It then iterates through the items, checking if any single item's weight falls within the required range of ⌈ W/2⌉ and W. If such an item is found, it outputs that item's index. This covers the case where a single item can fulfill the conditions.
- If no single item satisfies the conditions, the code then iterates through all items, trying to find a combination of items whose total weight is within the required range. It keeps adding items to the knapsack until the total weight reaches at least ⌈ W/2⌉. If such a combination is found, it outputs the indices of those items. 
- If no combination of items can meet the requirements, it outputs -1. This covers the case where it is impossible to fulfill the conditions.

Overall, the code covers all the possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each of them. The logic of checking single items and combinations of items to fill the knapsack within the specified constraints is correctly implemented.
