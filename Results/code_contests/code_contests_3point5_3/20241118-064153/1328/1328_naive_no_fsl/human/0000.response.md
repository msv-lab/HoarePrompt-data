Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, knapsack capacity, and weights of items.
2. It then checks if there is an item that can be placed directly in the knapsack to satisfy the conditions.
3. If not, it iterates through the items and selects a combination of items that meet the criteria.
4. If there is no solution, it outputs -1 as required.
5. The code logic follows the problem description and covers all potential cases.
