Example Answer:
`x` is converted to a string and then written to `file`. The value of `sep` remains ' ', `file` remains `sys.stdout`, `at_start` remains False, and `args` remains unchanged. If `at_start` was not True, then `sep` would have been written to `file`. 
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements**
