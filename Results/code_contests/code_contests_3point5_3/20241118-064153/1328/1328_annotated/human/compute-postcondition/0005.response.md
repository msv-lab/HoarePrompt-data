Example Answer: 
The `write` method of the `file` object is called with the separator `sep`, which is a space character. This will write a space to the output. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element**
