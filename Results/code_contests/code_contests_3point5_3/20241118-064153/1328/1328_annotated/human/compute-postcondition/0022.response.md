Postcondition: ***The loop will iterate through the elements in args and write each element to the file. If at_start is False, the separator (sep) will be written before each element. The value of at_start will be False after the loop execution. If args is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and at_start will remain True. The 'flush' key is popped from kwargs and its value is True.***
