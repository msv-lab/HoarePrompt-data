Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to `file` before writing `x`. The value of `sep` is ' ', and the value of `at_start` is False. Therefore, `sep` will be written to `file` before `x` is written. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to `file`, and the string representation of `x` is written to `file`.**
