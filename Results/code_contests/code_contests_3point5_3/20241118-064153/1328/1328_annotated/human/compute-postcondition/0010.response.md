Example Answer: 
The code writes the value of `sep` to the file object `file`. The value of `sep` is a space ' ', so the space will be written to the standard output. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements**
