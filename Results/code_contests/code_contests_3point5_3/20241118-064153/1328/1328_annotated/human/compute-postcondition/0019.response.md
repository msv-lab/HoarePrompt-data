According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `args` list. If there are more elements left in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements. To execute the loop one more time, `args` must have at least 4 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 4 elements**
