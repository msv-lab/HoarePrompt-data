The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the preconditions specified for the function. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases involving a knapsack problem. The function does not return a specific value, but it likely calculates the maximum weight that can be carried in the knapsack based on the given inputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but relies on the preconditions specified for the number of test cases, the number of items, the capacity of the knapsack, and the weights of the items. It likely calculates the maximum weight that can be carried in the knapsack for each test case.**
