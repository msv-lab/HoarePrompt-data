Functionality: **The function func_2 does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the presence of 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' keys in kwargs. It iterates through the elements in args and writes each element to the file. If 'flush' is True, the file is flushed. If args is empty, the loop does not execute.**
