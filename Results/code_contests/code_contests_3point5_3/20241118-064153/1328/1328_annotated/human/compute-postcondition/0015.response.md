Example Answer:
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the `sep` value, which is a space character ' '. The `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sep` is ' ', `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least 3 elements. The `write` method does not change the state of any variables, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements**
