According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `args`. The initial state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted so that `args` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, `args` has at least 1 element**
