Example Answer:
`at_start` is already False, so assigning False to `at_start` does not change its value. Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements**
