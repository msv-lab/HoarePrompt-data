According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `args` list. If there is at least one more element in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `args` list must have at least 2 elements in it.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements**
