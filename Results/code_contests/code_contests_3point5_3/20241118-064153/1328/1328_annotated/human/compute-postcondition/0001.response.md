Example Answer:
The values for `sep` and `file` are retrieved from the `kwargs` dictionary using the `pop` method with default values of `' '` for `sep` and `sys.stdout` for `file`. The `pop` method removes the specified key-value pairs from the dictionary. Since the values were successfully retrieved and removed, the output state is: `sep` is ' ' and `file` is `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`**
