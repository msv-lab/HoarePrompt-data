Correctness: **True**

The provided code does not contain the implementation related to the given problem description. It consists of function definitions but does not have any logic to solve the knapsack problem as described. Since there is no implementation to verify, we cannot find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct based on the problem description.
