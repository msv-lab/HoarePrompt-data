Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The code is supposed to convert the given text back to the initial array using the described method, but it fails to do so.

The issues in the code are as follows:
1. The code does not handle the conversion of the reversed binary notation back to ASCII code as described in the problem.
2. The code uses the `print` statement incorrectly by trying to apply the modulo operation directly to it.
3. The code lacks the logic to correctly reverse the binary notation and calculate the actual ASCII code of the character to be printed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
