Example Answer:
The value of `binary` is assigned the reversed string of `s`. The value of `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text padded to 8 digits. Therefore, the output state is: `input` contains at least 2 characters, `prev` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `c` is the next character in the input text, `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text padded to 8 digits, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`.
Output State: **`input` contains at least 2 characters, `prev` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `c` is the next character in the input text, `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text padded to 8 digits, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`**
