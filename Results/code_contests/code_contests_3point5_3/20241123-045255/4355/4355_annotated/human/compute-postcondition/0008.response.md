Example Answer:
The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`. The value of `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the first character `c` in the input text. The rest of the variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`input` is a string containing ASCII characters between 32 and 126 with at least 1 character, `prev` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the first character in the input text, `c` is the first character in the input text, `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of `c` padded to 8 digits, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`, and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 is printed**
