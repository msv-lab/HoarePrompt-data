According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the input. At the end of the last iteration, `input` contains at least 2 characters, `prev` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `c` is the next character in the input text, `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text padded to 8 digits, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`. To execute one more time, the `input` should contain at least 1 more character, and the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`input` contains at least 1 character, `prev` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `c` is the next character in the input text, `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text padded to 8 digits, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`**
