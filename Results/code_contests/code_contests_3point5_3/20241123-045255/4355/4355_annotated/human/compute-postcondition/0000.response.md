Example Answer:
The dictionary `table` is defined with key-value pairs where each key is a character and its corresponding value is an integer. After execution, the dictionary `table` contains the following mappings:
- '>': 8
- '<': 9
- '+': 10
- '-': 11
- '.': 12
- ',': 13
- '[': 14
- ']': 15

Output State: **The input text is a string containing ASCII characters between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde). The dictionary `table` is defined with the mappings: {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}**
