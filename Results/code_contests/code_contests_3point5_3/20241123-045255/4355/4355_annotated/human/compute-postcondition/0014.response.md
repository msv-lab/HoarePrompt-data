Example Answer: 
The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`, which is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text. The output state does not change the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` contains at least 2 characters, `prev` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `c` is the next character in the input text, `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text padded to 8 digits, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`.
Output State: **`input` contains at least 2 characters, `prev` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `c` is the next character in the input text, `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text padded to 8 digits, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`**
