Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value `0`. The dictionary `table` with the mappings is already defined. Therefore, the Output State is: The input text is a string containing ASCII characters between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde); `prev` is `0`.
Output State: **The input text is a string containing ASCII characters between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde); `prev` is `0`**
