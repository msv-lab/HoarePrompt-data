Functionality: **The function `func` processes each character in the input text, calculates the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the character, subtracts it from the previous integer value, and prints the result after taking the modulo 256. If the input text is empty, the loop does not execute, and `prev` remains 0. The function does not accept any parameters and operates independently.**
