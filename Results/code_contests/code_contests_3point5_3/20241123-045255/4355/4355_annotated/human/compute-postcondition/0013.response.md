Example Answer:
The code subtracts the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text from the value of `prev`, then calculates the modulo 256 of the result, and finally prints the output. The output state remains the same as the initial state since the variables are not reassigned.
Output State: **`input` contains at least 2 characters, `prev` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `c` is the next character in the input text, `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text padded to 8 digits, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of the next character in the input text, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`**
