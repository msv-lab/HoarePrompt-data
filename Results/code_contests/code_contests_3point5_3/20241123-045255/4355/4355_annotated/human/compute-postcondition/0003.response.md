According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input text. If the input text has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `prev` is `0` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `input` is a string containing ASCII characters between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde) with at least 1 character, and `c` is the first character in the input text.
State: **`input` is a string containing ASCII characters between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde) with at least 1 character, `prev` is `0`, `c` is the first character in the input text**
