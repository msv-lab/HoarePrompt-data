Example Answer:
The character `c` is converted to its ASCII value using `ord(c)`, then the ASCII value is converted to binary using `bin()`. The binary value is then formatted to have a width of 8 characters with zeros padded at the beginning if necessary. The width is determined by the length of the binary representation of the ASCII value. The initial state indicates that `table` contains mappings for characters to integer values, `prev` is 0, and `c` is the first character in `input`. The output state will be the same as the initial state with the addition of the binary formatted value of the first character stored in `s`.
Output State: **`table` contains mappings for specific characters to integer values for all characters in `input`, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character in `input`, `s` is the binary formatted value of the first character**
