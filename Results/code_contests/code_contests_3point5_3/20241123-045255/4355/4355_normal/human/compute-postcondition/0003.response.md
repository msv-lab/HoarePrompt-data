According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `input`. If the input is a non-empty sequence, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the dictionary `table` should have mappings for all the characters present in the `input` sequence and `prev` should be set to 0. Additionally, the loop should start with `c` being the first character in the `input` sequence.
State: **`table` contains mappings for specific characters to integer values for all characters in `input`, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character in `input`**
