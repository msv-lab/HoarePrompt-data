Example Answer:
The binary value of the first character `c` is stored in `s`. The reverse of `s` is stored in `binary`. The integer value of `binary` in base 2 is stored in `integer`. Therefore, the Output State is: `table` contains mappings for specific characters to integer values for all characters in `input`, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character in `input`, `s` is the binary formatted value of the first character, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2.
Output State: **`table` contains mappings for specific characters to integer values for all characters in `input`, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character in `input`, `s` is the binary formatted value of the first character, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2**
