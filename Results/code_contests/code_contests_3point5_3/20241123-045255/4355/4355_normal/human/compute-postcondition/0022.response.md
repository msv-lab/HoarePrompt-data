Output State: **`table` contains mappings for specific characters to integer values for all characters in `input`, `prev` is the integer value of the last `binary` in base 2, `c` is the last character in `input`, `s` is the binary formatted value of the last character, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of the last `binary` in base 2, and the result of `print(prev - integer) % 256` is displayed. The loop will not execute if `input` is an empty string. In that case, `table` remains the same, and `prev` remains 0.**
