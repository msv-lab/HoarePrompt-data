According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more characters left in the `input` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the first character in `input`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next character in `input` needs to be processed. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`table` contains mappings for specific characters to integer values for all characters in `input`, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `c` is the next character in `input`, `s` is the binary formatted value of the next character, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, and the result of `print(prev - integer) % 256` is displayed**
