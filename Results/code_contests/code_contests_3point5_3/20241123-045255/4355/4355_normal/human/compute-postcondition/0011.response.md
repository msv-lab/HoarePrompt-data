Example Answer:
The string `binary` is assigned the reverse of the string `s`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `table` contains mappings for specific characters to integer values for all characters in `input`, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `c` is the next character in `input`, `s` is the binary formatted value of the next character, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, and the result of `print(prev - integer) % 256` is displayed.
