Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is with the line `print(prev - integer) % 256`. This line should be enclosed in parentheses to calculate the modulo operation first before printing. Additionally, the description states that the initial result of the first step should be considered 0, but this is not reflected in the code. Based on the description, the code should first print 0 as the result of processing the first element.
