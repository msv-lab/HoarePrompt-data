Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the steps described in the problem description. The calculation of the integer to be printed is missing the reversal of the ASCII code, subtraction of the i-th element modulo 256, and the final reversal to produce the ASCII code. The program only prints the subtraction result without following the correct process. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not produce the initial array as described in the problem.
