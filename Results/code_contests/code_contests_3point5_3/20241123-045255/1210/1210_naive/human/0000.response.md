Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all the potential cases as described in the problem statement. For example, if the input is "31 of month", the program will output 8 instead of the expected 11. Additionally, the code is not very readable and lacks clarity in terms of understanding the logic behind the calculation. This indicates that the program is incorrect.
