Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016 based on the input. 

For example, if the input is "1 of week", the program will output 52, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, Limak will save one candy on the 1st day of the week (Monday), not all Mondays. 

Therefore, the program logic does not match the requirements of the problem description, making it incorrect.
