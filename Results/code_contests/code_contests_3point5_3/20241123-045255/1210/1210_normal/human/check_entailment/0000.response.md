Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not correctly calculate the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016 based on the input format. The code seems to have issues with the logic and calculations involved, especially with the division operation and conditional statements. The output hints also point out potential issues with missing closing parentheses and the possibility of zero division errors. 

Therefore, based on the mismatch between the code and the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed false.
