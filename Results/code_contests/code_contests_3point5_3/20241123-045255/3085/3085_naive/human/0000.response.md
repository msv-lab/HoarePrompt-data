Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it calculates the permutation `p` that maximizes `b` lexicographically without increasing the total number of inversions.
2. The program correctly handles all possible values of `n` and `k` within the specified constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k ≤ n < 2k; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).
3. It constructs the sequence `a` according to the given formula and then calculates the total number of inversions in `a` using the `func_8` function.
4. It then iterates over different values of `i` to find the permutation `p` that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description and returns the correct permutation for each test case.
5. The program is well-structured and follows the logic described in the problem statement.
