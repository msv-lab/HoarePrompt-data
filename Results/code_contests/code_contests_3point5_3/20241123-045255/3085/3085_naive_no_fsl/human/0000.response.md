Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines functions to read input, calculate inversion count, and find the permutation p that maximizes b lexicographically without increasing the total number of inversions.
2. It handles multiple test cases and prints the output for each test case.
3. The program uses a BIT (Binary Indexed Tree) data structure to efficiently calculate the inversion count.
4. The logic to generate the permutation p is based on the problem description and ensures that the total number of inversions in b doesn't exceed the total number of inversions in a, and b is lexicographically maximum.
5. The program runs as expected for the given problem description and handles the constraints provided.
