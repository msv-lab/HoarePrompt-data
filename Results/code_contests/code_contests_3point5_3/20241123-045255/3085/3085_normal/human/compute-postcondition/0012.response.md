Example Answer:
`a[k]` is assigned the value `k`, where `k` is a valid value. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, `a[k]` is assigned `k`.
Output State: **`2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, `a[k]` is assigned `k`**
