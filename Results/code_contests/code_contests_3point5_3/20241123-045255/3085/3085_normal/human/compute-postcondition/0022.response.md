According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If the condition `2 * k - n` is less than `k + 1` holds true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `2 * k - n` is less than `k + 1`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, `a[k]` is assigned `k`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1, and the state of `2 * k - n` needs to be re-evaluated based on the updated `k`.
State: **`2 * (k + 1) - n` is less than `k + 1`, `k` is a valid value + 1, `a[k]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `k + 1`, `a[k + 1]` is assigned `k + 1`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`**
