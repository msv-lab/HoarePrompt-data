According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `2 * (k + 1) - n` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `2 * (k + 1) - n` is less than `k + 1`, `k` is a valid value + 1, `a[k]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 1]` is equal to `i`, `a[k + 1]` is assigned `k + 1`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 * (k + 2) - n` should be less than `k + 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`2 * (k + 2) - n` is less than `k + 2`, `k` is a valid value + 2, `a[k]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 1]` is equal to `i`, `a[k + 1]` is assigned `k + 1`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`**
