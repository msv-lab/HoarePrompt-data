Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where k â‰¤ n < 2k. If `n` is equal to `k`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program variables. Ensure that the precondition constraints are maintained throughout the execution of the program.***
