Example Answer:
`a[k - 1]` is assigned the value `i`, and `k` is a valid value + 1. Therefore, after execution, `a[k - 1]` will be equal to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `2 * (k + 1) - n` is less than `k + 1`, `k` is a valid value + 1, `a[k]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 1]` is equal to `i`, `a[k + 1]` is assigned `k + 1`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`.
Output State: **`2 * (k + 1) - n` is less than `k + 1`, `k` is a valid value + 1, `a[k]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 1]` is equal to `i`, `a[k + 1]` is assigned `k + 1`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`**
