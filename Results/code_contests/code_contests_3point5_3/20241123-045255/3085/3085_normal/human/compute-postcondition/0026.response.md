The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It operates with predefined variables within the function. The function ensures that the precondition constraints are maintained throughout its execution.

Case_1: If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program variables.

Case_2: If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive. If `n` equals `k + 1`, the function returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive followed by the values `k` and `k-1`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program variables.

Case_3: 
- If `2 * k - n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will not execute.
- If the loop executes, specific assignments are made to variables in the program.
- `curInv` will be assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`.
- If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function will return a list `ans` containing the range from 1 to `k`, with specific values at positions `k - 1` and `i - 1`.
- If the loop does not execute, there will be no change in the state of the program.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It ensures that the precondition constraints are maintained throughout its execution. Depending on the conditions specified in the cases, it may return a range of values or modify the state of program variables accordingly.**
