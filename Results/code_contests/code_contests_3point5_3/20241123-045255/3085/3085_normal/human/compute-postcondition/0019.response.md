Postcondition: ***`2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, `a[k]` is assigned `k`, and `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function returns a list `ans` containing the range from 1 to `k`, where the values at positions `k - 1` and `i - 1` are `i` and `k` respectively. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
