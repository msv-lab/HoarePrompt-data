Output State: 
- If `2 * k - n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will not execute.
- If the loop executes, `a[k - 1]` will be assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` will be assigned the value of `k`, and `a[k]` will be assigned the value of `k`.
- `curInv` will be assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`.
- If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function will return a list `ans` containing the range from 1 to `k`, with the values at positions `k - 1` and `i - 1` as `i` and `k` respectively.
- If the loop does not execute, there will be no change in the state of the program.
