You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **n and k are positive integers such that k ≤ n < 2k, and the total sum of k over test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**
```
def func_9():
```
Output: Case_1: *`n` and `k` are positive integers where k ≤ n < 2k. If `n` is equal to `k`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program variables. Ensure that the precondition constraints are maintained throughout the execution of the program.

Case_2: *`n` and `k` are positive integers where k ≤ n < 2k. If `n` is equal to `k`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive. If `n` equals `k + 1`, the program returns a range from 1 to k inclusive followed by the values k and k-1. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program variables.

Case_3: Output State: 
- If `2 * k - n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will not execute.
- If the loop executes, `a[k - 1]` will be assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` will be assigned the value of `k`, and `a[k]` will be assigned the value of `k`.
- `curInv` will be assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`.
- If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function will return a list `ans` containing the range from 1 to `k`, with the values at positions `k - 1` and `i - 1` as `i` and `k` respectively.
- If the loop does not execute, there will be no change in the state of the program.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
