Example Answer:
The function `func_8` is called with parameters `a` and `n`, and the return value is assigned to `maxInv`. The output state will depend on the specific implementation of `func_8` and the initial values of `a` and `n`, which are not provided. Therefore, the output state will vary based on the specific values of `a` and `n`.
Output State: **Output state will vary based on the conditions mentioned above**
