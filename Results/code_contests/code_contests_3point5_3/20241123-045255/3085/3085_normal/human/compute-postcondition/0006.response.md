Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where k â‰¤ n < 2k. If `n` is equal to `k`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive. If `n` equals `k + 1`, the program returns a range from 1 to k inclusive followed by the values k and k-1. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program variables.***
