Example Answer:
The value of `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, and `k` is a valid value. The relationship between `2 * k - n` and `k` is not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`.
Output State: **`2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`**
