Example Answer: 
The function `func_2()` returns two positive integers n and k, where k is less than or equal to n and n is less than 2k. Given the constraints, the returned values of n and k satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that k ≤ n < 2k.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that k ≤ n < 2k**
