Example Answer:
The value of `i` is assigned to the `(k-1)` index of list `a`. Since `k` is a valid value, the index `k-1` is within the bounds of the list. The calculation `2 * k - n < k` does not affect the variables directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`.
Output State: **`2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`**
