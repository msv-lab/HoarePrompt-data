Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned to `ans[k - 1]`, which means the value of `i` is placed in the (k-1)th index of `ans`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, `a[k]` is assigned `k`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is a range from 1 to `k`, and `i` is assigned to `ans[k - 1]`.
Output State: **`2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, `a[k]` is assigned `k`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is a range from 1 to `k`, and `i` is assigned to `ans[k - 1]**
