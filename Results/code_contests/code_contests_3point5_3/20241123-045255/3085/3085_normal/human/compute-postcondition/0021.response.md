Example Answer: 
The value of `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, but the previous values of `k`, `a` and `curInv` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `2 * k - n` is less than `k + 1`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, `a[k]` is assigned `k`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n`.
Output State: **`2 * k - n` is less than `k + 1`, `k` is a valid value, `a[k - 1]` is assigned `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`, `a[k]` is assigned `k`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`**
