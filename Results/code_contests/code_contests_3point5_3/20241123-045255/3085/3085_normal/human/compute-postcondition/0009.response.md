According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. The loop will execute if the value of `k` is such that `2 * k - n` is less than `k`. Before the loop starts, there is no information provided about the variables. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that `2 * k - n` is less than `k` and `k` is a valid value that satisfies the condition.
State: **`2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `k` is a valid value**
