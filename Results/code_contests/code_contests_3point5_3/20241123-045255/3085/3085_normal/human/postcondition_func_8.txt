The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It ensures that `n` and `k` are positive integers where `k` â‰¤ `n` < 2`k`. 
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive.
- If `n` equals `k + 1`, the function returns a range from 1 to `k` inclusive followed by the values `k` and `k-1`.
- In the loop, if `2 * k - n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, it assigns values to elements in a list `a`, calculates `curInv`, and if `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, it returns a modified list `ans`.
