The function `func_6` takes two parameters: `BITree`, which is a Binary Indexed Tree data structure, and `index`, a non-negative integer representing an index in the BITree. It calculates the sum of values at updated indices in BITree based on the value of `index`. If `index` is greater than 0, the function returns the sum of values at these updated indices. If `index` is 0 or negative, the function returns the initial sum value. The function does not handle cases where `index` is negative, potentially leading to unexpected results.
