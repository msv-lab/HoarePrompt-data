The function `func_3` reads an input string, converts it to a list, and then returns a new list containing all elements of the original list except for the last element. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it relies on the input() function to read user input. It should be noted that the function does not have any error handling for cases where the input is empty or not a list, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
