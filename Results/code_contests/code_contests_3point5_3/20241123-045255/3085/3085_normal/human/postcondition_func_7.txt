The function func_8 accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`. It calculates the inversion count in the array `arr` using the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) data structure by iterating through the array in reverse order. The inversion count is then returned. If `n` is 0 or if the maximum element in `arr` is less than 1, the function will not execute the calculation.
