The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `n`, a positive integer representing the length of `arr`. The function initializes a BIT list with zeros, updates the elements of BIT based on the results of func_6 and func_7, and calculates the final value of 'invcount' after all iterations. The program returns this final value of 'invcount' as the output. If the input `n` is less than 1, the loop iterations will not occur, and 'invcount' will remain 0.
