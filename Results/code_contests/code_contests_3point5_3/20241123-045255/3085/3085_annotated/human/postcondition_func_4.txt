The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` as a parameter. It prints the elements of the list `l` where each element is a tuple containing two positive integers `n` and `k`. The function does not explicitly return anything but outputs the elements of the list `l` as a string with spaces separating the integers of each tuple.
