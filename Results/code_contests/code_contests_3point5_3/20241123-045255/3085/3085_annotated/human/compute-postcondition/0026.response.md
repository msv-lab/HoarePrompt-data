The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. 

Case 1: The function checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, it returns a range from 1 to k+1. In all other cases where n is not equal to k, the function returns None.

Case 2: The function checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, it returns a range from 1 to k+1; otherwise, it returns None. This case also highlights the need for a revised postcondition to cover all possible scenarios based on the defined constraints and edge cases.

Case 3: The function does not have an explicit return value in this case. It describes the state of variables after the loop executes, detailing the values of `i`, `k`, `a[k-1]`, `a[k-2]`, `a[k]`, `curInv`, and 'ans' based on different conditions of `n` compared to `k`. It also explains the actions taken by the function in updating the 'ans' list in certain scenarios.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to handle different cases based on the relationship between `n` and `k`, returning a range of values or None accordingly. Additionally, it describes the state of variables after the loop executes in Case 3.
