You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **n and k are integers such that k ≤ n < 2k, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.**
```
def func_9():
```
Output: Case_1: *`n` and `k` are valid integers satisfying the conditions k ≤ n < 2k, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5. If n is equal to k, then the function returns a range from 1 to k+1. In all other cases where n is not equal to k, the function returns None.

Case_2: *`n` and `k` are valid integers satisfying the conditions k ≤ n < 2k, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5. If n is equal to k, the function returns a range from 1 to k+1; otherwise, the function returns None. In the given program fragment, the if condition checks if n is equal to k + 1, in which case it returns a range from 1 to k-1. However, this logic does not cover all cases, such as when n equals k or falls outside the specified range. Therefore, the postcondition should be revised to include all possible scenarios based on the defined constraints and edge cases.

Case_3: Output State: 
If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will not execute. If `n` is less than `k`, the loop will execute at least once. 
After the loop executes:
- If the loop executes at least once: 
  - `i`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`.
  - `a[k - 1]` is equal to the value of `i` in the last iteration of the loop.
  - `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function assigns the range of values from 1 to `k` to the list 'ans'. It then updates the `k-th` and `i-th` elements of 'ans' with `i` and `k` respectively before returning 'ans'.
- If the loop does not execute: 
  - `i`, `k`, `a[k - 1]`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` remain unchanged.
  - `curInv`, `ans` are not modified.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
