Example Answer:
`a[k - 2]` is assigned the value of `k`. The value of `k` is not given in the initial state, so the exact value cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is assigned to `a[k - 1] and `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`.
Output State: **`i` is assigned to `a[k - 1]` and `a[k - 2]` is assigned `k`**
