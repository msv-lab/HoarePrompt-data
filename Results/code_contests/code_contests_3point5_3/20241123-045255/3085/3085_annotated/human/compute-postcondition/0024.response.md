According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is `k`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1**.
