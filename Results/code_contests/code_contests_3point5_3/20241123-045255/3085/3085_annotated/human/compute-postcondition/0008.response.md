Example Answer:
The function `func_8` takes two parameters `a` and `n`, where `n` is the given integer. If `n` is equal to `k`, then the function returns a range from 1 to `k+1`. Otherwise, it returns None. Given that `n` and `k` are valid integers satisfying the conditions `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`, the output state after executing the code is not determinable without the actual values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **Not determinable without specific values of `n` and `k`**
