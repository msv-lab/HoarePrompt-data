Example Answer:
`a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is equal to `k - 1`. Since `i` is `k - 1`, the value assigned to `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `k - 1`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`.
Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`**
