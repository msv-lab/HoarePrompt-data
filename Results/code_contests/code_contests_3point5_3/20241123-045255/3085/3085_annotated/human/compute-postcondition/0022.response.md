According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`. `a[k - 1]` is equal to `k`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 1`.
State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`, `a[k - 1]` is equal to `k`**
