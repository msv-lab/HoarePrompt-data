Example Answer:
The function `func_8` is called with arguments `a` and `n`. The initial state shows that `i` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`. The function `func_8` will manipulate the values of `a` and `n` internally, but the values of `i`, `a[k - 2]`, and `a[k]` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`.
Output State: **`i` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`**
