Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by the function `func_2()`. The function is assumed to return valid values based on the preconditions provided. Since the function is not described, we can assume that the values returned are valid integers satisfying the conditions k ≤ n < 2k, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are valid integers satisfying the conditions k ≤ n < 2k, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are valid integers satisfying the conditions k ≤ n < 2k, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5**
