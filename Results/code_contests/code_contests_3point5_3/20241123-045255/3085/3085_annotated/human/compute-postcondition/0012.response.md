Example Answer:
`a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`, which is the same as `k`. The value of `k` was assigned to `a[k - 2]`, so `a[k - 2]` is now `k`. `i` was assigned to `a[k - 1]`, which means `i` is now equal to `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`.
Output State: **`i` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`**
