Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are valid integers satisfying the conditions k ≤ n < 2k, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5. If n is equal to k, the function returns a range from 1 to k+1; otherwise, the function returns None. In the given program fragment, the if condition checks if n is equal to k + 1, in which case it returns a range from 1 to k-1. However, this logic does not cover all cases, such as when n equals k or falls outside the specified range. Therefore, the postcondition should be revised to include all possible scenarios based on the defined constraints and edge cases.***
