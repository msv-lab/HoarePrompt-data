Postcondition: ***`i`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function assigns the range of values from 1 to `k` to the list 'ans'. It then updates the `k-th` and `i-th` elements of 'ans' with `i` and `k` respectively before returning 'ans'. No other changes occur to the variables.***
