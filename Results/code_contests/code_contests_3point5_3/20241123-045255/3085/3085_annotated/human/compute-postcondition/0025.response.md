Output State: 
If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will not execute. If `n` is less than `k`, the loop will execute at least once. 
After the loop executes:
- If the loop executes at least once: 
  - `i`, `k`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` are all equal to `k`.
  - `a[k - 1]` is equal to the value of `i` in the last iteration of the loop.
  - `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function assigns the range of values from 1 to `k` to the list 'ans'. It then updates the `k-th` and `i-th` elements of 'ans' with `i` and `k` respectively before returning 'ans'.
- If the loop does not execute: 
  - `i`, `k`, `a[k - 1]`, `a[k - 2]`, `a[k]` remain unchanged.
  - `curInv`, `ans` are not modified.
