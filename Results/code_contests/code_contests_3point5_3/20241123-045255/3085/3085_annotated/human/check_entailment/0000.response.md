Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For example, when n is equal to k + 1, the logic in function 9 is incorrect. The program should return a permutation p that maximizes b lexicographically without increasing the total number of inversions for every test case. However, due to the incorrect logic in function 9, the program fails to provide the correct output for the mentioned case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
