The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. 
It checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, it returns a range from 1 to k+1. In all other cases where n is not equal to k, the function returns None.
Additionally, it handles different cases based on the relationship between `n` and `k`, detailing the state of variables after the loop executes, but the logic of updating the 'ans' list is incomplete and does not cover all scenarios, especially when n equals k or falls outside the specified range. Thus, the postcondition should be revised to include all possible scenarios based on the defined constraints and edge cases.
