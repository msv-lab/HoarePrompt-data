Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point based on the given weather forecast. It considers all possible scenarios and handles the periodic nature of the forecast string. The logic of updating the ship's coordinates based on the wind direction and calculating the minimum distance to the destination point is implemented correctly. The program covers all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.
