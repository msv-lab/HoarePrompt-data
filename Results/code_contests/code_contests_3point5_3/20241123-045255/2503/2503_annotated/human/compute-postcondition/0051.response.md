According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_dist`, `n`, `i`, `u`, `r` remain unchanged, `pref_sums[i]` is updated, `new_x` and `new_y` are calculated, and `dist` is updated. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `min_dist`, `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `u`, `r`, `pref_sums[i]` is updated, `new_x` and `new_y` are recalculated, `dist` is updated with the absolute differences between `new_x` and `x2`, between `new_y` and `y2`, subtracting `i`, and subtracting `1`.**
