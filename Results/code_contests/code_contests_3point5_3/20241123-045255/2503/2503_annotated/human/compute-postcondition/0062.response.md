Example Answer: 
The value of `cycles` is calculated based on the given formula using the values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `min_dist`, and `moves_toward`. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, `cycles` is calculated as specified. No changes are made to the other variables.
Output State: **`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, `cycles` is calculated using the provided formula**.
