According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n + 1`. All other states remain the same since they are incremented or updated within the loop.
State: **`min_dist`, `n`, `i` are all incremented by 1, `pref_sums[i]` is updated, `new_x` and `new_y` are recalculated, `dist` is updated with absolute differences and subtracting `i` and subtracting `1`, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is less than `n + 1`**
