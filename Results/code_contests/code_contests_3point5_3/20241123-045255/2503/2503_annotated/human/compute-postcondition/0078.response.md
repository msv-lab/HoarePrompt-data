According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition where `dist` is less than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `res` needs to be recalculated based on the updated `n` and `cycles`.
- `x1` needs to be updated based on the new value of `cycles` and `pref_sums[-1][0]`.
- `y1` needs to be updated based on the new value of `cycles` and `pref_sums[-1][1]`.
- The absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` needs to be recalculated.
- `new_x` needs to be updated based on the new value of `pref_sums[i+1][0]`.
- `new_y` needs to be updated based on the new value of `pref_sums[i+1][1]`.
- `dist` needs to be recalculated based on the updated values of `new_x`, `new_y`, `x2`, `y2`, `i+1`, `n`, and `cycles`.

State: **`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `res` is recalculated based on updated `n` and `cycles`, `x1` is updated based on new `cycles` and `pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated based on new `cycles` and `pref_sums[-1][1]`, absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is greater than 0, `new_x` is updated based on new `pref_sums[i+1][0]`, `new_y` is updated based on new `pref_sums[i+1][1]`, `dist` is recalculated, if dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the value of res + i + 1**
