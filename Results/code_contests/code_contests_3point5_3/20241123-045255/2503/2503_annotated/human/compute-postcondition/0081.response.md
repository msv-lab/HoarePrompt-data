Output State: **If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and -1 is printed. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`, `x1` is updated based on the final values of `cycles` and `pref_sums`, `y1` is updated based on the final values of `cycles` and `pref_sums`, the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is determined. If this difference is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the value of `res` plus `i` plus 1.**
