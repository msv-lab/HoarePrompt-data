Postcondition: ***`min_dist`, `dist`, `n`, `i`, `u`, `r` are integers. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'L', `min_dist`, `dist`, `n`, `i`, `u`, `r` remain unchanged. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not 'L', `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `u` is -1, and `r` is 0.***
