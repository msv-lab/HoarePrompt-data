Example Answer: 
A 2D list `pref_sums` is created with dimensions based on the value of `n`. Each element in the list is initially `[0, 0]`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. The output state is: `x1` and `y1` have values based on the input provided, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values based on the input provided, and `pref_sums` is a 2D list of zeros based on the value of `n`.
Output State: **`x1` and `y1` have values based on the input provided, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values based on the input provided, and `pref_sums` is a 2D list of zeros based on the value of `n`**
