According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `res` is recalculated based on updated `n` and `cycles`, `x1` is updated based on new `cycles` and `pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated based on new `cycles` and `pref_sums[-1][1]`, absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is greater than 0, `new_x` is updated based on new `pref_sums[i+1][0]`, `new_y` is updated based on new `pref_sums[i+1][1]`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`.
