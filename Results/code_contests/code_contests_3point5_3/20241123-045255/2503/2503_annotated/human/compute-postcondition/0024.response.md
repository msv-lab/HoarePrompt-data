Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r` are all assigned values based on the input provided. If the first element of list `s` is 'D', then `u` is assigned -1, `r` is assigned 1. If the first element of list `s` is 'U', then `u` is assigned 1, and `r` is assigned 0. If the first element of list `s` is 'R', then `u` is assigned 1, and `r` is assigned 1. If the first element of list `s` is 'L', then `u` is assigned 0, `r` is assigned -1. After the if statement, if the first element of list `s` is 'L', then `r` is assigned -1. `pref_sums[0]` is assigned the list `[r, u]` which holds the values of `r` and `u`. 
After executing the code `new_x, new_y = x1 + r, y1 + u`, `new_x` is assigned the value of `x1 + r` and `new_y` is assigned the value of `y1 + u`.
`dist` is calculated as the Manhattan distance between the new position `(new_x, new_y)` and the target position `(x2, y2)`, minus 1.**
