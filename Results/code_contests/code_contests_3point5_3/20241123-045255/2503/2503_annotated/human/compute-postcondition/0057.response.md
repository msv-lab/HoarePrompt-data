Example Answer:
The code calculates the difference in movements `moves_toward` based on the coordinates of two points and the updated coordinates after `n` iterations. The minimum distance `min_dist` is updated based on the calculated `moves_toward` value. The other variables are not affected by this calculation. Edge cases are considered to ensure non-negative distances. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, other variables remain unchanged**
