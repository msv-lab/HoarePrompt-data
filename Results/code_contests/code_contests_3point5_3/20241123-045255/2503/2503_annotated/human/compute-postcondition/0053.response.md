According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_dist`, `n`, and `i` are all incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the updated `n`. Additionally, `u` and `r` are both 0, `pref_sums[i]` is updated, `new_x` and `new_y` are recalculated, `dist` is updated with absolute differences, and subtracting `i` and subtracting 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
State: **`min_dist`, `n`, `i`, `u`, `r` are all incremented by 1, `pref_sums[i]` is updated, `new_x` and `new_y` are recalculated, `dist` is updated with absolute differences, and subtracting `i` and subtracting `1`**
