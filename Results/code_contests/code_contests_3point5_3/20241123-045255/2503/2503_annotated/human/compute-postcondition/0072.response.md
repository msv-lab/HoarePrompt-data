Postcondition: ***min_dist contains the minimum distance calculated, moves_toward is greater than 0, res is calculated as n * cycles, x1 is updated to x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0], y1 is updated to y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1], the absolute difference between x1 and x2 plus the absolute difference between y1 and y2 minus n * cycles is greater than 0, new_x is updated to x1 + pref_sums[i][0], new_y is updated to y1 + pref_sums[i][1], dist is calculated as the absolute difference between new_x and x2 plus the absolute difference between new_y and y2 minus i minus n * cycles minus 1, and dist is less than or equal to 0***
