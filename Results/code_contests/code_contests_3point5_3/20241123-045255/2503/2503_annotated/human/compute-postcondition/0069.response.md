According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is greater than 0.**
