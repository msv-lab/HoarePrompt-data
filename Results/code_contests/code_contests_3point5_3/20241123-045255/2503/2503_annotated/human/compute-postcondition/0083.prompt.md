You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 are non-negative integers such that (x_1, y_1) != (x_2, y_2). n is a positive integer. s is a string of length n consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R.**
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *x1 and y1 have values based on the input provided, x2 and y2 are assigned values based on the input provided. If x1 is equal to x2 and y1 is equal to y2, the program prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of x1, y1, x2, and y2.

Case_2: *After the execution of the code, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r` are all assigned values based on the input. If the first element of list `s` is 'D', then `u` is assigned -1, `r` is assigned 1. If the first element of list `s` is 'U', then `u` is assigned 1, and `r` is assigned 0. If the first element of list `s` is 'R', then `u` is assigned 1, and `r` is assigned 1. If the first element of list `s` is 'L', then `u` is assigned 0, `r` is assigned -1. After the if statement, if the first element of list `s` is 'L', then `r` is assigned -1. `pref_sums[0]` is assigned the list `[r, u]` which holds the values of `r` and `u`. After executing the code, `new_x` is assigned the value of `x1 + r` and `new_y` is assigned the value of `y1 + u`. `dist` is calculated as the Manhattan distance between the new position `(new_x, new_y)` and the target position `(x2, y2)`, minus 1. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1.

Case_3: The loop calculates the minimum distance `min_dist` between two points based on the given conditions. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `min_dist` will contain the minimum distance calculated throughout the iterations. Variables `u` and `r` control the direction of movement. `pref_sums[i]` stores the cumulative sums of movements. `new_x` and `new_y` represent the updated coordinates. Edge cases are considered in the calculation of `dist`, ensuring it is non-negative.

Case_4: *`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

Case_5: *`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, -1 is printed, and the program exits. Otherwise, `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`. `x1, y1` are updated based on the previous values, where `x1, y1` are now equal to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0], y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`. If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, then the function prints `res` and returns. The overall state of the program after the if-else block is determined by the conditions mentioned, ensuring the proper handling of all possible edge cases.

Case_6: If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and -1 is printed. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`, `x1` is updated based on the final values of `cycles` and `pref_sums`, `y1` is updated based on the final values of `cycles` and `pref_sums`, the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is determined. If this difference is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the value of `res` plus `i` plus 1.

Case_7: -1

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
