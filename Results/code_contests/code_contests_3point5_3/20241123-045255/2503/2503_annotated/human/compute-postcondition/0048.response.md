Output State: **`min_dist`, `n`, `i`, `u`, `r` remain unchanged. `pref_sums[i]` is updated with values `[pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u]`. `new_x` is assigned the value `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`. `new_y` is assigned the value `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. `dist` is updated with the calculated absolute difference between `new_x` and `x2`, absolute difference between `new_y` and `y2`, subtracting `i`, and subtracting `1`. The code snippet prints the value of `i + 1`.**
