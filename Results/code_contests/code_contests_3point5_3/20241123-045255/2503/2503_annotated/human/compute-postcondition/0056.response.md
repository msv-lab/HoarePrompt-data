Output State: **The loop calculates the minimum distance `min_dist` between two points based on the given conditions. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `min_dist` will contain the minimum distance calculated throughout the iterations. Variables `u` and `r` control the direction of movement. `pref_sums[i]` stores the cumulative sums of movements. `new_x` and `new_y` represent the updated coordinates. Edge cases are considered in the calculation of `dist`, ensuring it is non-negative.**
