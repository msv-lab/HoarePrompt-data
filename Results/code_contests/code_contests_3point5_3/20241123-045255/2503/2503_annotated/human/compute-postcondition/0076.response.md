According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is greater than 0, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, `dist` is calculated as the absolute difference between `new_x` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `new_y` and `y2` minus `i` minus `n * cycles` minus 1. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the value of res + i + 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following variables need to be updated:
- `new_x` should be updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i+1][0]`
- `new_y` should be updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i+1][1]`
- `dist` calculation should be adjusted accordingly based on the updated `new_x` and `new_y`
- `i` should be incremented by 1
- `res` should be updated to `n * cycles`
- Any other intermediate variables used within the loop body should be updated accordingly based on the new values of `i`, `new_x`, and `new_y`.

State: **`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is greater than 0, `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i+1][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i+1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as the absolute difference between `new_x` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `new_y` and `y2` minus `i+1` minus `n * cycles` minus 1. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the value of res + i + 1.**
