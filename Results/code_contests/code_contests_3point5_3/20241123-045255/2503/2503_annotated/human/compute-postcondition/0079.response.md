Output State: **`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is greater than 0, `res` is recalculated based on updated `n` and `cycles`, `x1` is updated based on new `cycles` and `pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated based on new `cycles` and `pref_sums[-1][1`, absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is greater than 0, `new_x` is updated based on new `pref_sums[i+1][0]`, `new_y` is updated based on new `pref_sums[i+1][1]`.**
