Postcondition: ***`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, -1 is printed, and the program exits. Otherwise, `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`. `x1, y1` are updated based on the previous values, where `x1, y1` are now equal to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0], y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`. If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, then the function prints `res` and returns. The overall state of the program after the if-else block is determined by the conditions mentioned, ensuring the proper handling of all possible edge cases.***
