According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist` which does not guarantee that the loop will execute. To ensure that the loop will execute, `n` needs to be greater than 1 and `i` should be 1.
State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
