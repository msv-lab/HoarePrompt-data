Example Answer:
The new values of `x1` and `y1` are calculated based on the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `cycles`, and `pref_sums[-1]`. After the calculation, the output state will be dependent on the new values of `x1` and `y1`.
Output State: **`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, if `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, -1 is printed and the program exits, otherwise `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`; `x1, y1` are updated based on the previous values, where `x1, y1` are now equal to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0], y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`**
