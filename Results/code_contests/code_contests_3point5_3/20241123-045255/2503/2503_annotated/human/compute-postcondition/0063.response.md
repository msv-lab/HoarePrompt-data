Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value `n * cycles`, where `n` and `cycles` are unknown. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, `cycles` is calculated using the provided formula. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, `moves_toward` is checked and if less than or equal to 0, -1 is printed and the program exits, otherwise `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`.
Output State: **`min_dist` contains the minimum distance calculated, if `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, -1 is printed and the program exits, otherwise `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`**
