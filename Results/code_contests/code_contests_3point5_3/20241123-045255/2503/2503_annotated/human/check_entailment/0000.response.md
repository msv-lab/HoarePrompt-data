Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point based on the given initial coordinates, destination point coordinates, and wind forecast. It considers all possible movements of the ship according to the wind direction and handles edge cases such as reaching the destination in 1 day, being impossible to reach the destination, and calculating the minimum distance efficiently. The logic provided in the code aligns with the problem description, and no potential case has been identified where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
