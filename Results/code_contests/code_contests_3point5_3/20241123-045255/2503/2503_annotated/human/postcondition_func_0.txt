The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` and calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. It achieves this by iteratively swapping and recalculating `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. Once the loop finishes, the function returns the greatest common divisor of the initial `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, the function returns the value of `x` itself.
