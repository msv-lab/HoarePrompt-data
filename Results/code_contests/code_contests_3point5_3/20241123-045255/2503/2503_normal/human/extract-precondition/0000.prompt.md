You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You a captain of a ship. Initially you are standing in a point (x_1, y_1) (obviously, all positions in the sea can be described by cartesian plane) and you want to travel to a point (x_2, y_2). 

You know the weather forecast — the string s of length n, consisting only of letters U, D, L and R. The letter corresponds to a direction of wind. Moreover, the forecast is periodic, e.g. the first day wind blows to the side s_1, the second day — s_2, the n-th day — s_n and (n+1)-th day — s_1 again and so on. 

Ship coordinates change the following way:

  * if wind blows the direction U, then the ship moves from (x, y) to (x, y + 1); 
  * if wind blows the direction D, then the ship moves from (x, y) to (x, y - 1); 
  * if wind blows the direction L, then the ship moves from (x, y) to (x - 1, y); 
  * if wind blows the direction R, then the ship moves from (x, y) to (x + 1, y). 



The ship can also either go one of the four directions or stay in place each day. If it goes then it's exactly 1 unit of distance. Transpositions of the ship and the wind add up. If the ship stays in place, then only the direction of wind counts. For example, if wind blows the direction U and the ship moves the direction L, then from point (x, y) it will move to the point (x - 1, y + 1), and if it goes the direction U, then it will move to the point (x, y + 2).

You task is to determine the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point (x_2, y_2).

Input

The first line contains two integers x_1, y_1 (0 ≤ x_1, y_1 ≤ 10^9) — the initial coordinates of the ship.

The second line contains two integers x_2, y_2 (0 ≤ x_2, y_2 ≤ 10^9) — the coordinates of the destination point.

It is guaranteed that the initial coordinates and destination point coordinates are different.

The third line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the string s.

The fourth line contains the string s itself, consisting only of letters U, D, L and R.

Output

The only line should contain the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point (x_2, y_2).

If it's impossible then print "-1".

Note

In the first example the ship should perform the following sequence of moves: "RRRRU". Then its coordinates will change accordingly: (0, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 3) → (4, 4) → (4, 6).

In the second example the ship should perform the following sequence of moves: "DD" (the third day it should stay in place). Then its coordinates will change accordingly: (0, 3) → (0, 3) → (0, 1) → (0, 0).

In the third example the ship can never reach the point (0, 1).
