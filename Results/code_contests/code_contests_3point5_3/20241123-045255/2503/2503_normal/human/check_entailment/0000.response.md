Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_2` reads the input values and processes the movement of the ship based on the wind directions provided in the forecast string `s`. It calculates the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point `(x2, y2)`.
- The code handles cases where the ship needs to move in various directions based on the wind forecast. It updates the ship's position according to the rules mentioned in the problem description.
- The code considers different scenarios such as staying in place, moving towards the destination, and handling periodic wind forecasts correctly.
- The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description, and there are no evident cases where the program does not follow the specified requirements.
- Additionally, the output hints provide a detailed explanation of the code's behavior, which confirms that the code correctly determines the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code, description, and output hints, the correctness of the program is **True**.
