Example Answer:
The values of `x1` and `y1` are assigned by mapping the input to integers. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space. Since the initial state is not provided, the final output state after this code snippet cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **Uncertain state of `x1` and `y1` after input mapping**
