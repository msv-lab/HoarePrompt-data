Postcondition: ***`dist`, `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, `y2`, `i`, `n`, `cycles`, `res` are all integers. The absolute value of the difference between `new_x` and `x2` plus the absolute value of the difference between `new_y` and `y2` minus `i` minus `n` multiplied by `cycles` minus 1 is stored in `dist`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the value of `res + i + 1`.***
