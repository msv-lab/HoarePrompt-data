Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r` are integers. `pref_sums` is a list of lists where each sublist is [0, 0] and the list has a length of `n`. If `s[i]` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1. If `s[i]` is 'R', then `u` remains unchanged, `r` is assigned the value 1. If `s[i]` is 'L', then `u` remains unchanged, `r` retains its initial value 1. All other variables retain their initial values.***
