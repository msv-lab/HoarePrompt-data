According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `dist`, `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, `y2`, `i+1`, `n`, `cycles`, `res` are all integers. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n` so it needs to be adjusted to `i+1`, and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dist`, `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, `y2`, `i+1`, `n`, `cycles`, `res` are all integers**
