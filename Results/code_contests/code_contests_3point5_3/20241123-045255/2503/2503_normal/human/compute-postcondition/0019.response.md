Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r` are integers. `pref_sums` is a list of lists where each sublist is [0, 0] and the list has a length of `n`. `u` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition s[0] == 'U'. If the first element of s is 'U', `u` is set to -1; otherwise, all variables retain their initial values or conditions. If the first element of s is 'R', `r` is assigned the value 1. In all cases, `r` remains 0 if the condition is not met. The first element of s is 'L'***
