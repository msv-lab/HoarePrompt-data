Output State: **The program prints -1 and returns if `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0; otherwise, `res` is calculated as the product of `n` and `cycles`. After executing the code snippet, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]` and `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`. The absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n` times `cycles` is less than or equal to 0.**
