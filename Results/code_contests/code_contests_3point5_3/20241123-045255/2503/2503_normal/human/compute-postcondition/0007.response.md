Example Answer: 
The program takes an input and assigns it to variable `s`. The states of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` do not change based on the provided code. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` and `y1`, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`x1` and `y1`, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer**
