Example Answer: 
`x2` and `y2` are assigned the integer values obtained from mapping the input after splitting. The initial state of `x1` and `y1` is uncertain as they are not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: Uncertain state of `x1` and `y1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned integer values obtained from input mapping.
Output State: **Uncertain state of `x1` and `y1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned integer values obtained from input mapping**
