Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r` are integers. `pref_sums` is a list of lists where each sublist is [0, 0] and the list has a length of `n`. If the first element of s is 'U', `u` is set to -1; if the first element of s is 'R', `r` is assigned the value 1; if the first element of s is 'L', `r` is assigned the value -1. In all other cases, `r` remains 0. `new_x` is the sum of `x1` and `r`, and `new_y` is the sum of `y1` and `u`.**
