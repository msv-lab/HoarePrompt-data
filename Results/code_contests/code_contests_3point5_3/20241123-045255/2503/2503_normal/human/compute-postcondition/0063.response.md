Example Answer:
The value of `res` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `cycles`. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program will print -1 and return. The state of other variables is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **The program prints -1 and returns if `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0; otherwise, `res` is calculated as the product of `n` and `cycles`.**
