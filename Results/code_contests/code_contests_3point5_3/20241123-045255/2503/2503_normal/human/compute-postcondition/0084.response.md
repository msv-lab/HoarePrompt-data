Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input values and operates based on conditions defined within the code. It handles cases where specific conditions are met to print certain values or terminate the program. The function does not accept explicit parameters but performs actions based on the internal logic implemented for different scenarios. The code may not fully align with the annotations provided, so it's essential to focus on the actual operations performed within each case to understand the function's behavior accurately.**
