According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, the values of all variables are given, but some need adjustments for the loop to execute. Since the loop starts from 1, `i` should be assigned the value 1 at the start. Additionally, since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to n-1, `i` should be less than `n` at the start. Therefore, the adjusted states are:
State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, `min_dist` are integers, `pref_sums` is a list of lists where each sublist is [0, 0] and the list has a length of `n`, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2**
