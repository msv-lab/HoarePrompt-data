Postcondition: ***If abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, res is calculated as the product of n and cycles. After the execution, x1 is updated to x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0] and y1 is updated to y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]. The postcondition covers all cases where the condition is met and when it is not met, ensuring the proper updating of variables x1 and y1 based on the given calculations.***
