You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 are non-negative integers such that (x_1, y_1) != (x_2, y_2). n is a positive integer. s is a string of length n consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R.**
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`x1` and `y1`, `x2` and `y2` are integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, then the program prints 0 and returns. In all other cases, the program does nothing.

Case_2: *`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are integers. `pref_sums` is a list of lists where each sublist is [0, 0] and the list has a length of `n`. If the first element of s is 'U', `u` is set to -1; if the first element of s is 'R', `r` is assigned the value 1; if the first element of s is 'L', `r` is assigned the value -1. In all other cases, `r` remains 0. `new_x` is the sum of `x1` and `r`, and `new_y` is the sum of `y1` and `u`. `dist` is the absolute difference between `new_x` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `new_y` and `y2` minus 1. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1 and terminates.

Case_3: Output State: 
- If the first element of `s` is not 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L', the loop won't execute and the initial state remains unchanged.
- After each iteration of the loop, `u` and `r` are updated based on the values in `s[i]`, and `pref_sums[i]` is updated according to the given formula.
- `new_x` is calculated as the sum of `x1` and the first element of `pref_sums[i]`, and `new_y` is calculated as the sum of `y1` and the second element of `pref_sums[i]`.
- The variable `dist` is computed based on the absolute differences between `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, and `y2` along with `i`.
- If `dist` is less than or equal to 0 during any iteration, the program prints `i + 1` and terminates.
- `min_dist` is updated if `dist` is less than the current `min_dist`.

This loop updates the values of `u`, `r`, `pref_sums`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` while iterating through the elements of `s`. If the conditions for `dist` are met, the loop may terminate early.

Case_4: *The initial state remains unchanged as the first element of `s` is not 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L'. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and returns. No modifications are made to the initial state of `s` in any case.

Case_5: *If abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, res is calculated as the product of n and cycles. After the execution, x1 is updated to x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0] and y1 is updated to y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]. The postcondition covers all cases where the condition is met and when it is not met, ensuring the proper updating of variables x1 and y1 based on the given calculations.

Case_6: `dist`, `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, `y2`, `i+1`, `n`, `cycles`, `res` are all integers. The absolute value of the difference between `new_x` and `x2` plus the absolute value of the difference between `new_y` and `y2` minus `i+1` minus `n` multiplied by `cycles` minus 1 is stored in `dist`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the value of `res + i + 1`. If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and the program prints -1 and returns.

Case_7: The program prints the value of res + i + 1 if dist is less than or equal to 0. If n is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and returns

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
