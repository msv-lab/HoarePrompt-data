According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`, as well as the condition involving `dist`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are integers. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `dist` needs to be greater than 0
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1
- No other states need to be adjusted

State: **`dist`, `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, `y2`, `i+1`, `n`, `cycles`, `res` are all integers**
