According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dist`, `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, `y2`, `i+1`, `n`, `cycles`, `res` are all integers. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i+1` needs to be less than `n`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to `i+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dist`, `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, `y2`, `i+1`, `n`, `cycles`, `res` are all integers, `i` is one less than the previous value**
