Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r` are integers. `pref_sums` is a list of lists where each sublist is [0, 0] and the list has a length of `n`. If `s[i]` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1. If `s[i]` is 'R', `u` remains unchanged and `r` is assigned the value 1. If `s[i]` is 'L', `u` remains unchanged and `r` is assigned the value -1. All other variables retain their initial values. `pref_sums[i]` is updated based on the formula provided. After executing the code, `new_x` is assigned the value of `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `new_y` is assigned the value of `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`.**
