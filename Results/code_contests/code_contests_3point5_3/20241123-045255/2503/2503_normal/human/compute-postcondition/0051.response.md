According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`, starting from 1. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r` are updated based on the provided conditions. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. `x1` should be updated to `new_x` after the calculation.
3. `y1` should be updated to `new_y` after the calculation.
4. `pref_sums[i]` should be updated based on the provided formula.
5. If `s[i]` is 'D', `u` should be set to -1.
6. If `s[i]` is 'R', `r` should be set to 1.
7. If `s[i]` is 'L', `r` should be set to -1.

State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums`, `u`, `r` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above.**
