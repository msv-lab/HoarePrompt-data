Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `pref_sums` is a list of lists where each sublist is [0, 0] and the list has a length of `n`, `u` is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition s[0] == 'U', and `r` remains 0 after the execution of the program fragment. This postcondition covers the scenario where the first element of s is 'U' and sets u to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.***
