Example Answer:
If the condition `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles` is greater than 0, then `new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles`, and `pref_sums` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `new_x` and `new_y`. Therefore, the output state is unknown.
Output State: **Unknown**
