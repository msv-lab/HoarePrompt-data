The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

1. The condition `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
2. The value of `x1` needs to be updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]` before the loop starts.
3. The value of `y1` needs to be updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]` before the loop starts.

State: **If `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles` is greater than 0, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1`]**
