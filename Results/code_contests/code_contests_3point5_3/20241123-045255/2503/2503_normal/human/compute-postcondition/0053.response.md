According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is 0, `r` is 0. Since the loop starts from 1, the next iteration will have `i` as 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `u` remains 0, `r` remains 0, and `i` becomes 1.
State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums` remain unchanged, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1**
