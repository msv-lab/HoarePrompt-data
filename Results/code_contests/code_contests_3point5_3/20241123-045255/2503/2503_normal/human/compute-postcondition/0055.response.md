According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `pref_sums` remain unchanged, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 2**
