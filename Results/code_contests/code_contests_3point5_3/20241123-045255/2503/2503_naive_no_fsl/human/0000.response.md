Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After carefully analyzing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code correctly calculates the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point based on the given wind forecast. The code considers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that the ship reaches the destination point in the minimum number of days possible. Additionally, the code handles the periodic nature of the wind forecast and adjusts the ship's movement accordingly. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
