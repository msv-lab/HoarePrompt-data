Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved by comparing the positions of the rectangles in different scenarios. It handles the cases where the second rectangle is to the left of the first rectangle, to the right of the first rectangle, or overlapping with the first rectangle. The logic implemented in the code matches the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
