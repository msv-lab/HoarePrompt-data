The function reads three integers W, a, and c from the user input, calculates values based on these inputs, and prints the result of the calculation. It calculates the difference between c and the sum of a and W if b is less than c. If d is less than a, it calculates the difference between a and the sum of c and W. If neither condition is met, it sets the result to 0.
