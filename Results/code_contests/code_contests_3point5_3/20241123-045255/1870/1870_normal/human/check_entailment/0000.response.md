Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved based on the input values of W, a, and c. It handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. The code calculates the difference between c and the sum of a and W if b is less than c. If d is less than a, it calculates the difference between a and the sum of c and W. If neither condition is met, it sets the result to 0. The code is correct for all potential cases.
