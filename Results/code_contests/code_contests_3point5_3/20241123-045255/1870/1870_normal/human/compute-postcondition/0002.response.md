Example Answer:
The value of `d` is assigned the sum of `c + W`. Since `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, and `b` is the sum of `a + W`, after running the code, the value of `d` will be `c + W`. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`, `d` is the sum of `c + W`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`, `d` is the sum of `c + W`**
