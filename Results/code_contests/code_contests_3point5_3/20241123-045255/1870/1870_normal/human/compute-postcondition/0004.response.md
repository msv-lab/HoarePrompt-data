Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `c - b`, where `b` is the sum of `a + W` and `d` is the sum of `c + W`. The condition `b` is less than `c` is already given, so the value of `ans` will be the difference between `c` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`, `d` is the sum of `c + W`, `b` is less than `c`, and `ans` is the difference between `c` and `b`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`, `d` is the sum of `c + W`, `b` is less than `c`, and `ans` is the difference between `c` and `b`**
