Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c` are integers within the specified range. `b` is the sum of `a + W`, `d` is the sum of `c + W`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `ans` is the difference between `c` and `b`. If `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is calculated as `a - d`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `d` is lower than `a`, then `ans` is `a - d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 0. The program prints `ans`.**
