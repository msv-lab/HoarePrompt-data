Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `a + W`. Given that `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, the value of `b` will be `a + W`. Since the values of `W` and `a` are known, the sum `a + W` can be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`**
