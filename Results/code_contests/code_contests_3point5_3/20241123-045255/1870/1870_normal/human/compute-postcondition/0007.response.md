Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a - d`, where `a`, `c`, `W`, `b`, and `d` are defined as specified. The calculation of `ans` depends on the values of `a` and `d` in the initial state. Since the values of `a` and `d` are not provided, the output state will include the formula `ans = a - d` without specific values for `a`, `c`, `W`, `b`, and `d`.
Output State: **`ans` is calculated as `a - d` where `a`, `c`, `W`, `b`, and `d` are integers within the specified range, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `d` is lower than `a`**
