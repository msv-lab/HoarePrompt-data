Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes three integer inputs W, a, and c and calculates the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved to connect with the first rectangle. 
The logic in the program correctly calculates the minimum distance based on the positions of the rectangles. 
The program handles all the possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output. 
Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
