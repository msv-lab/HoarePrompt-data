Example Answer: 
`d` is assigned the value of `c + W`, where `c` and `W` are specific integers. Therefore, `d` will have a specific integer value as well. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected. 
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c` are integers with specific values; `b` is a specific integer value; `d` is a specific integer value**
