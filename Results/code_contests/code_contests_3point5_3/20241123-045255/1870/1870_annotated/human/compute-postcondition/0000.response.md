Example Answer:
W, a, c are assigned the values obtained from mapping integers after splitting the input. The inputs are taken as space-separated values. Therefore, the output state is: W, a, c are integers such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5.
Output State: **W, a, c are integers such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5**
