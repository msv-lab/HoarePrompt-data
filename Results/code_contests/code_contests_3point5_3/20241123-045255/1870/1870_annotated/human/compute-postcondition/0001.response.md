Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value of `a + W`, where `W` and `a` are integers with specific values. The previous values of `a` and `W` are known, so `b` will have a specific value which is the sum of `a` and `W`. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a` and `c` are integers with specific values; `b` is a specific integer value.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c` are integers with specific values; `b` is a specific integer value**
