Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `c - b`, where `c` and `b` are integers with specific values, and `b` is less than `c`. Therefore, the result of `c - b` will be a positive integer. The other variables `W`, `a`, and `d` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, `d` are integers with specific values, `b` is less than `c`, and `ans` is a positive integer**
