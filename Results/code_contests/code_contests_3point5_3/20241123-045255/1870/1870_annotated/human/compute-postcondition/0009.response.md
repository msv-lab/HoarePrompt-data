Example Answer: 
The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected by this code snippet, the output state is: W, a, c, b, d are integers with specific values. b is greater than or equal to c. d is greater than or equal to a. 
Output State: **W, a, c, b, d are integers with specific values. b is greater than or equal to c. d is greater than or equal to a**
