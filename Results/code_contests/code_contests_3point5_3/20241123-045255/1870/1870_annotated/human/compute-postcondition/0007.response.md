Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is calculated by subtracting `d` from `a`. Since `d` is lower than `a`, the value of `ans` is the result of subtracting `d` from `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, `d` are integers with specific values. `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. `d` is lower than `a`. `ans` is the result of `a - d`**
