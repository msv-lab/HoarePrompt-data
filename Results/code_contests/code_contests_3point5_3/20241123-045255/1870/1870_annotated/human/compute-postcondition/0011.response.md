Postcondition: ***`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, `d` are integers with specific values. If `b` is less than `c`, `ans` is equal to `c - b` and is a positive integer. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is equal to `a - d`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is equal to 0.***
