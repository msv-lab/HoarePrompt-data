Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input of the two keyboard layouts and the text typed in the first layout.
2. It then creates a dictionary mapping each letter from the first layout to its index in the layout.
3. It iterates through the text, checking if each character is a digit, uppercase letter, or lowercase letter, and then converts it to the corresponding letter in the second layout based on the dictionary created.
4. It correctly handles uppercase letters by converting them to lowercase before looking up the corresponding letter in the second layout and then converting it back to uppercase.
5. It correctly ignores any characters that are not letters.
6. The program then prints the modified text with the characters converted to the second layout.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly converts the text typed in the first layout to the second layout.
