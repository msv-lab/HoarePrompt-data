According to the code, the loop will always execute since the range is set to 26. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted before the loop starts are as follows:
State: **`layout1` is a string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is an empty string, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0**
