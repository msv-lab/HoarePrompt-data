Postcondition: ***`layout1` is a non-empty string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `s` and `i` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase version of the character's corresponding value in `layout2`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated by appending the character's corresponding value in `layout2`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block.***
