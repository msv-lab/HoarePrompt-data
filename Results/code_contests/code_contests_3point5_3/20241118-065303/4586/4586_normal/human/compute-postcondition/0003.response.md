Example Answer: 
`Mods` is assigned an empty string. The values of `layout1` and `layout2` are based on user input and are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `layout1` is a string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is an empty string.
Output State: **`layout1` is a string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is an empty string**
