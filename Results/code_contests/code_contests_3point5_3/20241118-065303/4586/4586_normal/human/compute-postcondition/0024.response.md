Example Answer:
`Mods` is updated by adding the character at index `i` in string `s` to it. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The previous value of `Mods` depends on the characters in `s` and the previous value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `layout1` is a non-empty string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `s`, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`layout1` is a non-empty string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `s`, `i` is increased by 1**
