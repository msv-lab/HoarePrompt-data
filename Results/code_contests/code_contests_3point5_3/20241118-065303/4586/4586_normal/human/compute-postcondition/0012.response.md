Output State: **`layout1` is a string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is an empty string, `dic` contains key-value pairs where the key is each character of `layout1` and the value is the index of that character, `i` is at least 0. The loop will execute for all characters in `layout1` (maximum of 26 times) creating key-value pairs in `dic`. If `layout1` has less than 26 characters, the loop will not execute for the remaining iterations and `dic` will not be updated for those characters.**
