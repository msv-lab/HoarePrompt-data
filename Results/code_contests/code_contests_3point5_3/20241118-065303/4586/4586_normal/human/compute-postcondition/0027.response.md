Postcondition: ***`layout1` is a non-empty string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `s`, `i` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is uppercase, then `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase version of the character's corresponding value from `layout2`. Otherwise, `Mods` is updated by appending the character's corresponding value from `layout2`. The postcondition includes all possible scenarios based on the uppercase or lowercase nature of the character at index `i` in string `s` and the values of `layout1`, `layout2`, and `Mods` in each case.***
