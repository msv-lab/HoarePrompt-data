Postcondition: ***`layout1` is a non-empty string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `s`, `i` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a digit, `Mods` is updated by appending that digit. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase version of the corresponding value from `layout2`. Otherwise, `Mods` is updated by appending the corresponding value from `layout2`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including digits, uppercase letters, and other characters, ensuring the proper updating of `Mods` based on the conditions.***
