Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input strings `layout1` and `layout2` are not of length 26 or do not consist of distinct lowercase English letters. This is a potential edge case that the code does not cover, making it incorrect. The output hints also mention this missing edge case, confirming that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
