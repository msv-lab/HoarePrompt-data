Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two keyboard layouts and a text typed in the first layout as input. It then maps the characters from the first layout to the corresponding characters in the second layout based on the provided mappings. The program correctly handles digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters in the input text and produces the desired output where the characters are replaced according to the second layout. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
