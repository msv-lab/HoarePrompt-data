Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary with keys from characters in `layout1` and values from 0 to 25, `layout1` is a string with all 26 characters, `i` ranges from 0 to 25, s[i] is not a digit. If s[i] is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated with the uppercase value corresponding to the character in `s[i]` after converting it to lowercase and using the corresponding value from `dic` and `layout2`. If s[i] is not an uppercase letter, `Mods` is incremented by the value corresponding to s[i] in `layout2` based on the mapping from `dic`. This covers all scenarios where the character in s[i] is handled appropriately based on its case and the corresponding values from `dic` and `layout2` are used to update `Mods`.***
