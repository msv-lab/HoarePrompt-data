Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary with keys from characters in `layout1` and values from 0 to 25, `layout1` is a string with all 26 characters, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `s` is a string. If `s[i]` is a digit, `Mods` has been updated with the digit at index `i` of string `s`. If `s[i]` is an uppercase character, `Mods` has been updated with the uppercase version of the character corresponding to `s[i]` in `dic` and `layout2`. If `s[i]` is not an uppercase character, `Mods` has been updated with the character corresponding to `s[i]` in `dic` and `layout2`. The postcondition covers all edge cases, including digits, uppercase letters, and non-alphabetic characters, ensuring the proper modification of `Mods` based on the conditions met during the execution of the if else block.***
