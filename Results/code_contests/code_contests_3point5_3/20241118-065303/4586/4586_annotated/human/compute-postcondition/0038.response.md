The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the predefined parameter constraints provided. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it processes the values based on the constraints given. The function should handle the input strings `layout1`, `layout2`, and `s` as described in the constraints, without explicitly returning any value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes the strings layout1, layout2, and s according to the given constraints without returning any explicit value.**
