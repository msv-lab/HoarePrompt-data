Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary with keys from characters in `layout1` and values from 0 to 25, `layout1` is a string with all 26 characters, `i` ranges from 0 to 25, `s` is a string. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a digit, `Mods` is concatenated with that digit. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated with the uppercase value corresponding to the character in `s[i]` after converting it to lowercase and using the corresponding value from `dic` and `layout2`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not a digit or an uppercase letter, `Mods` is incremented by the value corresponding to s[i] in `layout2` based on the mapping from `dic`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios after the execution of the if-else block.***
