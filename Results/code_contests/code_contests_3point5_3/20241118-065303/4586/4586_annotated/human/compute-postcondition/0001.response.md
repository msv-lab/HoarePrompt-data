Example Answer:
`layout2` is assigned the value of the input string using `raw_input()`. The value of `layout1` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `layout1` is assigned the value of the input string; `layout2` is assigned the value of the input string.
Output State: **`layout1` is assigned the value of the input string; `layout2` is assigned the value of the input string**
