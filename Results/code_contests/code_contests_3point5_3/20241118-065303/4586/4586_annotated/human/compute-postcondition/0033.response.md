Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary with keys from characters in `layout1` and values from 0 to 25, `layout1` is a string with all 26 characters, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `s` is a string. If `s[i]` is an uppercase character, `Mods` has been updated with the uppercase version of the character corresponding to `s[i]` in `dic` and `layout2`. If `s[i]` is not an uppercase character, `Mods` has been updated with the character corresponding to `s[i]` in `dic` and `layout2`. The overall state of the program after the if else block execution covers all edge cases including uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabetic characters.***
