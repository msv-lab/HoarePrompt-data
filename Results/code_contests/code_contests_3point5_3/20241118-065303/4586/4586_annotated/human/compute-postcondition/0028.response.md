Postcondition: ***`dic` is a dictionary with keys from characters in `layout1` and values from 0 to 25, `layout1` is a string with all 26 characters, `i` is one more increment than the initial value, `s` is a string. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a digit, then `Mods` has been updated by adding that digit. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is uppercase, then `Mods` has been updated by adding the uppercase equivalent of `layout2[dic[s[i].lower()]]`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is neither a digit nor uppercase, then `Mods` has been updated by adding `layout2[dic[s[i]]]`. The program accounts for all edge cases such as `s` having a lowercase character at index `i`, an uppercase character at index `i`, or `i` exceeding the length of `s`.***
