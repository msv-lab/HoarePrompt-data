Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the depth of the snow cover as described in the problem statement. The formula used in the program `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` is incorrect.

For example, if we take the input `8 13`, the expected output should be `2` according to the problem description. However, the program will output `-4` instead.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output for all potential cases.
