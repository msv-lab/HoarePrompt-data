Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The formula used in the code `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` does not accurately calculate the depth of the snow cover. The correct formula to calculate the depth of the snow cover between two towers with heights a and b should be `b - a - 1`. 

For example, if we take the input (8, 13), the correct output should be 4 (13 - 8 - 1 = 4) based on the problem description. However, the code will output 2 which is incorrect. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
