Example Answer:
The code calculates the expression (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a. Since the initial state guarantees that a < b, the result of this expression depends on the values of a and b. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500**
