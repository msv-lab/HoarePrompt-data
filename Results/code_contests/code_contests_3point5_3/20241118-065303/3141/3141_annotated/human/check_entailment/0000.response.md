Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the amount of snow cover as described in the problem. The formula used in the program `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` does not match the correct formula to calculate the depth of snow cover for the towers.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
8 13

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output (from the program):
-4

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output for at least one input case.
