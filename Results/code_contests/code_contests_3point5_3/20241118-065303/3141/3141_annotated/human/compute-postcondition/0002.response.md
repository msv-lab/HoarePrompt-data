The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints provided for integers `a` and `b`. The integers `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition 1 <= a < b < 499500. The function would then perform a specific operation or calculation using these integers `a` and `b` and return the result.
