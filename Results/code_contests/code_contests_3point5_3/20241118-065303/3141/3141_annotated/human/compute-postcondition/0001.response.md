Example Answer:
The code calculates a mathematical expression using the values of `a` and `b`. The result of the expression is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500, their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state will be in terms of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **The result of the expression is dependent on the specific values of `a` and `b` within the given constraints.**
