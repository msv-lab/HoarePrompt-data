The function `func` reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input, calculates a specific operation using these integers, and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. The provided constraint 1 <= a < b < 499500 must be satisfied for the function to execute correctly. The function calculates (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a and prints the result. If the constraint is not met, the function may behave unexpectedly or encounter errors.
