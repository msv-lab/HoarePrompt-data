The function `func` reads input values, assumes the existence of parameters n, s, t based on constraints, and then performs a specific calculation on the input values to produce an output. The function does not explicitly state what it returns, but it calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation involving the input values. The provided annotations do not accurately describe the actual functionality of the code, as they mention shuffling operation parameters which are not present in the code. It is unclear what the specific calculation is based on the code alone.
