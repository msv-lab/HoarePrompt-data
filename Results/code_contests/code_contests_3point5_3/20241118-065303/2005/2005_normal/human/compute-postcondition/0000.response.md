Example Answer:
The lambda function `IN` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object. However, the values of n, s, and t are not assigned, and the shuffling operation parameters are not processed. Therefore, the Output State is: n, s, and t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= s, t <= n. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **n, s, and t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= s, t <= n**
