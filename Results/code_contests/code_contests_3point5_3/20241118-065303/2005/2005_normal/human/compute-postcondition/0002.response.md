The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it implicitly assumes the existence of the parameters n, s, t based on the provided constraints. The function processes the shuffling operation parameters and returns a specific output based on the input values. The return value of the function is not explicitly mentioned in the task description.
