Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the difference between the sum of the input values twice and negates it. This does not accurately determine the minimum number of shuffling operations needed to move the marble from position s to position t. The program does not take into account the actual shuffling operations and their impact on the marble's movement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
