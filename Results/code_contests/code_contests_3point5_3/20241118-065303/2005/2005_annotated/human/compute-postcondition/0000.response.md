Example Answer: 
The lambda function `IN` reads input values as integers and splits them based on spaces. The function `map` applies the `int` function to each element obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since the initial state does not mention any variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Precondition: n, s, t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= s, t <= n. The integers p1, p2, ..., pn are distinct and such that 1 <= pi <= n.**
