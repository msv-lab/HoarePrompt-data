Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The provided code simply calculates the difference between the sum of the input values, but it does not handle the shuffling operations as described in the problem. For example, in the case where the marble cannot move from position s to position t, the program does not return -1 as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the shuffling operations and conditions specified in the problem.
