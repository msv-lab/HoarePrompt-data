Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through all possible combinations of stones, calculates the volume of the sphere that can be carved from the glued stones, and selects the optimal combination based on the maximum volume. The program considers all possible rotations and flips of the stones while gluing them together. Additionally, it handles the case where only one stone can be chosen as a present. Overall, the program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output.
