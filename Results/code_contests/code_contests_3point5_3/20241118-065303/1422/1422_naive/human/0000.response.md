Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program considers all possible pairs of stones, calculates the volume of the new parallelepiped formed by gluing them together, and then finds the pair that results in the maximum possible volume. It also considers the option of choosing only one stone if it results in a larger volume than any pair. The logic seems to be correctly implemented and covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The program outputs the correct number of stones to choose and their indices based on the maximum volume calculation.
