Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input data correctly and stores the dimensions of the stones in appropriate data structures.
- It then iterates through the stones and calculates the possible volumes of glued stones based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
- The code determines the best combination of stones to maximize the volume of the carved sphere and prints the output accordingly.
- The output format also matches the requirements of the problem description.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the logic implemented aligns with the given requirements.
