Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2. Variables `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `ans`, `two`, `first`, `second`, `third` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block. If `second` is in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple with calculated values is appended to `ans`. This postcondition covers the case where `second` is in `one` and all associated variables are appropriately updated.***
