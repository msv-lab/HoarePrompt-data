Example Answer:
The tuple (a, b, c) is appended to the list `challengers`. All variables retain their original values and relationships. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2 (incremented for the next iteration), `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `ans`, and `two` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block, and all other variables retain their original values and relationships.
