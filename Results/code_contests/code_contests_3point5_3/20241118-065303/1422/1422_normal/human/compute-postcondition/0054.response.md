Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space. The initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `one[first]` is updated, `one[second]` is updated, `one[third]` is updated, all other variables and data structures retain their initial values and relationships, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values from the input.
