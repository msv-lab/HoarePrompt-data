Postcondition: ***If there are tuples in `ans`, `label` is set to 1. `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. `first` is incremented by 1. The variables `second`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `third`, and `two` remain unchanged. If there are no tuples in `ans` or the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not greater than `cnt`, then no changes are made to any of the variables. After the execution of the if else block, the program will output either '1' followed by the incremented value of `first`, or '2' followed by the incremented values of `first` and `second` respectively.***
