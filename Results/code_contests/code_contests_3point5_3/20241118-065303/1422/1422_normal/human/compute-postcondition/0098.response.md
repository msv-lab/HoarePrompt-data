Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2. `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `ans`, `two`, `first`, `second`, `third` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block. If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with values calculated from `one[first][0] + c`, `first[0]`, `first[1]`, `one[first][1]`, and `i`. Subsequently, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `one`, `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple containing this sum, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge cases of the program fragment.***
