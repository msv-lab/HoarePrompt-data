Postcondition: ***All variables `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `ans`, `two`, `first`, `second`, `third` are updated based on the following conditions: If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with values calculated from `one[third][0] + a`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i`, followed by updating `two[third]` to `one[third][0] + a`. If `third` is not in `two` but present in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and a tuple is added to `ans` containing the sum, the elements of `third`, and relevant values from `one`. If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with values calculated from `one[second][0] + b`, `second[0]`, `second[1]`, `one[second][1]`, and `i`, followed by updating `two[second]` to `one[second][0] + b`. If `second` is not in `two` but present in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple is appended to `ans` containing the sum, the elements of `second`, and relevant values from `one`. Moreover, if `first` is not in `one` or `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, `one[first]` is updated to `c, i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases comprehensively.***
