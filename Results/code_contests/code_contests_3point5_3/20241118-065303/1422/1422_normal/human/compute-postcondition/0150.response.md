Postcondition: ***`label` is set to 1. `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. `first` is assigned the value of `i`. The variables `second`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `third`, and `two` remain unchanged. This condition holds when the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`.***
