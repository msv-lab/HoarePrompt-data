Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` and `two` are dictionaries. If `first` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`, `one[first]` is updated to `(c, i)`. After entering the if condition, if `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to `(b, i)`. All other variables and data structures retain their initial values and relationships.***
