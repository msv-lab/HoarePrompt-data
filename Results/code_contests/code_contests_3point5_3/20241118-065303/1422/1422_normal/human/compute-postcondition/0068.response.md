Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `one[first]`, `one[second]`, `one[third]`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `first`, `second`, `third`, `ans`, and `two` are modified as follows: If `second` is such that `two[second]` is less than the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `c`, then a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`, values of `second`, the first and second elements of `second` in `one`, the second element of `one[second]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`, and `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. All other variables and data structures maintain their original values and relationships.***
