Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of integers extracted by mapping `int` to the input values obtained from `stdin.readline().split()`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now determined by the input provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned specific integer values.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned specific integer values**
