Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` and `two` are dictionaries, `ans` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first`, `second`, and `third` retain their specific integer values. `second` is not in `two`, `two` is updated with the sum of the value in `one` corresponding to `second` at index 0 and `c`, and a tuple with these values is appended to `ans`.***
