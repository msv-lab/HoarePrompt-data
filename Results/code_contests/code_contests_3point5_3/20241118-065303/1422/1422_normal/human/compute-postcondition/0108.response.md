Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2. Variables `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `ans`, `two`, `first`, `second`, `third` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block. If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with values calculated from `one[third][0] + a`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i`. Subsequently, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `second` is not in `two` but present in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple is appended to `ans` containing the sum, the elements of `second`, and relevant values from `one`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases comprehensively.***
