Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` and `two` are dictionaries, `ans` contains tuples based on conditions, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first`, `second`, and `third` retain their specific integer values. If `second` is in `one`, `two` is updated with the sum of the value in `one` corresponding to `second` at index 0 and `c`, and a tuple with these values is appended to `ans`. All other variables and data structures maintain their initial values and relationships.***
