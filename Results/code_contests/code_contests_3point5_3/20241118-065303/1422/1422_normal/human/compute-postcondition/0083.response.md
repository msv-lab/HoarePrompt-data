Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `one[first]`, `one[second]`, `one[third]`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `first`, `second`, `third`, `ans`, and `two` are updated as follows: If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `c`, a tuple is appended to `ans` containing the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`, values of `second`, elements of `second` in `one`, the second element of `one[second]`, and `i`, and `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`. If `second` is in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`, and a tuple with similar values is appended to `ans`. In the case where `two[third]` is less than the sum of the first element of `one[third]` and `c`, `ans` appends a tuple with the sum of the first element of `one[third]` and `a`, values of `third`, elements of `third` in `one`, the second element of `one[third]`, and `i`, and `two[third]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[third]` and `a`. If `first` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to `c, i`. All other variables and data structures retain their original values and relationships.***
