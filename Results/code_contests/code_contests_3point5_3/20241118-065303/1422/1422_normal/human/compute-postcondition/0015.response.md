Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` and `two` are empty dictionaries, `ans` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first`, `second`, and `third` are assigned specific integer values. If the value in the dictionary `two` corresponding to `first` is less than the sum of the value in `one` corresponding to `first` at index 0 and `c`, then a tuple is appended to `ans` with calculated values and the value in `two` at index `first` is updated.***
