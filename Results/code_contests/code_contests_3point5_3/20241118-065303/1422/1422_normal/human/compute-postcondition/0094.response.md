Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `ans`, `two`, `first`, `second`, `third` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block. If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with values calculated from `one[first][0] + c`, `first[0]`, `first[1]`, `one[first][1]`, and `i`. Subsequently, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`.***
