Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `one[first]`, `one[second]`, `one[third]` are updated, all other variables and data structures retain their initial values and relationships, `(a, b, c)` is appended to the `challengers` list, `first` is updated to the maximum of `a` and `b`, and minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` is updated to the maximum of `a` and `c`, and minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is updated to the maximum of `b` and `c`, and minimum of `b` and `c`. If `first` is in `one`, `two[first]` is updated to the first element of `one[first] plus `c`, and `ans` appends a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `one[first] and `c`, values of `first`, the first and second elements of `first` in `one`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i`.***
