Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` and `two` are dictionaries. If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a tuple is appended to `ans` with calculated values `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `second` is not in `two` but in `one`, `two[second]` is updated with the sum of `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple with these values is appended to `ans`. All other variables and data structures retain their initial values and relationships. `third` is in the dictionary `two`.***
