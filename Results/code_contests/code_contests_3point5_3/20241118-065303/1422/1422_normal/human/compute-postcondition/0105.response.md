Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2. Variables `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `ans`, `two`, `first`, `second`, `third` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block. If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with values calculated from `one[second][0] + b`, `second[0]`, `second[1]`, `one[second][1]`, and `i`. After this, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `second` is not in `two` but present in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple is appended to `ans` containing the sum, the elements of `second`, and relevant values from `one`. This postcondition comprehensively covers all possible scenarios, including edge cases.***
