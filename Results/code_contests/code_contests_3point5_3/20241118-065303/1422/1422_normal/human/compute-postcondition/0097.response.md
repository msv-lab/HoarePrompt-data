Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2. Variables `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `first`, `second`, `third`, `ans`, and `two[first]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block. `first` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, `third` is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum of `b` and `c`. If `first` is in `one`, `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple containing this sum, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge cases of the program fragment.***
