Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` and `two` are dictionaries. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, a tuple is appended to `ans` with values `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `third` is not in `two` but in `one`, `two[third]` is updated with the sum of `one[third][0] + a`, and a tuple with these values is appended to `ans`. All other variables and data structures retain their initial values and relationships. In addition, if `(first not in one or one[first][0] < c)` is true, then the described operations are executed, and the state of the program variables is as described.***
