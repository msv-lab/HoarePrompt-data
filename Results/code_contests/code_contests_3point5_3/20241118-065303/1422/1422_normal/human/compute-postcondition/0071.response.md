Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `one[first]`, `one[second]`, `one[third]`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `first`, `second`, `third`, `ans` have been appropriately updated based on the conditions met during the execution of the if-else block. If `second` is in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`, and a tuple containing these values is appended to `ans`. All other variables and data structures maintain their original values and relationships.***
