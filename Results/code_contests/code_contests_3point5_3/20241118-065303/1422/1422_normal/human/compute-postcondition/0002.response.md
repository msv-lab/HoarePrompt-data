`two` is assigned an empty dictionary. The dictionary was empty before, so after execution, `two` remains an empty dictionary. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary**
