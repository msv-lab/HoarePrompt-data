Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2. `one`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `ans`, `first`, `second`, `third` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with values calculated from `one[second][0] + b`, `second[0]`, `second[1]`, `one[second][1]`, and `i`. Subsequently, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. This comprehensive postcondition covers all the possible cases and edge cases of the program fragment.***
