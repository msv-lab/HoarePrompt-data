Postcondition: ***`label` is 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is assigned the value of `i`, `second`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `third`, and `two` remain unchanged, `i` is less than `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have new values from challengers at index i. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated with the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is assigned the value of `i`.***
