Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `one[first]`, `one[second]`, `one[third]`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `first`, `second`, `third`, `ans`, and `two` are updated accordingly: If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `c`, a tuple is appended to `ans` containing the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`, values of `second`, elements of `second` in `one`, the second element of `one[second]`, and `i`, and `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`. If `second` is in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`, and a tuple with similar values is appended to `ans`. All other variables and data structures maintain their original values and relationships.***
