Output State: **If the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` in each tuple of `ans` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2. In that case, `cnt` is updated to the new minimum value, `first` is updated to the value of `ind1`, and `second` is updated to the value of `ind2`. `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `third`, and `two` retain their initial values. If there are no tuples in `ans` or the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is not greater than `cnt`, then no changes are made to any of the variables**
