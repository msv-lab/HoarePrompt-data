Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`, `two` is a dictionary containing the key `first` with a value of `one[first][0] + c`, `ans` is a list containing the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned specific integer values, `first` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `b`, and the minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`, `first` is not in `two`, and `first` is in `one`.***
