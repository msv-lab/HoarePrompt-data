Postcondition: ***`label` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `first`, `second`, `third`, `ans` contain at least one more tuple, `two` retains its initial value. `cnt` is updated to the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c`. `ind1` is updated to the value of `a`, `ind2` is updated to the value of `b`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the current value of `cnt`, `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the new minimum value, `first` is updated to the value of `ind1`, and `second` is updated to the value of `ind2`.***
