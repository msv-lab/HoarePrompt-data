Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `one[first]`, `one[second]`, and `one[third]` are updated, all other variables and data structures retain their initial values and relationships, `(a, b, c)` are the new input values appended to the `challengers` list, `first` is updated to the maximum of `a` and `b`, and minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` is updated to the maximum of `a` and `c`, and minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is updated to the maximum of `b` and `c`, and minimum of `b` and `c`, `ans` contains the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`.***
