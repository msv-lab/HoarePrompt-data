Postcondition: ***`label` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, `challengers`, `first`, `second`, `third`, `ans` contain at least one more tuple, `two` retains its initial value. If the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `cnt` is updated to that minimum value. The values of `first` and `second` are updated to `ind1` and `ind2`, respectively. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. `ind1` and `ind2` retain their values from the last iteration.***
