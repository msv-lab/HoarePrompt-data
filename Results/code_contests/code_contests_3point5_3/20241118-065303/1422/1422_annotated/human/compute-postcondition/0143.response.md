Output State: **When the loop executes, if the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans is greater than the current value of cnt, then label is updated to 2, cnt is updated to that minimum value, first is set to ind1, and second is set to ind2. This pattern continues for each tuple in ans. If the loop does not execute at all, label remains 0, cnt remains 0, first remains 0, second remains 0.**
