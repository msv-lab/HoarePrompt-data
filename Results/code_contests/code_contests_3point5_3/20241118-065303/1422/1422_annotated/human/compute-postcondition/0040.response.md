Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `one`, `two`, `ans` are dictionaries, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `first`, `second`, `third` are tuples. If `third` is in the dictionary `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to be equal to the value of the first element of the tuple stored in `one[third]` plus the value of `a`.**
