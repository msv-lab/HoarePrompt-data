Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that have been added to the `challengers` list. `first`, `second`, and `third` store the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `c`, and the maximum and minimum values between `b` and `c` respectively. If `first` is not in `one` or the first element in `one[first]` is less than `c`, `one[first]` is updated to `c, i`. Additionally, if `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `c`, a tuple is appended to `ans` with the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `c`, the elements in `third`, the second element in `one[third]`, and `i`. `two[third]` is then updated to the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `c`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `a`, and a tuple is appended to `ans` with this sum, the elements in `third`, the second element in `one[third]`, and `i`. This postcondition ensures the correct updating and appending of values in the data structures, handling all edge cases and scenarios appropriately. `one[second]` is assigned the value `b, i`.**
