Postcondition: ***`label` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` which is greater than the initial `cnt`, `first` is the index `i` if the condition is met, `second` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the list `challengers[i+1]`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` from the list `challengers[i+1]` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to that minimum value, and `first` is set to `i`.***
