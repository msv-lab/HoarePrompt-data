According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are tuples in the list `ans`. To ensure the loop executes, `ans` needs to have at least one tuple. Before the loop starts, label is 0 and cnt is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, label should remain 0, cnt should remain 0, and a, b, c should be initialized according to the values in the first tuple of `ans`, and ind1, ind2 should be initialized to 0.
State: **`label` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are initialized according to the first tuple in `ans`, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0**
