Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, one, two, ans are dictionaries, challengers contains a tuple (a, b, c), i is 0, first, second, third are tuples as described, first is in the dictionary two. If two[first] is less than one[first][0] + c, a tuple containing (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to ans, and two[first] is updated to one[first][0] + c. If two[first] is not less than one[first][0] + c, no changes are made to the dictionaries or lists.***
