According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `n` being greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, all other variables remain unchanged**
