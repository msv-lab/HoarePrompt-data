Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `one`, `two`, `ans` are dictionaries, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `first`, `second`, `third` are tuples. If `third` is in the dictionary `one`, the described operations are performed on the dictionaries and lists as mentioned in the precondition.***
