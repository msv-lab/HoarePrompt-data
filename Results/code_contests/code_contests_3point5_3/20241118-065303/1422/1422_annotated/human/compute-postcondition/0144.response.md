According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: label is 0, cnt is 0, first is 0, and second is 0. Since the loop is responsible for updating these states based on the conditions mentioned, the initial values need to be set accordingly for the loop to execute successfully.
State: **label is 0, cnt is 0, first is 0, second is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
