Postcondition: ***`label` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` which is greater than the initial `cnt`, `first` is the index `i` if the condition is met, `second` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the list `challengers[i]`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not greater than the initial `cnt`, then `label` remains 0, `cnt`, `first`, and the other variables retain their initial values. If n is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain 0.***
