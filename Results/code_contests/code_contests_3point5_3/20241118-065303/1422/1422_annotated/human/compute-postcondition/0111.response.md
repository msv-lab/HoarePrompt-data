Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that have been added to the `challengers` list. The maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `c`, and the maximum and minimum values between `b` and `c` are stored in `first`, `second`, and `third` respectively. If `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `a`, and a tuple is appended to `ans` containing this sum, the elements in `third`, the second element in `one[third]`, and `i`. The postcondition ensures that all possible scenarios are covered, including the correct updating and appending of values in the relevant data structures without affecting any other variables.***
