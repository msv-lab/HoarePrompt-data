Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `one`, `two`, `ans` are dictionaries, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `first`, `second`, `third` are tuples. If `first` is in dictionary `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c. If `first` is not in `two` but is in `one`, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not in either `one` or `two`, no changes are made to the dictionaries or lists. `second` is in dictionary `two`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b. If `second` is not in `two` but is in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not in either `one` or `two`, no changes are made to the dictionaries or lists. `third` is in dictionary `two`. If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a.***
