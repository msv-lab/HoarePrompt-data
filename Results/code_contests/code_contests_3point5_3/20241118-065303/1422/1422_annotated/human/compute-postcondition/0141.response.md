Postcondition: ***label is updated to 2, cnt is set to the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans. a, b, and c are initialized according to the next tuple in ans. ind1 is updated based on the next tuple in ans. ind2 is updated based on the next tuple in ans. first is updated to the value of ind1. second is updated to the value of ind2. If the minimum value among a, b, and c is greater than cnt, then label is set to 2, cnt is updated to that minimum value, first is set to ind1, and second is set to ind2. This encompasses all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
