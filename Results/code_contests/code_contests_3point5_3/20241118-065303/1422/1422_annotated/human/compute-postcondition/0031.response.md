Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `one`, `two`, `ans` are dictionaries. `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`. `i` is 0. `first`, `second`, `third` are tuples. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not in `one`, no changes are made to the dictionaries or lists. All other variables remain unchanged.***
