Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `one` is a dictionary containing the value `first`, `two` is a dictionary containing the value of `first` as key and the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c` as value, `ans` is a list containing the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `first` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `b` as the first value and the minimum of `a` and `b` as the second value, `second` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `c` as the first value and the minimum of `a` and `c` as the second value, `third` is a tuple containing the maximum of `b` and `c` as the first value and the minimum of `b` and `c` as the second value, `(first in two)` is false. If `first` is in dictionary `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to list `ans`.***
