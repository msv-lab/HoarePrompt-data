Postcondition: ***After the execution of the program fragment, with the initial state as described in the precondition, the following holds true: `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are specific integer values, `challengers` list contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `b`, and the minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then a tuple `((one[first][0] + c), first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[first]` is updated to the value of `one[first][0] + c`.***
