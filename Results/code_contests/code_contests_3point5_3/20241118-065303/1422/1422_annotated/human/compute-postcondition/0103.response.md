Example Answer:
The value of `two[second]` is assigned the sum of the first element in `one[second]` and `b`. After that, a tuple is appended to the `ans` list containing the sum of the first element in `one[second]` and `b`, `second[0]`, `second[1]`, the second element in `one[second]`, and `i`. This operation does not affect the other variables. 
Output State: **`two[second]` is assigned the sum of the first element in `one[second]` and `b`, `ans` list is updated with a new tuple**
