Example Answer: 
The value of `cnt` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are initialized according to the next tuple in `ans`. Therefore, the output state is: label is 2, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` from the next tuple in `ans`, `a`, `b`, `c` are initialized according to the next tuple in `ans`, `ind1` is updated based on the next tuple in `ans`, `ind2` is updated based on the next tuple in `ans`, `first` is updated based on the next tuple in `ans`, and `second` is updated based on the next tuple in `ans`.
Output State: **label is 2, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` from the next tuple in `ans`, `a`, `b`, `c` are initialized according to the next tuple in `ans`, `ind1` is updated based on the next tuple in `ans`, `ind2` is updated based on the next tuple in `ans`, `first` is updated based on the next tuple in `ans`, and `second` is updated based on the next tuple in `ans`**
