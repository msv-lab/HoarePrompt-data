Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the standard input and then proceeds to read `n` lines of input containing three integers each. It processes these inputs by calculating certain values based on the input integers and stores them in dictionaries and lists. After processing, it determines specific labels and values based on the processed data. Finally, it writes either '1' followed by an index or '2' followed by two indices to the standard output, depending on the calculated labels. The function does not return any specific value.**
