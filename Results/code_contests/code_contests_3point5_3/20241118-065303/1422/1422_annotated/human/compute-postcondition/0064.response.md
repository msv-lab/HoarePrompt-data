Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are specific integer values, `challengers` list contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first`, `second`, and `third` are assigned the maximum and minimum values of the given integers. If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to be the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[first]` and `c`, and `ans` appends a tuple containing the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[first]` and `c`, the first and second elements of `first`, the second element of the tuple in `one[first]`, and `i`.***
