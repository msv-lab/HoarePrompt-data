Example Answer:
`(a, b, c)` are appended to the `challengers` list as a tuple. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are already assigned integers from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input, and `(a, b, c)` is added to the `challengers` list.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input, and `(a, b, c)` is added to the `challengers` list**
