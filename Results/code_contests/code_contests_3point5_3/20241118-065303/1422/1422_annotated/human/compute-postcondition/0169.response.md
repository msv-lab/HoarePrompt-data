Postcondition: ***If label is 1, then the minimum value among a, b, and c which is greater than the initial cnt is updated in cnt, and the index i is updated in first. If label is 0 and n > 0, then the minimum value among a, b, and c is not greater than the initial cnt, and the initial values of cnt, first, and other variables are retained. If n <= 0, the loop does not execute, and label, cnt, first, and second remain 0. In both cases, after the execution of the if else block, the program writes either '1' followed by the index i incremented by 1 or '2' followed by the index i incremented by 1 and the variable second incremented by 1.***
