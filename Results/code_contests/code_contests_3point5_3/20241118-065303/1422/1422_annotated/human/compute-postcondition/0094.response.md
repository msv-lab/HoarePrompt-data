Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input and added to the `challengers` list. `first`, `second`, and `third` contain the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `c`, and the maximum and minimum values between `b` and `c` respectively. If `two[first]` is less than the sum of the first element in `one[first] and `c`, a tuple is appended to `ans` with the sum of the first element in `one[first] and `c`, the elements in `first`, the second element in `one[first]`, and `i`. Additionally, `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element in `one[first] and `c`.***
