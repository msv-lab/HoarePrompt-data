Example Answer:
The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned by converting the input values to integers using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact input values, the output state will depend on the specific input values provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned specific integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned specific integer values based on the input**
