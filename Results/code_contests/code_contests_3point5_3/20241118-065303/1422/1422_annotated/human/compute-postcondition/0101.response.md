Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that have been added to the `challengers` list. `first`, `second`, and `third` contain the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `c`, and the maximum and minimum values between `b` and `c`, respectively. If `two[first]` was less than the sum of the first element in `one[first] and `c`, a tuple has been appended to `ans` with the sum of the first element in `one[first] and `c`, the elements in `first`, the second element in `one[first]`, and `i`. Additionally, `two[first]` has been updated to the sum of the first element in `one[first] and `c`. If `first` is not in `two` and `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` has been updated to the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple has been appended to `ans` containing this sum, the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i`. In all other cases, no changes have occurred in the variables and data structures.***
