Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the state of the program variables is as follows: `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are specific integer values, `challengers` list contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `b`, and the minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[third]` and `a`, and a tuple `((one[third][0] + a), third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. The relationships between the variables and the specific conditions are maintained, covering all edge cases and scenarios within the program logic.***
