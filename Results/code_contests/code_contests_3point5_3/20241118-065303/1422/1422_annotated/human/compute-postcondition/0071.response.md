Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, with the initial state as described in the precondition, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are specific integer values, `challengers` list contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`, `first` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `b`, and the minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to be the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[second]` and `b`, and a tuple containing this sum, the elements of `second`, the second element of the tuple in `one[second]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not in `one`, no changes are made. All other variables and data structures remain unchanged.***
