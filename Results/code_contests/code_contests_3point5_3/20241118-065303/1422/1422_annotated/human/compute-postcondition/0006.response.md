Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input read from `stdin`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `stdin`, we cannot determine the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
