Example Answer:
`first` is assigned the maximum value between `a` and `b` as the first element, and the minimum value between `a` and `b` as the second element. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected, but the tuple `(a, b, c)` is added to the `challengers` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input and added to the `challengers` list, `first` contains the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input and added to the `challengers` list, `first` contains the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b**`.
