According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of a, b, and c in the next tuple in ans. If the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans is greater than the current value of cnt, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, label is updated to 2, cnt is set to the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans, a, b, and c are initialized according to the next tuple in ans, ind1 is updated based on the next tuple in ans, ind2 is updated based on the next tuple in ans, first is updated to the value of ind1, and second is updated to the value of ind2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans must be greater than the current value of cnt.
State: **label is updated to 2, cnt is set to the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans, a, b, and c are initialized according to the next tuple in ans, ind1 is updated based on the next tuple in ans, ind2 is updated based on the next tuple in ans, first is updated to the value of ind1, second is updated to the value of ind2**
