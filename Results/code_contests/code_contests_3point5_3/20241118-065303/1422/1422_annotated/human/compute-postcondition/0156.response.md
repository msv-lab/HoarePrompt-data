Postcondition: ***`label` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` which is greater than the initial `cnt`, `first` is the index `i`, `second` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the list `challengers[i]`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the initial cnt, then label is set to 1, cnt is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and first is updated to the index i. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
