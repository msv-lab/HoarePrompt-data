Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that have been added to the `challengers` list. `first`, `second`, and `third` store the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `c`, and the maximum and minimum values between `b` and `c` respectively. If `first` is not in `one` or the first element in `one[first]` is less than `c`, `one[first]` is updated to `c, i`. Additionally, if `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `c`, a tuple is appended to `ans` with the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `c`, the elements in `third`, the second element in `one[third]`, and `i`. `two[third]` is then updated to the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `c`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to the sum of the first element in `one[third]` and `a`, and a tuple is appended to `ans` with this sum, the elements in `third`, the second element in `one[third]`, and `i`. This postcondition ensures the correct updating and appending of values in the data structures, handling all edge cases and scenarios appropriately. After the execution of the if else block, the state of the program is maintained with appropriate updates and appends based on the conditions specified, ensuring the integrity of the data structures and handling edge cases effectively. `one[third]` is assigned the values `a, i`.**
