Example Answer:
`third` is assigned the maximum value between `b` and `c` and the minimum value between `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are provided from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input and added to the `challengers` list, `first` contains the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b, `second` contains the maximum value between `a` and `c` and the minimum value between `a` and `c`, `third` contains the maximum value between `b` and `c` and the minimum value between `b` and `c`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input and added to the `challengers` list, `first` contains the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b, `second` contains the maximum value between `a` and `c` and the minimum value between `a` and `c`, `third` contains the maximum value between `b` and `c` and the minimum value between `b` and `c`**
