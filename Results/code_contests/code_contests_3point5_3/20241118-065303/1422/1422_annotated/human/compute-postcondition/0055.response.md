Example Answer: 
A tuple of `(a, b, c)` is appended to the `challengers` list. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` already have specific integer values assigned based on the input. After execution, the `challengers` list will contain the tuple `(a, b, c)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned specific integer values based on the input, `challengers` list contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned specific integer values based on the input, `challengers` list contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`**
