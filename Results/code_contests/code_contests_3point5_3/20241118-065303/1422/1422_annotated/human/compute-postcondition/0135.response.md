Postcondition: ***label is updated to 2. cnt is set to the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans. a, b, and c are initialized according to the next tuple in ans. ind1 is updated based on the next tuple in ans. ind2 is updated based on the next tuple in ans. first is updated to the value of ind1. second is updated to the value of ind2. This occurs when the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans is greater than the current value of cnt. If the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans is not greater than the current value of cnt, no changes are made to the variables.***
