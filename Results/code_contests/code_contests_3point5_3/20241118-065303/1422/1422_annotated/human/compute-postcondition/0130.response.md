According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the minimum value among them is greater than `cnt`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `label` is 2, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, `a`, `b`, `c` are initialized according to the first tuple in `ans`, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `first` is 0, and `second` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` should be initialized according to the next tuple in `ans`.
- `ind1` should be updated to the next value based on the tuple in `ans`.
- `ind2` should be updated to the next value based on the tuple in `ans`.
- `first` should be updated to the next value based on the tuple in `ans`.
- `second` should be updated to the next value based on the tuple in `ans`.

State: **label is 2, cnt is the minimum value among a, b, and c from the next tuple in ans, a, b, c are initialized according to the next tuple in ans, ind1 is updated based on the next tuple in ans, ind2 is updated based on the next tuple in ans, first is updated based on the next tuple in ans, and second is updated based on the next tuple in ans.**
