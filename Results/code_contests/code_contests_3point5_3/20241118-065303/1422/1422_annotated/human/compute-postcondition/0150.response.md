Postcondition: ***label is either 0 or 1, cnt is the minimum value among a, b, and c which is greater than the initial cnt, first is the index i, second is 0, n is greater than 0, a, b, and c are assigned values from the list challengers[i]. If the minimum value among a, b, and c is greater than cnt, label is 1, cnt is updated to that minimum value, and first is set to i. Otherwise, label remains 0, and cnt, first, and the other variables retain their initial values.***
