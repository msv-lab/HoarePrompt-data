Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list. `first` contains the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, `second` contains the maximum value between `a` and `c` and the minimum value between `a` and `c`, `third` contains the maximum value between `b` and `c` and the minimum value between `b` and `c`. If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple is appended to `ans` containing this sum, the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program execution.***
