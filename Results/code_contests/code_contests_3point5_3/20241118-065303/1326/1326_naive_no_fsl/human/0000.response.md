Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the given problem description. It takes input for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, and the permutation itself. It then checks if the permutation can be split into two arrays a and b such that they can be merged to form the given permutation. The logic of splitting the permutation into two arrays is implemented correctly according to the rules provided in the problem description. The program outputs "YES" if it is possible to split the permutation into two arrays, otherwise it outputs "NO". The program handles multiple test cases and provides the correct output for each case.
