Based on the code provided and the problem description, the program seems to correctly implement the logic of merging two arrays `a` and `b` to form a permutation array `p`. The code takes into account the conditions specified in the problem description for merging the arrays.

The output hints provide a clear explanation of how the function `func_4` processes the input array `P` to determine if it can be split into two arrays `a` and `b` such that merging them results in the permutation array `p`. The hints also mention that the program should output "YES" if the arrays `a` and `b` can be formed, otherwise it should output "NO".

After reviewing the code and output hints, it seems that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The code handles the merging of arrays `a` and `b` correctly based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
