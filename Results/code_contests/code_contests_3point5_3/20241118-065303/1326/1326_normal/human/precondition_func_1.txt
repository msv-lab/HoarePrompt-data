**Precondition**: 
- The input consists of t test cases, where t is a single integer between 1 and 1000.
- Each test case consists of two lines.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer n, where n is between 1 and 2000.
- The second line of each test case contains 2n integers p_1,...,p_{2n}, where each p_i is between 1 and 2n, and the list p is a permutation.
- The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2000.
