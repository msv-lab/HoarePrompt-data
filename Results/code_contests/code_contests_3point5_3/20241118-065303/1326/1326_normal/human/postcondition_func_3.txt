The function `func_4` accepts a positive integer parameter `N`, representing the length of arrays `a` and `b`. Within the function, two lists `a` and `b` are initialized with a single element of 10^5 each. The function then iterates over elements in the list `P` in reverse order and populates `a` and `b` based on certain conditions. If the length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, the variable `fail` is set to True. Finally, based on the value of `fail`, the function prints 'NO' if True and 'YES' if False. The function does not explicitly return any values.
