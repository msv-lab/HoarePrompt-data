Example Answer:
`b` is assigned a list containing the value `10 ** 5`, which evaluates to 100000. The value of `a` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing the value 10, `b` is a list containing the value 100000.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing the value 10, `b` is a list containing the value 100000**
