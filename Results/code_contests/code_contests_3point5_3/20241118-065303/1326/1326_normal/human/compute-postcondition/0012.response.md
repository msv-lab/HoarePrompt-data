Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing the values 10 and `c`, `b` is a list containing the value 100000, `fail` is True, P is a non-empty list, and `c` is the last element in list P. If the length of list `a` is 1, `c` is appended to list `a`. If c is greater than the last element of list `a` and c is also greater than the last element of list `b`, then `fail` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `fail` remains False and there is no change to the variables.***
