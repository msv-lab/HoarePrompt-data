Example Answer:
The value of `c` is appended to list `b`, so after execution, list `b` will contain the values 100000, `c`. Since `c` is also appended to list `a`, list `a` will now contain the values 10, `c`, `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing the values 10, `c`, `c`; `b` is a list containing the values 100000, `c`; `c` is appended to list `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing the values 10, `c`, `c`; `b` is a list containing the values 100000, `c`; `c` is appended to list `a` and `b`**
