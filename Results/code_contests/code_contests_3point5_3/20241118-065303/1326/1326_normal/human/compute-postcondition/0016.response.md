Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing the values 10, `c`, `c`; `b` is a list containing the value 100000; `fail` is True; P is a non-empty list; `c` is the last element in list P. If c > the last element of list a, c is appended to list a and the loop continues. If c is greater than the last element of list a and also greater than the last element of list b, then fail is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, fail remains False and there is no change to the variables.***
