Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing the values 10, `c`, `c`, `c` if `c` is greater than the last element of both lists `a` and `b`. If `c` is only greater than the last element of list `a`, then `c` is appended to list `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `b` but not greater than the last element of list `a`, then `c` is appended to both lists `a` and `b`. If `c` is not greater than the last elements of both lists `a` and `b`, no changes occur to the lists and `fail` remains False.***
