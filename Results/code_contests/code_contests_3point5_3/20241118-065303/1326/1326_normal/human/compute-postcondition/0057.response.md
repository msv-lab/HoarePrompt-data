Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists. If the length of `b` and the last element of `b` are less than the length of `a` and the last element of `a`, `c` is appended to `b`. Otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, `b` is appended with `c`, and `fail` may be set to True, indicating a possible loop break. The state of `b` remains unchanged, `P` still has more elements to iterate. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, the program continues iterating through `P` with the same values of `a`, `b`, `fail`, and other variables.***
