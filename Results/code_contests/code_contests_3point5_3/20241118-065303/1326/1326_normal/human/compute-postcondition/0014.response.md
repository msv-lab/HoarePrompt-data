Example Answer:
The value of `c` is appended to the list `a`, which already contains the values 10 and `c`, where `c` is greater than the last element of `a`. Therefore, after execution, the new list `a` will contain the values 10, `c`, and `c`.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing the values 10, `c`, `c`; `b` is a list containing the value 100000; `fail` is True; P is a non-empty list; `c` is the last element in list P**
