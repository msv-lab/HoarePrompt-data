Postcondition: ***`a` is a list where `c` is appended, if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, `fail` is set to True, and the loop is broken. The state of `b` remains unchanged, `P` still has more elements to iterate. If `c` is not greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, the program continues iterating through `P` with the same values of `a`, `b`, `fail`, and other variables.***
