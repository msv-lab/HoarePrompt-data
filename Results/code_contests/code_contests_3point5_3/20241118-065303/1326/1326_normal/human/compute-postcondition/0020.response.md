Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing the values 10, `c`, `c`; `b` is a list containing the values 100000, `c` if `c` is greater than the last element of list b, then fail is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If c is greater than the last element of list a but not greater than the last element of list b, then c is appended to list a and the loop continues. Otherwise, if c is not greater than the last elements of both lists a and b, fail remains False and there is no change to the variables.***
