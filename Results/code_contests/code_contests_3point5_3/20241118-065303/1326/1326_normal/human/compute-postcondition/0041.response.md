Postcondition: ***`a` is a list. If `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, `fail` is set to True, `c` is appended to the end of `a`, and the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If `c` is not greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, `c` is appended to the end of `b`. The state of the program after the if else block execution covers the scenarios where `c` is greater than, equal to, or less than the last elements of both `a` and `b`, ensuring the appropriate actions are taken in each case.***
