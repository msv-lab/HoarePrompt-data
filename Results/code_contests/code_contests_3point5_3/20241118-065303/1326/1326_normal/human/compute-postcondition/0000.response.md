Example Answer:
The function `func_3()` is called, and it returns a list of 2N integers, which are assigned to variable P. The previous state of variables is not given, so the output state is: **Precondition**: **N is a positive integer representing the length of arrays a and b. P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation. Each integer in P is between 1 and 2N, inclusive.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **N is a positive integer representing the length of arrays a and b. P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation. Each integer in P is between 1 and 2N, inclusive.**
