Example Answer:
The value of `c` is appended to the list `a`, and the value of `c` is the last element in list `P`. The initial value of `a` was [10], and the value of `c` is added to `a`, so the new value of `a` is [10, c]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing the values 10 and `c`, `b` is a list containing the value 100000, `fail` is False, P is a non-empty list, and `c` is the last element in list P.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing the values 10 and `c`, `b` is a list containing the value 100000, `fail` is False, P is a non-empty list, and `c` is the last element in list P**
