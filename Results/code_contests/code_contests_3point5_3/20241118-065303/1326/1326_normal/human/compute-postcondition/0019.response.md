Output State: **`a` is a list containing the values 10, `c`, `c`; `b` is a list containing the values 100000, `c`; `fail` is True; P is a non-empty list; `c` is the last element in list P. If c is greater than the last element of list b, then fail is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, fail remains False.**
