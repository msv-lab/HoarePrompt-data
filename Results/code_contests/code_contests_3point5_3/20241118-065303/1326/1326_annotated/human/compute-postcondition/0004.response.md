According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `P` which is a permutation of length 2n. If P has at least one element, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `P` has at least one element. As the loop is iterating in reverse order (`[::-1]`), we need to set `c` as the last element of `P`.

State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, p is a permutation of length 2n with at least one element, a is a list containing the element 10, b is a list containing the element 10^5, fail is False, c is the last element of P**
