Example Answer:
The function func_3 is called and it returns a value assigned to P. The specific calculations inside the function are not provided, but we know that P is assigned a value based on the execution of func_3. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, p is a permutation of length 2n, where each element p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= 2n, and P is assigned a specific value based on the execution of func_3.
Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, p is a permutation of length 2n, where each element p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= 2n, and P is assigned a specific value based on the execution of func_3**
