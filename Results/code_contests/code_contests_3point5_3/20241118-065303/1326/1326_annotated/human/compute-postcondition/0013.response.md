Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `p` is a permutation of length 2n with at least one element, `a` is a list containing the elements 10 and c, `b` is a list containing the element 10^5, `fail` is True, `c` is the last element of P, and the length of `a` is 2 if len(a) == 1. The program sets `fail` to True if c is greater than the last element of a and c is greater than the last element of b. Additionally, `fail` is set to True after the if condition is true.***
