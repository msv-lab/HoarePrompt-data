Output State: **If the length of list `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to the list `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of both list `a` and list `b`, `fail` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `a` but not list `b`, `c` is appended to list `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `b` but not list `a`, `c` is appended to list `b`. If the length of list `b` and its last element are less than the length of list `a` and its last element, `c` is appended to list `b`. Otherwise, `c` is appended to list `a`.**
