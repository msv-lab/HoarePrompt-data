Postcondition: ***a and b are lists, c is appended to either list a or list b based on the conditions described in the precondition. If c is greater than the last element of both lists a and b, fail is True and the loop breaks. If the length of list a is not equal to N + 1, c is appended to list a or list b based on the comparison of the last elements of both lists.***
