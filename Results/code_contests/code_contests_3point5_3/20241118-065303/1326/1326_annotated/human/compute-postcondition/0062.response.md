Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `c` is an element. If the length of list `a` is not equal to N + 1, then `fail` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the program variables depends on the conditions specified in the precondition. If `c` is greater than the last element of both lists `a` and `b`, `fail` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `a` but not list `b`, `c` is appended to list `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `b` but not list `a`, `c` is appended to list `b`. If the length of list `b` and its last element are less than the length of list `a` and its last element, `c` is appended to list `b`. In all other cases, `c` is appended to list `a`.***
