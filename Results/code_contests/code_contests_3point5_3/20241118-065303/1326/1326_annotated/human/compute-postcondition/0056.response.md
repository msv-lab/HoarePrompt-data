Output State: **`t`, `n`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `fail` are positive integers. If the length of list `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to the list `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of both list `a` and list `b`, `fail` is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `t`, `n`, `p`, `b`, `fail`. In the if part, if `c` is greater than the last element of list `a`, `c` is appended to the list `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `b`, `fail` is set to True. The else part does not result in any changes to the variables stated in the precondition.**
