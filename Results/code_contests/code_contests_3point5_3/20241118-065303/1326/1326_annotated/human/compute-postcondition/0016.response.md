Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `p` is a permutation of length 2n with at least one element, `a` is a list containing the elements 10, c, `b` is a list containing the element 10^5, `fail` is True. If c is greater than the last element of a and c is greater than the last element of b, then fail is set to True. If the if condition is true, c is appended to the list a.***
