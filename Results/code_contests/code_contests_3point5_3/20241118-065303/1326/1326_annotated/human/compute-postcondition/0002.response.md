Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned a new list containing the element 10^5. The previous value of `b` is not relevant as it is being overwritten. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, p is a permutation of length 2n, a is a list containing the element 10, b is a list containing the element 10^5.
Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, p is a permutation of length 2n, a is a list containing the element 10, b is a list containing the element 10^5**
