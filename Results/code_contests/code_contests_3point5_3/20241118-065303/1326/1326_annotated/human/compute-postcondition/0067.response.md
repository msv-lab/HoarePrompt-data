Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `c` is an element. If `fail` is True, then the loop has broken and the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, based on the conditions specified, `c` is appended to either list `a` or list `b` depending on the comparisons with the last elements of the lists and the lengths of the lists. The state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block covers all edge cases: if `c` is greater than the last element of both lists `a` and `b`, `fail` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `a` but not list `b`, `c` is appended to list `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of list `b` but not list `a`, `c` is appended to list `b`. If the length of list `b` and its last element are less than the length of list `a` and its last element, `c` is appended to list `b`. In all other cases, `c` is appended to list `a`.***
