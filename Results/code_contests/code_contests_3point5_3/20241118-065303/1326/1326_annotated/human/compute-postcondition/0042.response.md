For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted based on the given conditions:

1. If the length of `a` is 1 and `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, then `c` should be appended to `a`.
2. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a` but not greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` should be appended to `a`.
3. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, the loop should continue without changing `a`.
4. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` should be appended to `b`.

State: **`t`, `n`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `fail` are positive integers. Adjust `a` and `b` based on the above conditions if necessary.**
