Example Answer:
The value of `c` is appended to the list `a`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: `t`, `n`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `fail` are positive integers, and `c` is appended to the list `a`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `fail` are positive integers, and `c` is appended to the list `a`**
