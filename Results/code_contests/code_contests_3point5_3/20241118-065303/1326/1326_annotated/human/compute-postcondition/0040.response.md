Output State: **`t`, `n`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `fail` are positive integers. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` is appended to `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a` and greater than the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True and the program breaks. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a` but not greater than the last element of `b`, `c` is appended to `a` without changing `fail`. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, the program continues without changing `a` or `fail`. In the case that `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, `c` is appended to `b` without changing `a` or `fail`.**
