Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `fail` are all positive integers. `p` is a permutation of length 2n with at least two elements. `a` is a list containing the elements 10 and `c`, where `c` is greater than the last element of `a`. `b` is a list containing the elements 10^5. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` is appended to `a`, otherwise the program continues without any changes. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a` and also greater than the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True and the program breaks.***
