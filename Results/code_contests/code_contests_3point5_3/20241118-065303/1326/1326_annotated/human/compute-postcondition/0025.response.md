Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `p` is a permutation of length 2n with at least one element, `a` is a list containing the elements 10, c is greater than the last element of a, `b` is a list containing the elements 10^5, `fail` is True. If c is greater than the last element of a and c is greater than the last element of b, then fail is set to True. If c is greater than the last element of b, c is appended to the list b. If the length of list b and its last element are less than the length of list a and its last element, then c is appended to list b. Otherwise, c is appended to list a.***
