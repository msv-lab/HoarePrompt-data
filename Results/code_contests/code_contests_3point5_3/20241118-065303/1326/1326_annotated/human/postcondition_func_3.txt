The function `func_4` accepts a positive integer parameter `N` within the range 1 <= N <= 1000. It initializes lists `a` and `b`, performs a series of comparisons and appends elements accordingly. If the length of list `a` is not equal to N + 1, it sets `fail` to True. Based on the comparisons, if `fail` is True, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not have a specified output or return value.
