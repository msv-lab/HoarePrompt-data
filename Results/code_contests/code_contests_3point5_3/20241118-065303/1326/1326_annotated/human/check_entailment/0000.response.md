Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It handles the cases where two arrays are merged based on the given conditions. The program iterates through the permutation array `P` in reverse order, determining whether to append the current element to array `a` or array `b` based on comparisons with the last elements of the arrays. The final output is determined based on whether the merging process was successful or not. The logic of the program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, and there are no identified edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output.
