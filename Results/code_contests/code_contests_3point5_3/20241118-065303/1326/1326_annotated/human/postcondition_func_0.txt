The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the value of `s` to the standard error stream. The annotations mention using `sys.stderr.write`, but the necessary import statement for the `sys` module is missing in the code. This means the code will raise a NameError if executed as it is. The current implementation does not align with the provided annotations.
