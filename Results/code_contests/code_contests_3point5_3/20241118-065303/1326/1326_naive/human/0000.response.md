Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exist two arrays a and b, each of length n and with no common elements, such that a permutation p can be merged from a and b. The program iterates through the permutation in reverse order and appropriately assigns elements to arrays a and b based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description. The program outputs "YES" if the merging is successful and "NO" otherwise. The implementation seems to cover all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description.
