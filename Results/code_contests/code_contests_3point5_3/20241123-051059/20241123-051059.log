DEBUG - description: Dawid has four bags of candies. The i-th of them contains a_i candies. Also, Dawid has two friends. He wants to give each bag to one of his two friends. Is it possible to distribute the bags in such a way that each friend receives the same amount of candies in total?

Note, that you can't keep bags for yourself or throw them away, each bag should be given to one of the friends.

Input

The only line contains four integers a_1, a_2, a_3 and a_4 (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the numbers of candies in each bag.

Output

Output YES if it's possible to give the bags to Dawid's friends so that both friends receive the same amount of candies, or NO otherwise. Each character can be printed in any case (either uppercase or lowercase).

Examples

Input


1 7 11 5


Output


YES


Input


7 3 2 5


Output


NO

Note

In the first sample test, Dawid can give the first and the third bag to the first friend, and the second and the fourth bag to the second friend. This way, each friend will receive 12 candies.

In the second sample test, it's impossible to distribute the bags.

DEBUG - description: While resting on the ship after the "Russian Code Cup" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of size n × m, consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.

Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed 108.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the size of the table. 

Output

Print the table that meets the condition: n lines containing m integers, separated by spaces. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print anyone. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct answer.

DEBUG - description: Consider the following equation: 

<image> where sign [a] represents the integer part of number a.

Let's find all integer z (z > 0), for which this equation is unsolvable in positive integers. The phrase "unsolvable in positive integers" means that there are no such positive integers x and y (x, y > 0), for which the given above equation holds.

Let's write out all such z in the increasing order: z1, z2, z3, and so on (zi < zi + 1). Your task is: given the number n, find the number zn.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 40).

Output

Print a single integer — the number zn modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

DEBUG - description: Firecrackers scare Nian the monster, but they're wayyyyy too noisy! Maybe fireworks make a nice complement.

Little Tommy is watching a firework show. As circular shapes spread across the sky, a splendid view unfolds on the night of Lunar New Year's eve.

A wonder strikes Tommy. How many regions are formed by the circles on the sky? We consider the sky as a flat plane. A region is a connected part of the plane with positive area, whose bound consists of parts of bounds of the circles and is a curve or several curves without self-intersections, and that does not contain any curve other than its boundaries. Note that exactly one of the regions extends infinitely.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), denoting the number of circles.

The following n lines each contains three space-separated integers x, y and r ( - 10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10, 1 ≤ r ≤ 10), describing a circle whose center is (x, y) and the radius is r. No two circles have the same x, y and r at the same time.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of regions on the plane.
