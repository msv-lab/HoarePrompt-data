Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly checks if it's possible to distribute the candies in such a way that both friends receive the same amount of candies. It sorts the input data and then checks if the sum of the smallest and largest numbers is equal to the sum of the two middle numbers or if the sum of the three smallest numbers is equal to the largest number. This logic covers all possible cases and correctly determines if it's possible to distribute the candies evenly among Dawid's friends.
