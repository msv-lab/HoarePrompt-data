Example Answer:
The input `alphabet` is split into a list of strings and assigned to `data`. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` representing the number of candies in each bag are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 remain as integers representing the number of candies in each bag.
Output State: **a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 remain as integers representing the number of candies in each bag**
