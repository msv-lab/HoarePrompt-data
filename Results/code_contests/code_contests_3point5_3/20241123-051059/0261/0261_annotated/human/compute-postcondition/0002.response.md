Example Answer:
Each element `i` in the list `data` is converted to an integer using `int(i)`, so the list `data` now contains integers. The initial state variables `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` remain as integers representing the number of candies in each bag.
Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` remain as integers representing the number of candies in each bag**
