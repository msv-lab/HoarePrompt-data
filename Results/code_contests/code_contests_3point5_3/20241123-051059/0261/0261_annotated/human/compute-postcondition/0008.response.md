Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are integers representing the number of candies in each bag; `data` is sorted in ascending order. If the sum of the first and last elements of `data` is equal to the sum of the middle two elements of `data`, or the sum of the first three elements of `data` is equal to the last element of `data`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. In all cases, the values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
