Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user representing the number of candies in each bag, sorts the data, and then checks if either the sum of the first and last elements is equal to the sum of the middle two elements, or if the sum of the first three elements is equal to the last element. It then prints 'YES' if either condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters, and each bag's candy count is between 1 and 100.**
