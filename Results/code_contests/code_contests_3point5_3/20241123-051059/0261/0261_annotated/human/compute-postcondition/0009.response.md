The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Inside the function, there are four integer variables `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4`, representing the number of candies in each bag. Each variable is constrained such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function does not return any value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It declares four integer variables representing the number of candies in each bag, with each variable constrained to be between 1 and 100.**
