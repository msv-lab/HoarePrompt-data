Example Answer:
The `data` list is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are not provided, so the output state is: `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` remain as integers representing the number of candies in each bag, and `data` is sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` remain as integers representing the number of candies in each bag; `data` is sorted in ascending order**
