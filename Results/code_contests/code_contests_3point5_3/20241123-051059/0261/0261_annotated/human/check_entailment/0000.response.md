Correctness: **True**

The program takes in the number of candies in each bag, sorts them in ascending order, and then checks if it is possible to distribute the bags in such a way that both friends receive the same amount of candies. If the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted list is equal to the sum of the middle two elements, or the sum of the first three elements is equal to the last element, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

The logic of the program is correct and covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The program is handling all edge cases and correctly determines whether it is possible to distribute the bags in the required manner.
