The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes into consideration four variables, a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4, which represent the number of candies in each bag. Each variable is an integer where 1 <= a_i <= 100. The function does not return any value, but it performs certain operations or checks based on the values of a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4.
