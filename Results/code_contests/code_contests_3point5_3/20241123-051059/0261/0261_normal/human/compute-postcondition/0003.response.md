Example Answer:
The `data` list is sorted in ascending order. The initial values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values in the sorted list. Therefore, the Output State is: Each element in the list `data` is an integer representing the number of candies in each bag, sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **Each element in the list `data` is an integer representing the number of candies in each bag, sorted in ascending order**
