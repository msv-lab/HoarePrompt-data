Example Answer:
`data` is assigned the result of splitting the string `alphabet`. Since the initial state does not mention `alphabet`, we cannot determine the values of `data`. Therefore, the output state is: a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4 are integers representing the number of candies in each bag, where 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each i.
Output State: **a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4 are integers representing the number of candies in each bag, where 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each i**
