Example Answer:
Each element in the list `data` is converted to an integer using list comprehension. The initial values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers representing the number of candies in each bag. After execution, the values in the list `data` will be integers based on the previous values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4`.
Output State: **Each element in the list `data` is an integer representing the number of candies in each bag based on the initial values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4**.
