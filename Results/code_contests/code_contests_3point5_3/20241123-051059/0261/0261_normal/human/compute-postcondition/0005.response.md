Example Answer: 
The code `print('YES')` does not affect the state of the program or any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Each element in the list `data` is an integer representing the number of candies in each bag, sorted in ascending order. The sum of the first and fourth elements in `data` is equal to the sum of the second and third elements in `data`, or the sum of the first, second, and third elements in `data` is equal to the fourth element.**
