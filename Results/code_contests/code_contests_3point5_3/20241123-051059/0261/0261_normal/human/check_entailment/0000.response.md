Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input from the user, splits it into a list of integers, sorts the integers in ascending order, and then checks if the sum of the first and fourth elements is equal to the sum of the second and third elements, or if the sum of the first, second, and third elements is equal to the fourth element. 
- The program then prints 'YES' if either of these conditions is met, indicating that it is possible to distribute the bags so that both friends receive the same amount of candies. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
