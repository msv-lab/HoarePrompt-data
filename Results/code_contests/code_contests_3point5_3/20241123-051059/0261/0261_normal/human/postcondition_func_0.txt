The function `func` reads input from the user, splits it into a list of integers, sorts the integers in ascending order, and then checks if the sum of the first and fourth elements is equal to the sum of the second and third elements, or if the sum of the first, second, and third elements is equal to the fourth element. Depending on the condition, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input for data processing.
