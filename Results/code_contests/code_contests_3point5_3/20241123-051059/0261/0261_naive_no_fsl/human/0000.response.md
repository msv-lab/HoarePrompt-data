Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It only checks for two specific cases where the bags can be distributed equally among the two friends. However, it does not consider all possible cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 2 3 4
```
According to the problem description, it should be possible to distribute the bags in such a way that each friend receives the same amount of candies. But the program will output 'NO' for this input, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
