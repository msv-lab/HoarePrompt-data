Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input, processes the list to determine the frequencies of each integer, calculates the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet, and prints the result. 
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output based on the examples given in the problem description. 
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality and do not suggest any cases that the code does not cover. 
- Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
