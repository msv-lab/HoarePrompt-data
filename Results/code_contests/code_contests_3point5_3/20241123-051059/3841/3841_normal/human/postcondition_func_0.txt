The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then processes the list to determine the frequency of each integer and calculates a specific value `ans` based on the frequencies and visitation status of the elements in the list. Finally, it prints the calculated `ans`. The function assumes `n` is a positive integer and the list `arr` contains integers between 1 and 10^5.
