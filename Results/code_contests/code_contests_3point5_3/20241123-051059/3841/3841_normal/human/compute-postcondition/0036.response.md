Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5. freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 1 for the element i in arr, rem is the number of unique elements in arr. ans is increased by rem if not vis[i] for all elements in arr, and the frequency of each element i in freq is decreased by 1 if not freq[i]. If not freq[i], rem is decreased by 1.***
