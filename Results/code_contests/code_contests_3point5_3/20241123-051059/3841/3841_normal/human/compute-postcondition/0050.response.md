The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the precondition that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the row, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^5. The function performs a specific operation on the elements of the list `arr` and returns a certain output based on the operation.
