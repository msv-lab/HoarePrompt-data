Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 1 for the element `i` in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, and `ans` is increased by `rem` if `vis[i]` is False for all elements in `arr`, and the frequency of each element `i` in `freq` is decreased by 1 if `freq[i]` is False. If `freq[i]` is False, `rem` is decreased by 1.***
