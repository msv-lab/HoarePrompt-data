Output State: 
The loop iterates through the elements in the list `arr`, updating the dictionaries `freq` and `vis`. For each element `i`, the loop increments the frequency count in `freq[i]` and sets the corresponding visibility in `vis[i]` to 0 if the frequency was previously 0. The loop will execute at least once if `arr` has at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `freq` and `vis` dictionaries remain empty. The values in `freq` represent the frequency of each element in `arr`, while the values in `vis` represent the visibility status of each element in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5. `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element `i` in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 0 for each element `i` in `arr. If arr is empty, freq and vis remain empty dictionaries.**
