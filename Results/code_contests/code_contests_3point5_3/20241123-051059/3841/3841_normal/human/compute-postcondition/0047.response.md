According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `arr` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequencies, `vis` is a dictionary with updated visitation status, and `rem` is decreased by 1 if the frequency of the current element `i` becomes zero. If the visitation status of element `i` is false, then `ans` is increased by the value of `rem`, and the visitation status of `i` is set to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that there are still elements left in the `arr` list to iterate over. Therefore, `n` needs to be a positive integer greater than the current index `i`, and `arr` needs to contain at least `i+1` elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5 with at least `i+1` elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequencies, `vis` is a dictionary with updated visitation status, and `rem` is decreased by 1 if the frequency of the current element `i` becomes zero**
