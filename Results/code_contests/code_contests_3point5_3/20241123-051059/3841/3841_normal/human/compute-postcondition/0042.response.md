Example Answer:
The value of `rem` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `rem` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequencies, `vis` is a dictionary with updated visitation status, and `rem` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequencies, `vis` is a dictionary with updated visitation status, and `rem` is decreased by 1**
