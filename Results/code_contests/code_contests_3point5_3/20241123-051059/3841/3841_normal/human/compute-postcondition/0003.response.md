Example Answer:
`vis` is assigned an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the row, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the row, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
