Example Answer:
The code snippet `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` assigns the value of `freq.get(i, 0)` to `freq[i]`. If the key `i` is present in the dictionary `freq`, then the value associated with key `i` is returned, otherwise, the default value of 0 is returned. Since the key `i` is already initialized to 1 for each element in `arr`, the value of `freq[i]` remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in arr is between 1 and 10^5, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 0 for each element i in arr, index of the next element in arr to be processed is further incremented, freq[i] is further increased by 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in arr is between 1 and 10^5, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 0 for each element i in arr, index of the next element in arr to be processed is further incremented, freq[i] is further increased by 1**
