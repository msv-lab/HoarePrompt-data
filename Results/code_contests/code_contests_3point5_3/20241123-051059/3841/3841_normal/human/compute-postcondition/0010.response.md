According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the list `arr` that have not been processed yet. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element `i` in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 0 for each element `i` in `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the list `arr` needs to be processed. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the index of the next element to be processed in the list `arr`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element `i` in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 0 for each element `i` in `arr`, index of the next element in `arr` to be processed is incremented**
