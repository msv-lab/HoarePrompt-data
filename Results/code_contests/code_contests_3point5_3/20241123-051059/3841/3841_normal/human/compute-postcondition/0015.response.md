According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the next element in `arr` is to be processed, meaning the loop will execute again. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- The index of the next element in `arr` to be processed should be incremented.
- The frequency of the current element `i` in `freq` should be increased by 1.

State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in arr is between 1 and 10^5, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 0 for each element i in arr, index of the next element in arr to be processed is further incremented, freq[i] is further increased by 1**
