Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequencies, `vis` is a dictionary with updated visitation status, and `rem` is decreased by 1 if the frequency of the current element `i` becomes zero. All variables retain their initial properties, with `rem` being reduced by 1 if `freq[i]` evaluates to false. The dictionaries `freq` and `vis` are updated accordingly based on the visitation status of the current element `i`.***
