Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in arr is between 1 and 10^5. freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 0 for each element i in arr. The index of the next element in arr to be processed is further incremented, and freq[i] is further increased by 1. If freq[i] is 0, then vis[i] is set to 0. All initial conditions and increments remain intact after the execution of the if statement.***
