Example Answer: 
The value of `vis[i]` is reset to 0. This means that the visit status of element `i` is reset to unvisited. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in arr is between 1 and 10^5, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 0 for each element i in arr, index of the next element in arr to be processed is further incremented, freq[i] is further increased by 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in arr is between 1 and 10^5, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 0 for each element i in arr, index of the next element in arr to be processed is further incremented, freq[i] is further increased by 1**
