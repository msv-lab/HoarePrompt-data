Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `rem`. The previous values of `ans` and `rem` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 1 for the element `i` in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 1 for the element `i` in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, and `ans` is increased by `rem`**
