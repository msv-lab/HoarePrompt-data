Example Answer: 
The code snippet `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` checks if the key `i` exists in the dictionary `freq`. If it does, it returns the value associated with the key `i`, otherwise it returns 0. Since `freq` is an empty dictionary initially, the value of `freq[i]` will be set to 0 for any key `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 0, `vis` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 0, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
