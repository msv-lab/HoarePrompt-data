According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements left in the list `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in arr is between 1 and 10^5, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 0 for each element i in arr. The index of the next element in arr to be processed is further incremented, and freq[i] is further increased by 1. If freq[i] is 0, then vis[i] is set to 0.

To execute the loop one more time, the index of the next element in arr to be processed should point to the next element in the list. Therefore, the index needs to be incremented. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in arr is between 1 and 10^5, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 0 for each element i in arr. The index of the next element in arr to be processed is further incremented, and freq[i] is further increased by 1. If freq[i] is 0, then vis[i] is set to 0. The index of the next element in arr to be processed is adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.**
