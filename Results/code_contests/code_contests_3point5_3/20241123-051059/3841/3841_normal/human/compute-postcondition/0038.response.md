Example Answer:
The value of `vis[i]` is assigned to 1, where `i` is an element in `arr`. This assignment ensures that the element `i` is visited. The states of `n`, `arr`, `freq`, `vis`, `rem`, and `ans` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 1 for the element `i` in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 1 for the element `i` in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, and `ans` is increased by `rem`**
