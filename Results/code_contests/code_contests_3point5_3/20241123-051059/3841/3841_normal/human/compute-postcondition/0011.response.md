Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `freq[i]` to either the current value of `freq[i]` if `i` is already a key in the dictionary `freq`, or to 0 if `i` is not a key in the dictionary. Since `i` is an element in `arr`, and `freq` is initialized with keys set to 1 for each element in `arr`, this operation simply keeps the value of `freq[i]` the same if it already exists in the dictionary. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element `i` in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 0 for each element `i` in `arr`, index of the next element in `arr` to be processed is incremented.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element `i` in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 0 for each element `i` in `arr`, index of the next element in `arr` to be processed is incremented**
