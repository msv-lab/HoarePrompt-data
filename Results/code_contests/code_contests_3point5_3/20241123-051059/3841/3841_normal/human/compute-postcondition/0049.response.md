Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5. `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequencies for each element in `arr`. `vis` is a dictionary with updated visitation status for each element in `arr`. `rem` is decreased by 1 if the frequency of the current element `i` becomes zero. If the visitation status of element `i` is false, then `ans` is increased by the value of `rem`, and the visitation status of `i` is set to 1. If `arr` is empty, `freq` and `vis` remain empty dictionaries. 
If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values.**
