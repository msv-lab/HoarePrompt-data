Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequencies, `vis` is a dictionary with updated visitation status, and `rem` is decreased by 1 if the frequency of the current element `i` becomes zero. If the visitation status of element `i` is false, then `ans` is increased by the value of `rem`, and the visitation status of `i` is set to 1.***
