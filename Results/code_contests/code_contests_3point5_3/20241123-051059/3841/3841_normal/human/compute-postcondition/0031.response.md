Example Answer: 
The element i in arr is marked as visited by setting vis[i] to 1. The state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 1 for the element i in arr, rem is the number of unique elements in arr, ans is increased by rem, and the frequency of element i in freq is decreased by 1 if not freq[i]. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers, freq is a dictionary with keys initialized to 1 for each element i in arr, vis is a dictionary with key i initialized to 1 for the element i in arr, rem is the number of unique elements in arr, ans is increased by rem, and the frequency of element i in freq is decreased by 1 if not freq[i]**
