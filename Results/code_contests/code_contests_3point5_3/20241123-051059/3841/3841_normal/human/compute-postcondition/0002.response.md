Example Answer:
The `freq` dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the row, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the row, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is an empty dictionary**
