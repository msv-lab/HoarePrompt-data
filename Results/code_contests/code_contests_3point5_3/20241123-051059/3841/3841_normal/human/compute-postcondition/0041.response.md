Example Answer:
The frequency of element `i` in the dictionary `freq` is decremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are known. Therefore, after execution, the state is as follows:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^5, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequencies, `vis` is a dictionary with updated visitation status, `rem` is decreased if the frequency of the current element `i` becomes zero.**
