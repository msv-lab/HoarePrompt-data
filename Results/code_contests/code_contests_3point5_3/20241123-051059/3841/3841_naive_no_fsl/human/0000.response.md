Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input, stores the frequency of each number in the list, and keeps track of visited numbers.
2. It iterates through the list of numbers, updates the frequency count, and checks if the number has been visited before.
3. It calculates the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to the robots so that they will not meet based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
4. The program logic aligns with the problem requirements and handles all potential cases correctly.
5. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct output based on the problem description.
