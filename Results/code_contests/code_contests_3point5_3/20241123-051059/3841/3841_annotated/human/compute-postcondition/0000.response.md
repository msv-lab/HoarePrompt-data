Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^5].
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^5]**
