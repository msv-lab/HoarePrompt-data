According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `arr` list. If there are still elements in the list, the loop will continue. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `freq[i]` is not zero, no changes occur.
- If `freq[i]` is zero, then `freq[i]` is decremented by 1.
- `rem` is updated.
- `ans` is incremented by the updated value of `rem`.
- `vis[i]` is set to 1.

Additionally, if `vis[i]` is False, the program increments `ans` by `rem` and sets `vis[i]` to 1.

State: **Output State: freq[i] is decremented by 1, rem is updated, ans is incremented by the updated value of rem, vis[i] is set to 1.**
