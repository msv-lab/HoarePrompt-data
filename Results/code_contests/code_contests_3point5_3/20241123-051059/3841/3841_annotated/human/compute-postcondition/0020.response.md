According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements remaining in the `arr` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element. The dictionary `freq` has key `i` with a value increased by 1 for the next element in `arr`, and `vis` has key `i` set to 0 if `freq` at index `i` was falsy for the next element in `arr`. The index `i` is the index of the next element in `arr`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. Increase the value of `i` by 1 to point to the next element in `arr`.
2. Update the value in `freq` at index `i` to be increased by 1 for the next element in `arr`.
3. If `freq` at index `i` is falsy, set `vis` at index `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, dictionary `freq` has key `i` with a value increased by 1 for the next element in `arr`, and `vis` has key `i` set to 0 if `freq` at index `i` was falsy for the next element in `arr`, with `i` pointing to the next element in `arr`.**
