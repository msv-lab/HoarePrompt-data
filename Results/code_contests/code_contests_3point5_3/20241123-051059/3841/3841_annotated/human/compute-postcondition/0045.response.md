Example Answer: 
The value of `vis[i]` is assigned 1. There is no mention of `ans` or `rem` in the code snippet provided, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is incremented by the value of `rem`, `vis[i]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`ans` is incremented by the value of `rem`, `vis[i]` is assigned 1**
