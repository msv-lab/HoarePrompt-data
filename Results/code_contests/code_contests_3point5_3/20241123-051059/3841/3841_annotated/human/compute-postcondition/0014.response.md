Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` dictionary has key `i` with value increased by 1 for the next element in `arr`, `vis` dictionary has key `i` set to 0 if freq at index `i` was falsy for the next element in `arr`, `i` is the index of the next element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is updated to the value of `freq` at index `i` or 0 if the key `i` does not exist. If freq at index `i` is falsy, vis at index `i` is set to 0.**
