Example Answer: 
`freq[i]` is assigned the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`, which retrieves the value of key `i` from the dictionary `freq` if it exists, otherwise it returns 0. Since `freq` is an empty dictionary and `i` is 0, the value assigned to `freq[0]` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with key 0 and value 0, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with key 0 and value 0, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0**
