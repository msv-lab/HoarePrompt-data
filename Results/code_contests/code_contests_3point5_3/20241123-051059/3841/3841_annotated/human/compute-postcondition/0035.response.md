Example Answer:
The value of `rem` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `rem` is unknown, so after execution, `rem` is updated by decrementing 1. The value of `freq[i]` is not specified, so it is not possible to determine the exact value of `rem`. The state of `ans` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: freq[i] is decremented by 1, rem is updated, and ans remains the same.
Output State: **freq[i] is decremented by 1, rem is updated, and ans remains the same**
