Example Answer:
The code calculates the number of unique elements in the list `arr` by converting it to a set and then getting its length. The variable `rem` is assigned this value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute. After the loop executes, `freq` dictionary has keys representing unique elements in `arr` with their respective frequencies, `vis` dictionary has keys representing elements in `arr` with their visibility set to 0 if their frequency was 0, and `i` is the last element in `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: If arr is an empty list, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, freq dictionary has keys representing unique elements in arr with their respective frequencies, vis dictionary has keys representing elements in arr with their visibility set to 0 if their frequency was 0, and i is the last element in arr; rem is the number of unique elements in arr.
Output State: **If arr is an empty list, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, freq dictionary has keys representing unique elements in arr with their respective frequencies, vis dictionary has keys representing elements in arr with their visibility set to 0 if their frequency was 0, and i is the last element in arr; rem is the number of unique elements in arr.**
