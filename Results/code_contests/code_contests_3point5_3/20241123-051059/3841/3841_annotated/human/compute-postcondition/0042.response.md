Example Answer:
The value of `rem` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `rem` is unknown, so after execution, the updated value of `rem` is decremented by 1. The variable `ans` is then incremented by the updated value of `rem`. The variable `vis[i]` is set to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: freq[i] is decremented by 1, rem is updated, ans is incremented by the updated value of rem, vis[i] is set to 1.
Output State: **freq[i] is decremented by 1, rem is updated, ans is incremented by the updated value of rem, vis[i] is set to 1**
