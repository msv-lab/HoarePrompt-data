The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on predefined variables `n` and `arr`, which must adhere to the specified constraints. The function calculates and returns the sum of all integers in the list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the sum of all integers in the list `arr`, where `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^5].**
