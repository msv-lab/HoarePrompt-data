According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list `arr`. Since `arr` has `n` elements, the loop will execute `n` times. In each iteration, the loop will access the element at index `i` in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` should have at least one element (i.e., `n` is greater than 0), and the loop should start with the first element in `arr`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0**
