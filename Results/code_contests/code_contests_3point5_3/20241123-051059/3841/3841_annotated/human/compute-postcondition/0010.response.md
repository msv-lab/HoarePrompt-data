According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` still has elements left, `freq` dictionary has key `i` with value increased by 1 for the last element processed, `vis` dictionary has key `i` set to 0 if freq at index `i` was falsy, and `i` is the index of the last element processed. For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` needs to be adjusted to the next index in the list `arr`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` dictionary has key `i` with value increased by 1 for the next element in `arr`, `vis` dictionary has key `i` set to 0 if freq at index `i` was falsy for the next element in `arr`, `i` is the index of the next element in `arr`**
