Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with key 0 and value 0, `vis` is a dictionary with key 0 and value 0, `i` is 0. If the value of freq at index `i` is falsy (0), then vis at index `i` is set to 0. If the value of freq at index `i` is truthy, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
