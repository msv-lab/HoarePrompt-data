Example Answer:
`vis` is assigned the value `dict()`, which creates an empty dictionary. The other variables `n`, `arr`, and `freq` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^5], `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^5], `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
