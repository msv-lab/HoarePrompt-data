Example Answer: 
The element at index `i` in the list `vis` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of variables `vis`, `ans`, and `rem` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is incremented by an unknown value of `rem`; the element at index `i` in the list `vis` is `1`.
Output State: **`ans` is incremented by an unknown value of `rem`; the element at index `i` in the list `vis` is `1`**
