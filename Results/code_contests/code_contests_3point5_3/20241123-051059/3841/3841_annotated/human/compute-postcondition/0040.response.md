According to the given code, the loop will iterate over the elements in the array `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. If freq[i] is decremented by 1, rem should be updated (decreased by 1 if freq[i] becomes 0 or if not vis[i]).
2. ans should be incremented by the updated value of rem.
3. If not freq[i], then freq[i] should be decremented by 1, rem should be updated, and ans should remain the same.
4. If not vis[i], ans should be incremented by the updated value of rem, and vis[i] should be set to 1.

State: **Output State: freq[i] is decremented by 1, rem is updated, ans is incremented by the updated value of rem, vis[i] is set to 1**
