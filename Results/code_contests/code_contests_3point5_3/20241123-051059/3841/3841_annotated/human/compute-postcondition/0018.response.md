Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element. The dictionary `freq` has key `i` with a value increased by 1 for the next element in `arr`, and `vis` has key `i` set to 0 if `freq` at index `i` was falsy for the next element in `arr`. The index `i` is the index of the next element in `arr`. If `freq` at index `i` is falsy, `vis` at index `i` is set to 0.***
