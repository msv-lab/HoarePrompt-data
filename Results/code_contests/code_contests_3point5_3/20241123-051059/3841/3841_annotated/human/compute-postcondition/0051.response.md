Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the user, then reads a list of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the sum of integers in the list `arr`. The function keeps track of the frequency of each unique element in the list and updates the visibility of elements accordingly. Finally, it prints the sum of a certain computation based on the elements in `arr`.**
