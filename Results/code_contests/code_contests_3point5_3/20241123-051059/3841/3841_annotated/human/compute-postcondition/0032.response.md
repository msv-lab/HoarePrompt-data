Postcondition: ***If arr is not empty, freq dictionary has keys representing unique elements in arr with their respective frequencies, vis dictionary has keys representing elements in arr with their visibility set to 1 if their frequency was 0, i is the last element in arr, rem is the number of unique elements in arr decreased by 1. Before the execution of the if statement, freq[i] is decremented by 1. After the if statement, if the frequency of i becomes 0, then rem is decreased by 1. All other variables and dictionaries retain their initial values and relationships. If not vis[i], then the frequency of i becomes 0 and rem is decreased by 1. Finally, ans is incremented by the updated value of rem.***
