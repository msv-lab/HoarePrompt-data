The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `v`, which is a tuple containing information about a circle. The tuple `v` consists of three integers `x`, `y`, and `r`, where `x` and `y` represent the center coordinates of the circle and `r` represents the radius of the circle. The function returns the parent circle of the circle described by the input tuple `v`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `v` containing information about a circle and returns the parent circle of the circle described by `v`.**
