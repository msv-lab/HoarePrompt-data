Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `v` and `u`. It assigns the result of calling `func_2(v)` to the key indexed by the result of calling `func_2(u)` in the `par` dictionary. No specific return value is mentioned.** 

It's important to note that the annotations mention preconditions related to circle descriptions and positive integers, but the actual code does not reflect these conditions. Additionally, the code snippet lacks context on the purpose or implications of updating values in the `par` dictionary.
