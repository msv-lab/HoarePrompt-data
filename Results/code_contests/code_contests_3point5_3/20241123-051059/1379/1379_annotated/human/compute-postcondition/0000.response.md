Example Answer:
The value of `v` is passed into `func_2`, and the result is assigned to `par` at the index returned by `func_2(u)`. The previous values of `par` and `u` are unknown, so the output state is: Precondition: n is a positive integer. Each circle is described by three integers x, y, and r where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values at the same time.
Output State: **Precondition: n is a positive integer. Each circle is described by three integers x, y, and r where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values at the same time.**
