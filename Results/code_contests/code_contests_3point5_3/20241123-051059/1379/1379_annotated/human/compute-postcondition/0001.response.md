The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `v` and `u`. **Precondition**: `n` is a positive integer. Each circle is described by three integers `x`, `y`, and `r` where -10 <= `x`, `y` <= 10 and 1 <= `r` <= 10. No two circles have the same `x`, `y`, and `r` values at the same time. 
The function does not have any specific return value mentioned.
