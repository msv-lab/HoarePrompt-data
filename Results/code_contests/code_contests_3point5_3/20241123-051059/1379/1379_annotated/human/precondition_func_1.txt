**Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3. Each of the following n lines contains three space-separated integers x, y, and r, where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10, describing the center coordinates and radius of a circle. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values simultaneously.**
