The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `v`. **Precondition**: `v` is a positive integer. Each circle is described by three integers x, y, and r where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10. No two circles have the same x, y, and r at the same time. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of par[v]. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `v` and return the value of par[v].
