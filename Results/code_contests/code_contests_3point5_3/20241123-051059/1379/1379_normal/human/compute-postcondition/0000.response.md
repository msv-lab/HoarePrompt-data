Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with the value of `v`, and the return value is assigned to the dictionary `par` at the key `func_2(u)`. The values of `u` and `v` are not specified in the initial state, so the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: **No specific output state can be determined due to lack of initial values for u and v**. 

Output State: **No specific output state can be determined due to lack of initial values for u and v**.
