The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `A` and `B`. The function calculates the difference between `A` and `B`, rotates it, and then returns a line passing through the point `(d.x, d.y)` with a slope of `d * A`. However, the code provided contains a syntax error as the method `rot()` is not a built-in method for calculating the rotation of a vector in Python. Therefore, the functionality is limited by the incorrect usage of the `rot()` method.
