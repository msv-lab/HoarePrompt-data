The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `v`. Each circle is represented by three integers x, y, and r where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10, and no two circles have the same x, y, and r simultaneously. The function recursively updates the value of par[v] by calling `func_2` on par[v] if par[v] is not equal to v. After the execution, the function returns the final value of par[v].
