Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the equation described in the problem. It uses the provided list of values 'a' and calculates the result based on the formula pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7). Since the equation is mathematically calculated, there are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem description that would cause the program to fail. Hence, the program is correct for all potential cases.
