Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned a list of prime numbers. The list contains a total of 40 prime numbers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 40; `a` is a list of 40 prime numbers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 40; `a` is a list of 40 prime numbers**
