Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number zn based on the given equation. It uses a pre-defined list of values for 'a' and then calculates the result using the formula provided in the problem description. The program uses the pow() function to efficiently calculate the power and then performs the necessary modulo operations to get the final result. The program follows the problem description for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
