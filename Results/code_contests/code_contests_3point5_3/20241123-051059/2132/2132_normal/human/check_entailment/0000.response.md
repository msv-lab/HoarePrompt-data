Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not align with the problem description for all potential cases. The equation mentioned in the problem description is not correctly implemented in the code. The code does not handle the equation as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the output hints do not match the code execution. The output hints mention a function called `func` which is not present in the code. 

Therefore, based on the discrepancies between the code, the problem description, and the output hints, the correctness of the code is deemed false.
