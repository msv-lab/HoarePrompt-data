Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100 and x is not equal to 1. If x == 2, the program returns the list [3, 4]. If x % 2 == 1, the program returns a list consisting of x/2 + 1, 2, and x-2 number of 1's. If x % 2 != 1, the program returns a list with x/2 - 1 repetitions of the number 1 followed by x - 1 repetitions of the number 1. The program accounts for all possible edge cases and correctly handles the conditions specified.***
