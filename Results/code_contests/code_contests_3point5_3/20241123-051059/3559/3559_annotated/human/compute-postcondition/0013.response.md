The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is a positive integer. The function also ensures that 1 <= n, m <= 100. 

Based on the conditions specified:
- If x == 1, the program returns a list containing the integer 1.
- If x == 2, the program returns the list [3, 4].
- If x % 2 == 1, the program returns a list consisting of x/2 + 1, 2, and x-2 number of 1's.
- If x % 2 != 1, the program returns a list with x/2 - 1 repetitions of the number 1 followed by x - 1 repetitions of the number 1.

The program correctly handles all possible edge cases and returns the expected output based on these conditions. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `x`, ensuring 1 <= n, m <= 100, and return a list based on the specified conditions for different values of `x`.
