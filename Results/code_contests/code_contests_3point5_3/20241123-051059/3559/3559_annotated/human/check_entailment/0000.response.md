Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. It returns a table of size n x m where the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is a square. The program ensures that each number in the table does not exceed 10^8. The logic implemented in the program covers all scenarios and edge cases, providing the expected output for all valid inputs.
