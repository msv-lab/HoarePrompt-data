The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a positive integer. After executing the function body, if `x` is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1. If `x` is equal to 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is odd, the function returns a list containing x/2 + 1 followed by 2 and then x-2 occurrences of the number 1. If `x` is even, the function returns a list containing x/2 - 1 followed by x-1 occurrences of the number 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `x` and return a list based on the conditions described above. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer x and returns a list based on specific conditions depending on the value of x.**
