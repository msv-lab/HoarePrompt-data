Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a positive integer x and returns a list based on specific conditions depending on the value of x. If x is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1. If x is equal to 2, it returns the list [3, 4]. If x is odd, the function returns a list containing x/2 + 1 followed by 2 and then x-2 occurrences of the number 1. If x is even, it returns a list containing x/2 - 1 followed by x-1 occurrences of the number 1.**
