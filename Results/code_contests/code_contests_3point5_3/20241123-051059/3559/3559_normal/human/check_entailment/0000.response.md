Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not completely follow the problem description. Although the output hints describe the logic behind the `func_1` function, the code itself does not generate a table with values that satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem description. The code simply prints the product of the values returned by the `func_1` function for each row and column, without ensuring that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is a square. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
