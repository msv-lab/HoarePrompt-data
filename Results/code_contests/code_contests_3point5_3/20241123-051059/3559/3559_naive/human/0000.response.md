Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to generate a table that meets the given condition. 
- For n = 1, it returns [1] which satisfies the condition.
- For m = 2, it returns [3, 4] which also satisfies the condition.
- For odd values of n, it generates the table with the sum of squares being a square for each row and column.
- For even values of n, it also generates the table with the sum of squares being a square for each row and column.

Therefore, the program covers all possible cases and generates the correct output as per the problem description.
