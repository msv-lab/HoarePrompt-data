Correctness: **False**

The given program does not generate a table where the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is also a square. Additionally, the program does not ensure that each number in the table does not exceed 10^8. 

For example, if we input 2 2, the program output would be:
```
9 16
27 36
```
This output does not satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem description.
