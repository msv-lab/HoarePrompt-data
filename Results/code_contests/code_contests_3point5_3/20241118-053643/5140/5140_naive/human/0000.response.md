Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly and processes each dataset as described.
2. The function `func_1` correctly updates the state of the plane by setting the value to 0 for the exploded bomb and recursively explodes neighboring bombs.
3. The program outputs the final state of the plane for each dataset as expected.
