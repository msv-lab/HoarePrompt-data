Example Answer:
The function `func_1` updates the square at coordinates (y, i) to have no bomb. Therefore, the square at coordinates (y, i) in the `surface` list will be updated from 1 to 0. The rest of the `surface` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **surface is updated with the square at coordinates (y, i) having no bomb**
