Example Answer:
The value of `start` is calculated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than 3, then `start` is assigned the value of `x - 3`, otherwise it is assigned 0. The initial state does not specify the value of `x`, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `start`. Therefore, the output state is: surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (x, y) which is updated to have no bomb.
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (x, y) which is updated to have no bomb**
