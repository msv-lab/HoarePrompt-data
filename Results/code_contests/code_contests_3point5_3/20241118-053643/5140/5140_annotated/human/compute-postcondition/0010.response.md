According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. If `i` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `surface` is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state, `start`, `end`, and the function `func_1` call status are not provided. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted: `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `end` may need to be adjusted to make sure `i` is less than the new `end` value.
State: **surface is a 2D list of integers, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, `end` may need to be adjusted**
