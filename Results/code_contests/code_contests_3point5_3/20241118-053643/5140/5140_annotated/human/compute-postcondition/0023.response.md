Postcondition: ***`surface[y][i+1]` can be either 1 or 0. The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface, i+1, y` if `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true. The variables `start` and `end` satisfy the conditions `start < end`. The value of `end` is equal to `y + 5` if `y + 4` is less than 8; otherwise, `end` is 8.***
