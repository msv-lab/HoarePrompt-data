Example Answer:
`i` is incremented by 1, and `end` may need to be adjusted in the function `func_1`. The 2D list `surface` is passed into the function `func_1` along with the updated values of `i` and `end`. The exact changes to `end` are not specified, so the output state is: surface is a 2D list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, and `end` may be adjusted.
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, and `end` may be adjusted**
