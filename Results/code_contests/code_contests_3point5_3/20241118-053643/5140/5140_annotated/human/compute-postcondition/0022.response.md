Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x=i+1`, and `y`. The value of `x` is `i+1`, and the value of `y` remains the same. The states of other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `surface[y][i+1]` is either 1 or 0, `func_1(surface, i+1, y)` is called accordingly, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `y + 5` if `y + 4` is less than 8, else 8.
Output State: **`surface[y][i+1]` is either 1 or 0, `func_1(surface, i+1, y)` is called accordingly, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `y + 5` if `y + 4` is less than 8, else 8**
