According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `surface[y][i]` is either 1 or 0, `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called accordingly, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, else 8. If `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true, the corresponding function `func_1` is executed. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- If `y + 4` is less than 8, then `end` should be adjusted to `y + 5`, else `end` should remain 8.

State: **`surface[y][i+1]` is either 1 or 0, `func_1(surface, i+1, y)` is called accordingly, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `y + 5` if `y + 4` is less than 8, else 8**
