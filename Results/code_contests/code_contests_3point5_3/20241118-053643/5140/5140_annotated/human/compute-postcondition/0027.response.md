According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `surface[y][i+1]` can be either 1 or 0. If `surface[i][x]` is true, `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface, x, i`, which results in `start` being incremented by 1 and `end` being adjusted accordingly.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `start` should be incremented by 1 and `end` should be adjusted accordingly based on the changes made by the `func_1` call in the previous iteration.

State: **`surface[y][i+1]` can be either 1 or 0, `surface[i][x]` is true, `func_1` is called with parameters `surface, x, i`, `start` is incremented by 1, `end` is adjusted accordingly**.
