Example Answer:
The variable `end` is assigned the value of `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise it is assigned 8. The previous value of `x` is unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `end`. Therefore, the Output State is: surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (x, y) which is updated to have no bomb.
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (x, y) which is updated to have no bomb**
