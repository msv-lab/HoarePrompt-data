Postcondition: ***surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (x, y) which is updated to have no bomb. This update occurs for the square at coordinates (y, i) if it initially had a bomb. The state of the surface remains consistent between the ranges `start` to `end-1`, where `i` ranges from `start` to `end-1`.***
