According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `start` is less than `end`. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that the square at coordinates (x, y) has no bomb, and the range of values for `i` covers the range from `start` to `end-1`.
State: **surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (x, y) which is updated to have no bomb, `i` ranges from `start` to `end-1`**
