Example Answer:
The square at coordinates (y, i) in the 2D list `surface` is updated to have no bomb, changing its value to 0. The other squares remain unchanged. 
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (y, i) which now has no bomb**
