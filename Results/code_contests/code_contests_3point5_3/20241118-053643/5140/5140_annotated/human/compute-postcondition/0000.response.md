Example Answer:
The square at coordinates (x, y) is updated to have no bomb, meaning the value at surface[y][x] becomes 0. The state of other squares is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (x, y) which is updated to have no bomb.
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb, except for the square at coordinates (x, y) which is updated to have no bomb**
