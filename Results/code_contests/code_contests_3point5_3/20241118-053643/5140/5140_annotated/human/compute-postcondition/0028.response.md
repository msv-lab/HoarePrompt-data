Output State: **If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute. If the loop does execute, the function `func_1` is called for each element `surface[i][x]` that evaluates to true. The values of `surface[y][i]` can be either 1 or 0 after the loop execution. The variables `start` and `end` are adjusted accordingly based on the loop conditions.**
