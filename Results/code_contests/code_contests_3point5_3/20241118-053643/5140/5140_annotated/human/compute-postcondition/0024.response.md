According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `surface[y][i+1]` can be either 1 or 0, the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface, i+1, y` if `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true, `start` and `end` satisfy the conditions `start < end`, and the value of `end` is equal to `y + 5` if `y + 4` is less than 8; otherwise, `end` is 8.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `start` needs to be incremented by 1.
- If `y + 4` is less than 8, then `end` should now be equal to `y + 6`; otherwise, `end` should be incremented by 1 and set to 9.
State: **`surface[y][i+1]` can be either 1 or 0, the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface, i+1, y` if `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true, `start` is incremented by 1, `end` is adjusted as described above**
