Output State: **If the surface[y][i] value is 1, the function func_1(surface, i, y) is called to update the square at coordinates (y, i) to have no bomb. The state of the surface remains consistent between the ranges `start` to `end-1`. If surface[y][i] is 0, no changes are made. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute.**
