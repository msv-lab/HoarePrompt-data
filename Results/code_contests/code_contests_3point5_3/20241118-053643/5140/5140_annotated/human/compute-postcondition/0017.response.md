According to the code, the loop can execute if `start` is less than `end`. The value of `end` is determined as `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, otherwise it is 8. 
Before the loop starts, if `surface[y][i]` is 1, `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called. If `surface[y][i]` is 0, no changes are made. 
To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that `start` is less than `end`. If `surface[y][i]` is 1, `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called. If `surface[y][i]` is 0, no changes are made. The value of `end` is `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, else it is 8. 

State: **`surface[y][i]` is 1 or 0, `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called accordingly, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, else 8**
