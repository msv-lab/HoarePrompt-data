Postcondition: ***surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 for a square with a bomb and 0 for a square without a bomb. If the square at coordinates (y, i) originally had a bomb (surface[y][i] = 1), then the function func_1 was called to update the state of that square. Otherwise, there was no change in the state of the surface.***
