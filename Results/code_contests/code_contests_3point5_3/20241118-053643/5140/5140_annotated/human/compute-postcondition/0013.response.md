According to the code, the loop executes based on the range of `start` to `end`. If `i` is within this range, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, the surface is a 2D list of integers. If the value at surface[y][i] is truthy, then `i` is incremented by 1, and `end` may need to be adjusted. Otherwise, no changes are made.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the value at surface[y][end] is truthy, then `end` should be incremented by 1.
- No other changes need to be made.

State: **surface is a 2D list of integers, if the value at surface[y][end] is truthy, `end` is incremented by 1**
