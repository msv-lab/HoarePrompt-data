Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program recursively updates the state of the squares affected by the bomb explosion as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly handles the chain reaction of bomb explosions by updating the adjacent squares. The loops iterate through the correct range of squares based on the position of the bomb and update the state of the affected squares. The program follows the rules specified in the problem description for bomb explosions and provides the correct final state of the plane for each dataset.
