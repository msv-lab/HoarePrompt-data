The function `func_1` takes in a 2D list `surface` representing a plane with bombs denoted by 1 and no bombs denoted by 0. It also takes integer coordinates `x` and `y` representing the initial bomb to explode. The function then updates the squares around the initial bomb recursively by setting them to 0 if they contain a bomb. The function does not have a specific return value. The loops iterate through the neighboring squares based on certain conditions, but there is a missing logic regarding handling cases where the values of `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` are 0, which should be addressed for completeness.
