Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where a bomb explodes and affects the three squares above, below, left, and right of the bomb. The program only sets the current bomb's square to 0 and recursively calls the explosion function on the same row or column, but it does not handle the chain reaction explosion as described in the problem description. This means that the program does not fully implement the requirements of the problem.
