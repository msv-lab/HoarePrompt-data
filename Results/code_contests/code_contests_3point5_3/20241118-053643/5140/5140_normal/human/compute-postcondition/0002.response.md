Example Answer:
The variable `end` is assigned the value of `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise it is assigned the value 8. The value of `start` is `x - 3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `surface` is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 as the square with the bomb and 0 as the square without the bomb. The square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0. `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, else 8.
