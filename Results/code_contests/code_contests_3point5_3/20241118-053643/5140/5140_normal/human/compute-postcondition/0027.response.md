At the end of the last iteration, the variables `start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, and `y` have been adjusted based on the condition that row `y` still contains at least one bomb. After the if statement executes and `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true, the function `func_1` is called, and the variables `start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, and `y` are potentially modified. Since the impact of `func_1` on these variables is uncertain, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the loop can execute again.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, `y` are adjusted based on the condition that row `y` still contains at least one bomb after the previous iteration and the potential modifications made by `func_1`.**
