According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the range of `i` from `start` to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, the square at coordinates (x, y) in the 2D list `surface` has been updated to 0. The range of `i` has been adjusted from the updated `start` to `end` for the next iteration. If the condition `surface[y][i]` is true, then the function `func_1(surface, i, y)` has been executed with the given parameters. No changes occur if the condition is false. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `end` needs to be incremented by 1 to include the current value of `i` that was last updated. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The square at coordinates (x, y) in the 2D list `surface` has been updated to 0. The range of `i` has been adjusted from the updated `start` to `end + 1**.
