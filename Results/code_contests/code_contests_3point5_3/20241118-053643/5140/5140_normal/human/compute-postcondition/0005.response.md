Output State: **`surface` is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 as the square with the bomb and 0 as the square without the bomb where the square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0, `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, else 8. The value at position `i` in row `y` of `surface` is 0**
