Postcondition: ***`start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, `y` are adjusted based on the condition that row `y` still contains at least one bomb. After the if statement executes and `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true, the function `func_1` is called, and the variables `start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, and `y` are potentially modified based on the execution of `func_1`. The impact of `func_1` on these variables is uncertain and depends on the specific implementation within `func_1`.***
