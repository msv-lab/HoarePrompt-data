Postcondition: ***The square at coordinates (x, y) in the 2D list `surface` has been updated to 0. The range of `i` has been adjusted from the updated `start` to `end` for the next iteration. If the condition `surface[y][i]` is true, then the function `func_1(surface, i, y)` has been executed with the given parameters. No changes occur if the condition is false.***
