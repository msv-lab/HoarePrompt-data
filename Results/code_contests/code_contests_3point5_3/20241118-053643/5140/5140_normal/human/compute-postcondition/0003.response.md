According to the code, the loop can execute if the range defined by `start` and `end` is valid. Therefore, the loop will execute if `start` is less than `end`. In this case, `start` is `x - 3` and `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, else 8. Additionally, the plane state represented by `surface` should be adjusted to reflect the change where the square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0.

State: **`surface` is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 as the square with the bomb and 0 as the square without the bomb where the square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0, `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, else 8**
