According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `start` and `end`, which in turn depend on the current value of `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, the square at coordinates (x, y) in the 2D list `surface` has been changed to 0. The range of `i` is from `start` to `end`, where `start` is `x - 3` and `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise `end` is 8. The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y` for all cases where `surface[y][i]` is true.

To adjust the states for the next iteration and ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. If `end` is already 8, then `start` and `end` do not need to be adjusted as the loop will not iterate beyond the current range.
2. If `end` is less than 8, then `end` needs to be adjusted based on the updated value of `x` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. 
3. The value of `i` also needs to be adjusted based on the updated `start` and `end` to continue iterating within the new range.

State: **The square at coordinates (x, y) in the 2D list `surface` has been changed to 0. The range of `i` is adjusted from the updated `start` to `end` for the next iteration.**
