The function `func_1` accepts parameters `surface`, `x`, and `y`. `surface` is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 as the square with the bomb and 0 as the square without the bomb. `x` and `y` are integers representing the coordinates of the first bomb to explode, such that 1 <= x <= 8 and 1 <= y <= 8. The function does not have a specified return value as the desired output is not provided.
