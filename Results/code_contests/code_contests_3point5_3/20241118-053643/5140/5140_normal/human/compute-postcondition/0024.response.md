According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If the condition in the if statement is true and there is still at least one bomb in row `y`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, `y` are adjusted based on the condition that row `y` still contains at least one bomb. If the condition in the if statement is true, `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x`, `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted based on the condition in the if statement and ensuring that row `y` still contains at least one bomb.
