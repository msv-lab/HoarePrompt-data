Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The function executes some code inside but the impact on the initial state variables is not provided. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, `y` are adjusted accordingly with the condition that row `y` still contains at least one bomb**
