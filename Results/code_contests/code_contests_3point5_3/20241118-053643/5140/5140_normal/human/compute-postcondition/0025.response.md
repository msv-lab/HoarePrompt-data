Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The function execution may impact the variables `start` and `end` based on the condition that row `y` still contains at least one bomb. The values of `start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, and `y` are adjusted within the function. Since the exact impact on these variables is not provided, the output state after running the function is uncertain.
Output State: **The impact on the variables `start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, and `y` is uncertain after running the function `func_1`.**
