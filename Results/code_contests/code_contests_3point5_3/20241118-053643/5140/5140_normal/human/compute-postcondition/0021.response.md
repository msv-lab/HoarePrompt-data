According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition that row `y` contains at least one bomb. At the end of the last iteration, the `surface` array at index `i` and `x` evaluates to true. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the condition that row `y` contains at least one bomb must still hold true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`start`, `end`, `surface`, `i`, `y` are adjusted accordingly with the condition that row `y` still contains at least one bomb**
