According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `start`, and `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `surface` is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state where the square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0. The value at position `i` in row `y` of `surface` is 0 after the execution of the if statement. The range of `i` is from `start` to `end`, where `start` is `x - 3` and `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise `end` is 8. The program ensures that the function `func_1` is called appropriately for all true cases of `surface[y][i]`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, considering that `i`, `start`, and `end` are crucial for the loop to continue:
- `i` should be updated to the next value after the previous iteration.
- `start` should be updated based on the new value of `i`.
- `end` should be updated based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`surface` is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state where the square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0. The value at position `i` in row `y` of `surface` is 0 after the execution of the if statement. The range of `i` is from `start` to `end`, where `start` is `x - 3` and `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise `end` is 8. The program handles all cases where `surface[y][i]` is true, ensuring that the function `func_1` is called appropriately. Adjusted states for the next iteration will depend on the specific values of `x`, `y`, and the updated values of `i`, `start`, and `end` after the adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.**
