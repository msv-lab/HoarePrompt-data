Output State: **The loop iterates through the range of `i` from `start` to `end`, where `start` is `x - 3` and `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise `end` is 8. If the square at coordinates (x, y) in the 2D list `surface` contains a bomb (value is 1), the square is changed to 0. The function `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called for each bomb found. The loop will not execute if the row `y` does not contain any bombs (all values are 0).**
