Postcondition: ***`surface` is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state where the square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0. The value at position `i` in row `y` of `surface` is 0 after the execution of the if statement. The range of `i` is from `start` to `end`, where `start` is `x - 3` and `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise `end` is 8. The program handles all cases where `surface[y][i]` is true, ensuring that the function `func_1` is called appropriately.***
