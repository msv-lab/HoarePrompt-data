Example Answer: 
The start variable is assigned the value of x - 3 if x - 3 is greater than 0, otherwise it is assigned 0. Since the square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0, the value of x is known to be at least 3. Therefore, start will be x - 3. 
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers representing the plane state with 1 as the square with the bomb and 0 as the square without the bomb. The square at coordinates (x, y) has been changed to 0. start is x - 3**
