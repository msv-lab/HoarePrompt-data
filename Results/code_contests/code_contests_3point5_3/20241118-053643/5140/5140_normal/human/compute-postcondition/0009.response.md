Postcondition: ***The square at coordinates (x, y) in the 2D list `surface` has been changed to 0 after the execution of the if statement. The range of `i` is from `start` to `end`, where `start` is `x - 3` and `end` is `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise `end` is 8. The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y` for all cases where `surface[y][i]` is true. The adjusted states for the next iteration will depend on the specific values of `x`, `y`, and the updated values of `i`, `start`, and `end` after the adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, ensuring all edge cases are handled appropriately.***
