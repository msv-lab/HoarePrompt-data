Example Answer:
The function `func_1` takes in the 2D list `surface`, the variable `i`, and the variable `y`. The square at coordinates `(x, y)` in the 2D list `surface` has been changed to 0. The range of `i` is adjusted from the updated `start` to `end` for the next iteration. The specific impact of the function on the program cannot be determined without the implementation details. Therefore, the Output State is: The program has executed the function `func_1(surface, i, y)` with the given parameters.
Output State: **The program has executed the function `func_1(surface, i, y)` with the given parameters.**
