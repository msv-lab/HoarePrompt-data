Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly handles the scenario where a bomb explodes and affects the three squares above, below, left, and right of the bomb. It recursively explodes neighboring bombs in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- The code sets the square at coordinates (x, y) to 0 and then recursively calls itself for neighboring squares containing bombs.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case and produces the correct final plane state after the bombs explode.
