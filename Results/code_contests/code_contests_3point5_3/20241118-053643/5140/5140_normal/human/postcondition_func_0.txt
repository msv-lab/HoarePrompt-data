The function func_1 modifies a 2D list `surface` representing a plane state with bombs indicated by 1s and empty squares by 0s. It starts by setting the square at coordinates (x, y) to 0, then recursively calls itself for neighboring squares containing bombs in both horizontal and vertical directions. The function does not have a specified return value.
