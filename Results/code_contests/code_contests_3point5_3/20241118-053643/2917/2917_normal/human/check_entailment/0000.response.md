Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all cases. It reads the input integers, counts the number of negative numbers and zeros, and calculates the total number of coins needed based on the absolute values of the integers. The code adjusts the number of needed coins based on specific conditions related to the counts of negative numbers and zeros. Finally, it prints the total number of coins needed as the output. 

The output hints also agree with the code and further confirm that the code is correct in handling all potential cases. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
