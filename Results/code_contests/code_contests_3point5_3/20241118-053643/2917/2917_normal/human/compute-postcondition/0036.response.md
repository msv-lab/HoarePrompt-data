Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. If `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. The loop covers all edge cases and ensures proper updating of `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` based on the conditions. In the case where the number of negative numbers encountered so far (`neg`) is odd, `needed_coins` is increased by the value of `num_zeros` if it is greater than 0; otherwise, `needed_coins` is incremented by 2. Conversely, if the number of negatives in the `neg` is even, `needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros` after the execution of the code snippet.***
