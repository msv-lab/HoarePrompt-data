The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `numbers` is a list of integers with length `n`, where each integer in `numbers` is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it performs a specific operation or task based on the input list of numbers under the given constraints.
