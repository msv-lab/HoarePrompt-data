Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num` is 0 if `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, `neg` is incremented by 1 if `num` is negative, `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1, the loop covers all edge cases and ensures proper updating of `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins based on the conditions, the number of negative numbers encountered so far (`neg`) is an odd value, and the number of zeros encountered (`num_zeros`) is not greater than 0, `needed_coins` is still incremented based on the conditions, `needed_coins` is incremented by 2**
