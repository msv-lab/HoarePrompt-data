Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, the value of `n` after execution will also be a positive integer. The list `numbers` is not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, numbers is a list of integers with length n. Each integer in numbers is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]**
