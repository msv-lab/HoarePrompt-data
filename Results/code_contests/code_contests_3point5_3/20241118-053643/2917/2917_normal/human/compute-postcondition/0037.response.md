Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1 if `num` is 0, `neg` is incremented by 1 if `num` is negative, `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. If the number of negative numbers encountered so far (`neg`) is odd, `needed_coins` is increased by the value of `num_zeros` if it is greater than 0; otherwise, `needed_coins` is incremented by 2. If the number of negatives in `neg` is even, `needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`. The final value of `needed_coins` is printed.**
