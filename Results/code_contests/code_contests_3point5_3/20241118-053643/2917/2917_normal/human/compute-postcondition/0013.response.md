Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. If the first integer in the `numbers` list is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1.***
