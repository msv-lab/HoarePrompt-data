Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `neg` is either 0 or 1 based on whether the first integer in the `numbers` list is less than 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0. If the first integer in the `numbers` list is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1.***
