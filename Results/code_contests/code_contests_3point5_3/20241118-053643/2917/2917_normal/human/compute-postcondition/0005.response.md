According to the code, the loop can execute if the `numbers` list has at least 1 integer. At the start of the loop, `num` will take the value of each integer in the list sequentially. Since `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` are initialized to 0, they do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `numbers` list must have at least 1 integer, and `num` will take the value of the first integer in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the `numbers` list**
