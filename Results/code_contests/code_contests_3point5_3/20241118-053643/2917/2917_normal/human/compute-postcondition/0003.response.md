Example Answer:
`num_zeros` is assigned the value 0. The variables `n` (positive integer), `numbers` (list of integers with length n), and `neg` (0) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with length n, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with length n, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0**
