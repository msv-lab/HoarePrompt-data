Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of integers `numbers` of length `n`. It then counts the number of negative numbers encountered, the number of zeros in the list, and calculates the total number of coins needed based on the absolute values of the integers in the list. The function adjusts the number of needed coins based on specific conditions related to the counts of negative numbers and zeros. Finally, it prints the total number of coins needed as the output.**
