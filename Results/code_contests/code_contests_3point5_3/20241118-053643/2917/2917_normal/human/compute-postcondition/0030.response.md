Example Answer: 
`needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`, and `num_zeros` is already greater than 0. Therefore, `needed_coins` is further increased by the value of `num_zeros`. The states of `neg` and `num_zeros` remain the same as they are not affected by this operation. Since the loop ensures that `neg` is an odd value and `num_zeros` is greater than 0, these conditions are maintained. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, `neg` is incremented by 1, `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1, `neg` is an odd value, `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` is further incremented by the value of `num_zeros`**
