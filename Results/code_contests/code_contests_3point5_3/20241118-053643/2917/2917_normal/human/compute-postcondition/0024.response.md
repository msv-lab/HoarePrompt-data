Example Answer: 
The `needed_coins` variable is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 2, and if the first integer in the `numbers` list is negative, `neg` is incremented by 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `neg` is either incremented by 3 based on the first integer in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is either incremented by 2 if `num` is 0, and `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `neg` is either incremented by 3 based on the first integer in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is either incremented by 2 if `num` is 0, and `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1**
