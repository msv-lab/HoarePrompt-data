Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. If `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. The loop covers all edge cases and ensures proper updating of `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` based on the conditions. The number of negatives in the `neg` is even***
