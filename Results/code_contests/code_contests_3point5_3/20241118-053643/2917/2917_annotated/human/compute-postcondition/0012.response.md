Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list. If `num` is less than 0, then `neg` is increased by 1. In all other cases, including when `num` is not less than 0, `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain unchanged. `needed_coins` is increased by the absolute value of `num` minus 1.**
