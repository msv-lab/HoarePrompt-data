According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list. To execute one more time, the list should have at least 3 elements. The `num` should be the third element in the list. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list**.
