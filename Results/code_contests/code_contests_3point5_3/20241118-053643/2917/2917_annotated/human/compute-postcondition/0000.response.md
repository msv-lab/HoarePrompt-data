Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input as a string and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is now determined by the user input, satisfying the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5**
