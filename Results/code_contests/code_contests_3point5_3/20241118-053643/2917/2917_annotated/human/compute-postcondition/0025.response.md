Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list. If `num` is less than 0, `neg` is incremented by 1. If `num` is equal to 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. In all other cases, the variables retain their initial values and relationships. `needed_coins` is updated by subtracting 1 from the absolute value of `num`.***
