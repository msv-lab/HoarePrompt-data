Example Answer:
`neg` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, numbers is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input to integers, neg is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, numbers is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input to integers, neg is 0**
