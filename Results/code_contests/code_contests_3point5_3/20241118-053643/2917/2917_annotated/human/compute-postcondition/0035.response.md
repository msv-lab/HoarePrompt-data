Example Answer:
After executing the code, `needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`. The values of `neg` and `num_zeros` are unaffected as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain the same as the precondition, and `needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`.
Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0 and `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element, then `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain the same as the precondition, and `needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`**
