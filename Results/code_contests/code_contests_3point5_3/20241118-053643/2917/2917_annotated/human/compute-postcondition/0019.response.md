Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list. If `num` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is increased by the absolute value of `num` minus 1.***
