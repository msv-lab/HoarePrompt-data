Example Answer:
`neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list, `neg` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list, `neg` is incremented by 1**
