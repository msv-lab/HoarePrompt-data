Example Answer: 
`num_zeros` is assigned the value 0. The variables `n` and `numbers` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, numbers is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input to integers, neg is 0, num_zeros is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, numbers is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input to integers, neg is 0, num_zeros is 0**
