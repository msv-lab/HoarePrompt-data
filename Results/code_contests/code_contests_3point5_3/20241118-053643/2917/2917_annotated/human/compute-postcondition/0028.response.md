Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element, and the loop executes, then `neg` is the count of negative numbers in the list, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in the list, and `needed_coins` is the sum of absolute values of all non-zero numbers minus the count of non-zero numbers. If `n` is 0 or `numbers` is an empty list, then `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0. After entering the if condition, `neg` is an odd number***
