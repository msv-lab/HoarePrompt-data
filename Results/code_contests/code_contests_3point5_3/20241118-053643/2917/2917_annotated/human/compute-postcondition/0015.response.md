Example Answer:
The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is unknown, but since it's an increment operation, it can be assumed that `neg` was 0 initially. Therefore, after execution, `neg` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list, `neg` is 1**
