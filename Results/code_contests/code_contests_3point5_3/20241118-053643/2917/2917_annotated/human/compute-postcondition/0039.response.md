Functionality: **The function `func` reads a list of integers, counts the number of negative numbers, zeros, and calculates the total number of coins needed based on the absolute values of non-zero numbers. If the count of negative numbers is odd, it adjusts the needed coins based on the presence of zeros in the list. The function then prints the final count of needed coins.**
