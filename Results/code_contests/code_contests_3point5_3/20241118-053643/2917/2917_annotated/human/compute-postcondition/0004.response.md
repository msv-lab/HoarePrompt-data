Example Answer:
`needed_coins` is initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, numbers is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input to integers, neg is 0, num_zeros is 0, needed_coins is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, numbers is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input to integers, neg is 0, num_zeros is 0, needed_coins is 0**
