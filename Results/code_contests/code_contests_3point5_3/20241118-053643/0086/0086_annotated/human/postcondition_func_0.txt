The function `func` reads input from the user, processes the input string `s` character by character, and maintains a stack based on certain conditions. The stack is updated by appending or popping characters according to the rules specified in the code. The function then prints the length of the final stack. The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is solely dependent on the constraints of the input string `s` and the stack operations.
