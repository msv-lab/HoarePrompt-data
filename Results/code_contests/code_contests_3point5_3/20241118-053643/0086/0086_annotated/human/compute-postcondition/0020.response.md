Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is a string input from the user with length greater than 0. If the stack was initially empty or the character at index i in s is 'S', then that character is appended to the stack and the index i is incremented by 1. If the top element of the stack was 'S', it is removed. Otherwise, the character at index i from string s is appended to the stack. If the stack contains all 'S' characters from string s, no changes are made to the stack.***
