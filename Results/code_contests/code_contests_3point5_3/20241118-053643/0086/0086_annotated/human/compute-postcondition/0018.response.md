Output State: **X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is a string input from the user with length greater than 0. If the stack was initially empty or the character at index i in s is 'S', then that character is appended to the stack and the index i is incremented by 1. The stack is updated based on the conditions described above. Otherwise, the stack remains unchanged.**
