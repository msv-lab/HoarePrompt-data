Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is a string input from the user with length greater than 0. The stack contains a combination of 'S' and 'T' characters based on the conditions mentioned. If the character at index i in string s is 'T' and the top of the stack is 'S', then 'S' is removed from the stack. Otherwise, the character at index i from string s is appended to the stack. The stack follows the rules of appending and popping characters as per the given conditions, ensuring the initial state of X, s, and the stack is maintained. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including the cases where the stack is empty or the character at index i in string s is 'S'.***
