Example Answer: 
The character at index i in string s is appended to the stack if the stack was initially empty or the character at index i in s is 'S'. As the stack starts empty and the characters in X are 'S' and 'T' alternately, only 'S' characters will be appended to the stack. Therefore, after the execution, the stack will contain all the 'S' characters from string s.
Output State: **Stack contains all 'S' characters from string s**
