Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is a string input from the user with length greater than 0. The stack is updated based on the conditions where if the character at index i in s is 'T' and the top element of the stack is 'S', the top element is removed. If the top element of the stack is not 'S', the character at index i from string s is appended to the stack. If the stack contains all 'S' characters from string s, no changes are made to the stack. If the character at index i in s is 'S' or the stack was initially empty, the character at index i is appended to the stack and the index i is incremented by 1.***
