Output State: **X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'; s is a non-empty string input from the user. The stack contains a combination of 'S' and 'T' characters based on the conditions of the loop. The loop will execute for all characters in string s, and the stack will be updated accordingly. If the character at index i in s is 'T' and the top of the stack is 'S', 'S' is removed from the stack. Otherwise, the character at index i from string s is appended to the stack. The stack follows the rules of appending and popping characters as per the given conditions, ensuring the initial state of X, s, and the stack is maintained. If s is an empty string, the loop does not execute and the stack remains empty.**
