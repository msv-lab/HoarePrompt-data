Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is a string input from the user with length greater than 0. If the length of stack is 0 or the character at index i in string s is 'S', then stack appends the character at index i from string s. If the character at the top of the stack was 'S', it is removed. Otherwise, the character at index i from string s is appended to the stack. The stack contains a combination of 'S' and 'T' characters based on the conditions mentioned, maintaining the initial conditions of X, s, and the stack. This covers all possible cases including the edge cases where the stack is empty or the character at index i in string s is 'S'.***
