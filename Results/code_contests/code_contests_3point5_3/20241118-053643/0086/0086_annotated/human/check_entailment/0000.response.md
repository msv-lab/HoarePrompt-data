Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It maintains a stack to keep track of the characters 'S' and 'T' based on the conditions of the loop. The program iterates through the input string, and for each character, it appropriately updates the stack by adding or removing characters based on the specified rules. After processing the entire input string, the program prints the length of the stack, which represents the eventual length of the string X. The code handles the cases where 'ST' substrings need to be removed correctly, resulting in the expected output. The program works for all possible input cases as described in the problem statement.
