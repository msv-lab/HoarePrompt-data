The function `func` reads input from the user, processes a string `X` of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. It maintains a stack where 'S' and 'T' characters are alternately added and removed based on certain conditions. The function then prints the length of the final stack. If the input string `X` does not meet the specified criteria, the stack manipulation may not occur as expected.
