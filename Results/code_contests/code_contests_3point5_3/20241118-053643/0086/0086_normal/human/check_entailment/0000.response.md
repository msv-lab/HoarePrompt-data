Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is supposed to remove the leftmost occurrence of the substring 'ST' in the string 'X'. However, the code does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if the input string is 'SSTTST', the expected output is 0, as the 'ST' substring should be removed completely. But the code provided will output 2, as it only removes one occurrence of 'ST' and leaves the other one. This is a case where the code does not work as expected according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
