Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. The stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T'. If the character at index i of X is 'T' and the top of the stack is 'S', then 'S' is removed from the stack. If the top of the stack is not 'S', then the character at index i+1 of X is appended to the stack. The loop continues with the stack maintaining the alternation of 'S' and 'T' characters.***
