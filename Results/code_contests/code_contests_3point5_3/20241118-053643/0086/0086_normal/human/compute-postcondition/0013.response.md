Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. stack contains the character at index i from string X, where i is incremented by 1. If the length of stack is 0 or the character at index i of string X is 'S', then 'S' is appended to stack. Otherwise, the execution continues without any changes. If s[i] is 'T', then 'S' is appended to stack. After the execution of the if else block, if the last element of stack is 'S', it is removed from the stack. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to stack. This ensures that the stack maintains the correct balance of 'S' and 'T' characters based on the defined conditions and operations, handling all possible edge cases and maintaining the integrity of the stack contents.***
