Example Answer:
The character at index `i` in the string `X` is appended to the stack. Since the stack already contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T', appending the character at index `i` maintains this alternating pattern. Therefore, the Output State is: X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'; the stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T'.
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'; the stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T'**
