Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', `stack` contains the character at index `i` from string `X`, `i` is incremented by 1. If the length of `stack` is 0 or the character at index `i` of string `X` is 'S', then 'S' is appended to `stack`. Otherwise, the execution continues without any changes. If `s[i]` is 'T', then 'S' is appended to `stack`. The last element of `stack` is 'S'***
