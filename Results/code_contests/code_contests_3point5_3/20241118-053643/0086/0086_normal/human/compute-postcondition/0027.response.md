Example Answer:
The character at index `i` in X is appended to the stack if the character is 'S'. Since the stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T', if the character at index `i` in X is 'S', it will be appended to the stack. If the character is 'T' or the stack is empty, no changes are made to the stack. Therefore, the Output State is: X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. The stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T'.
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. The stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T'**
