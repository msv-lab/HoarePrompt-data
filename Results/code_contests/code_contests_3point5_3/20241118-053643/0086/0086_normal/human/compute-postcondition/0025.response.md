Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. The stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T'. If the length of the stack is 0 or the character at index i in X is 'S', then 'S' is appended to the stack and the loop continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to the stack.***
