Example Answer: 
A character from X at index i+1 is appended to the stack. Since the character is determined by i+1, the characters appended to the stack will follow the same order as in X. Therefore, the characters 'S' and 'T' from string X will be appended to the stack alternately. 
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'; stack contains alternately 'S' and 'T' characters**
