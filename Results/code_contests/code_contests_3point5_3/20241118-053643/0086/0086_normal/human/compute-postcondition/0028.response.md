Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. The stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T' except for the last character. If the character at index i in X is 'S' or the length of the stack is 0, then 'S' is appended to the stack. Otherwise, if the last character in the stack is 'S', it is removed.***
