Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. Since `s` is already defined as a string of even length with half 'S' and half 'T', the value of `s` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'.
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'**
