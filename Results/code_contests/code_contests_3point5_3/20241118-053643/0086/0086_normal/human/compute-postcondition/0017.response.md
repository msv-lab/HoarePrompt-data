Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. The stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T'. If the length of stack is 0 or the character at index i of X is 'S', then the character at index i+1 of X is appended to the stack and the loop continues. In all other cases, no changes are made to the stack and the loop continues.***
