Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half of the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'. The stack contains characters alternately 'S' and 'T'. If the character at the top of the stack was 'S', it is removed. Otherwise, the character at index i+1 of X is appended to the stack. The loop continues with the stack maintaining the alternation of 'S' and 'T' characters.***
