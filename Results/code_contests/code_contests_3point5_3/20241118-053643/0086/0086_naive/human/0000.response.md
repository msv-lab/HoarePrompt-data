Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the described operation of removing the leftmost occurrence of "ST" in the string X. It maintains a stack to keep track of the characters encountered so far. The program checks if the current character is 'S' or if the stack is empty, then it appends the character to the stack. If the current character is 'T' and the top of the stack is 'S', it removes the 'S' from the stack. Otherwise, it appends 'T' to the stack. Finally, it prints the length of the stack which represents the eventual length of X after all the operations. The program handles all cases where the operation is performed correctly as described in the problem statement.
