Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is incremented by 1, `c` is updated properly based on loop conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `lol[0]` and `lol` are not in the same list, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the loop breaks. Otherwise, `same` contains the appended `temp[0]`.**
