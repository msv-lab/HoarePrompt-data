Example Answer:
`lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The values of `count`, `temp`, and `same` remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: count is 0, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, same is undefined.
Output State: **count is 0, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, same is undefined**
