Example Answer:
Since `temp` is reassigned as an empty list, all previous values stored in `temp` are lost. Therefore, the new state is: count is 0, temp is an empty list, lol is undefined, and same is undefined.
Output State: **count is 0, temp is an empty list, lol is undefined, same is undefined**
