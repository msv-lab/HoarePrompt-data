Postcondition: ***count is an integer incremented by 2, temp has the appended value [order[i], order[count]], lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp, and lol appends order[i]. If the length of "same" is equal to the integer value in "inp[1]", then the program execution breaks. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of count, temp, and lol.***
