Postcondition: ***If `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 1, `temp` list is emptied, `lol` list is reset to an empty list, `same` list's length is either increased by 1 or remains the same, and the values in `same` are updated accordingly. If the condition `len(same) == int(inp[1])` is met, the loop breaks. In case `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` lists are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues.***
