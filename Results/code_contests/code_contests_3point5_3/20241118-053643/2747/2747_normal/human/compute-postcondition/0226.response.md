Example Answer:
Since `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`, the previous values of `count`, `temp`, and `lol` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer incremented by 2, temp is an empty list, lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp, and lol appends order[i].
Output State: **count is an integer incremented by 2, temp is an empty list, lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp, and lol appends order[i]**
