Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is unknown, but it is guaranteed to be less than `int(inp[0]) + 1`. Therefore, the output state is: count is an integer where count is less than `int(inp[0]) + 1`.
Output State: **count is an integer where count is less than `int(inp[0]) + 1`**
