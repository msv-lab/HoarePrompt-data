Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is updated by 1, `temp` list has no elements, `lol` list is empty, `same` list has a new element appended with the value of the first element of `temp` list, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the loop is broken.**
