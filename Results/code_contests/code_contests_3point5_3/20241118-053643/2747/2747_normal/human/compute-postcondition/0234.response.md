Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: count is an integer incremented by 2, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, lol appends order[i], same appends temp[0].
Output State: **count is an integer incremented by 2, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, lol appends order[i], same appends temp[0]**
