Postcondition: ***count is an integer where count is less than `int(inp[0]) + 1`. If c == len(a) - 1, count is increased by 1 and c is reset to 0. Otherwise, c is incremented by 1 and count is increased by 1. This ensures that count remains within the specified range and c is appropriately updated based on the conditions met during the execution of the if-else block.***
