Postcondition: ***count is an integer incremented by 1, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list. If temp[0] is in same or lol is in same, temp and lol are reset to empty lists, count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of same is equal to the integer value of inp[1], the iteration breaks. If none of the previous conditions are met, same is appended with the first element of temp (which is empty), and necessary adjustments for same have been made.***
