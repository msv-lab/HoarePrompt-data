Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated based on loop conditions, `temp` list has a new element appended, `lol` list has the second element of the newly added element in `temp` list. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value in `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
