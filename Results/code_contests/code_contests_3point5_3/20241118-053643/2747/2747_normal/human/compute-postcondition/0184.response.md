Output State: **If `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 1, `temp` list contains the appended value `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` list contains the appended value `temp[0][1]`, `same` list's length is either increased by 1 or remains the same, the values in `same` are updated accordingly, and `lol` appends `temp[0][0]`. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` lists are reset, `count` is increased by 1, and the program continues. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks. In the else part, if none of the above conditions are met, `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` and `lol` lists are reset, and `count` is increased by 1.**
