Example Answer:
`lol` appends the value at index 0 of the first element of `temp`, which is `order[i]`. The value of `count` is unknown, so `temp` is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer incremented by 2, temp has the appended value [order[i], order[count]], lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp, and lol appends order[i].
Output State: **count is an integer incremented by 2, temp has the appended value [order[i], order[count]], lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp, and lol appends order[i]**
