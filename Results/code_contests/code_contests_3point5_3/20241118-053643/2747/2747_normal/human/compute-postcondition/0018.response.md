Output State: **`n`, `l`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k, n*k <= 10^6 and 1 <= l <= 10^18. `a` contains n positive integers between 1 and 10^9. `order` contains the element `a[c]`. `same` is an empty list. `c` is either 0 or 1, depending on the condition. `i` is 0. `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0. `count` is increased by 1. If c is equal to the length of a minus 1, c is reset to 0. Otherwise, if c is not equal to len(a) - 1, c is incremented by 1. In both cases, count is incremented by 1. `count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0]) - 1. `c` is increased by 1.**
