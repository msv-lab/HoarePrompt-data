Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `c` is updated properly based on loop conditions, `temp` contains a new sublist with elements `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` contains the value of `temp[0][1]`, `temp[0]` and `lol` are not in the `same` list, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the loop breaks. Otherwise, `same` contains the appended `temp[0]`.**
