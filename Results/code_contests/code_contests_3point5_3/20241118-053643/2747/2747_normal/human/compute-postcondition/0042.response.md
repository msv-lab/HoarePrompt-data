Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is unknown, so the new value of `c` is `c + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer where count is less than int(inp[0]); c is incremented by 1.
Output State: **count is an integer where count is less than int(inp[0]); c is incremented by 1**
