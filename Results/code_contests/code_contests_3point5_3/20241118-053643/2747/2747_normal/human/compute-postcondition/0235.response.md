Postcondition: ***count is an integer incremented by 3, temp is an empty list, lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp, and lol appends order[i] if temp[0] is in same or lol is in same. If temp[0] is not in same or lol is not in same, count is an integer incremented by 2, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, same appends temp[0], and if the length of same is equal to the integer represented by inp[1], the loop breaks.***
