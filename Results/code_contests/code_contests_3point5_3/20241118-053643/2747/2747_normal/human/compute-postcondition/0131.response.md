Output State: **If `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated based on loop conditions. After the loop finishes, the `temp` and `lol` lists may contain elements based on the iterations of the loop. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in the `same` list, they are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` reaches `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, a new element is appended to the `same` list, and `count` is incremented by 1.**
