Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is updated by 1 in both branches. In the if part, `temp` and `lol` lists are reset, and a new element is appended to `same` or `lol` based on the condition. In the else part, `temp` and `lol` lists are reset, a new element is appended to `same`, and if the length of `same` reaches `int(inp[1])`, the loop is broken.***
