Postcondition: ***inp[0] is greater than or equal to 0, order list has at least 1 element. If temp[0] or lol is in same, then temp and lol are reset, count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if len(same) == int(inp[1]), the loop breaks. If neither condition is met, same appends temp[0], temp and lol are reset, count is incremented by 1. In all cases, the state of the program ensures the integrity of the initial conditions with appropriate updates and potential edge cases handled effectively.***
