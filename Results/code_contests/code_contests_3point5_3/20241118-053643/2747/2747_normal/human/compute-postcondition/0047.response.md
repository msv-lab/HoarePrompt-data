Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is less than int(inp[0]) + 1. The value of `c` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer where count is less than int(inp[0]) + 1 and `c` is 0.
Output State: **count is an integer where count is less than int(inp[0]) + 1 and `c` is 0**
