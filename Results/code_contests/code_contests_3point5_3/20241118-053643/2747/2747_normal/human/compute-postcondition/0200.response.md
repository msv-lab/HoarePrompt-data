Postcondition: ***count is 0, temp contains a list with values [order[i], order[count]], lol contains the value temp[0][1], lol contains order[i]. Neither temp[0] nor lol are in the list same. The length of same is equal to the integer value of inp[1]. If the length of same is equal to int(inp[1]), then the program breaks from the loop. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes in the variables count, temp, and lol.***
