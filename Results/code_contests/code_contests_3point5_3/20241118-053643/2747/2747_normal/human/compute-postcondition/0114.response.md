Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated based on loop conditions, `temp` list has a new element appended. If `temp[0]` is in `same` list or `lol` is in `same` list, then `temp`, `lol` are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value in `inp[1]`, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. In the else part, `temp`, `lol` are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1, and a new element is appended to the `same` list.***
