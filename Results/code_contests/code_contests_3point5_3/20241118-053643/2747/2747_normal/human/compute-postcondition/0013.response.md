Output State: **`n`, `l`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k, n*k <= 10^6 and 1 <= l <= 10^18, `a` contains n positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `order` contains the element `a[c]`, `same` is an empty list, `c` is 1, `i` is 0, `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0, `count` is 1, `c` is not equal to `len(a) - 1**
