Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of the first element of the `temp` list is appended to the `lol` list. Since the initial state is not given, we cannot determine the exact value that is being appended. Therefore, the output state is `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated, `temp` list has a new element appended with a value at index 1 of the first element of `temp` list added to `lol` list.
Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated, `temp` list has a new element appended with a value at index 1 of the first element of `temp` list added to `lol` list**
