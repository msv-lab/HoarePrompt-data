Example Answer: 
`c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is unknown. The state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, c is an integer incremented by 1, order contains the element from list a at index 0 with the adjustments mentioned above.
Output State: **count is an integer, c is an integer incremented by 1, order contains the element from list a at index 0 with the adjustments mentioned above**
