Example Answer: 
The value of temp[0][0] is appended to lol. temp contains a list with values [order[i], order[count]], so temp[0][0] is order[i]. Therefore, lol now contains order[i]. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **count is 0, temp contains a list with values [order[i], order[count]], lol contains the value temp[0][1], lol contains order[i]**
