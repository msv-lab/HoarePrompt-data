According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `count` and `order`. If `count` is less than or equal to the length of `order` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is an integer incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Increment `count` by 1.
2. Reset `temp` to an empty list and reset `lol` to an empty list if `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`.
3. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the iteration breaks.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, append the first element of `temp` to `same` (which is currently empty).

State: **count is an integer incremented by 2, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list. If temp[0] is in same or lol is in same, temp and lol are reset to empty lists, count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of same is equal to the integer value of inp[1], the iteration breaks. If none of the previous conditions are met, same is appended with the first element of temp (which is empty)**.
