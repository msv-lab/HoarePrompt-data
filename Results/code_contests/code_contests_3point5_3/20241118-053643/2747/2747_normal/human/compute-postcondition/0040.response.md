Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. The value of `count` is an integer where `count` is less than `int(inp[0])`, but the specific value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer where count is less than `int(inp[0])`, `c` is 0.
Output State: **count is an integer where count is less than `int(inp[0])`, `c` is 0**
