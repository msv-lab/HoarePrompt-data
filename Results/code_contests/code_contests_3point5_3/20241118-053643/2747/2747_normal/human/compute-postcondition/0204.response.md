Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, where the previous value of `count` is 0. After execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: count is 1, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, same is undefined.
Output State: **count is 1, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, same is undefined**
