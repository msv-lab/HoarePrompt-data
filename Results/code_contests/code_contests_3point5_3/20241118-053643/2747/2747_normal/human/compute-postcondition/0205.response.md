Postcondition: ***count is an integer, temp and lol are empty lists. If temp[0] is in same or lol is in same, count is incremented by 1 and temp, lol are set to empty lists. Otherwise, if the length of same is equal to the integer value of inp[1], the program exits the loop. If none of these conditions are met, temp[0] is appended to same, temp and lol are reset to empty lists, and count is incremented by 1.***
