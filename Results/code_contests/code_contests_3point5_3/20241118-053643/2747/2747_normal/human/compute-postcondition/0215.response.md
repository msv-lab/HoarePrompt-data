Postcondition: ***count is an integer (incremented by 1), temp contains a newly appended list, lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp, and the necessary adjustments for `same` have been made. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value at index 1 of `inp`, then the execution breaks. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
