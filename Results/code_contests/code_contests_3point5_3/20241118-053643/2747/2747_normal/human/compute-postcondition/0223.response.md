Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of `temp` is appended to the list `lol`. Since `temp` consists of `[order[i], order[count]]`, the value at index 1 of the first element of `temp` is appended to `lol`. Therefore, the output state is: count is an integer incremented by 2, temp has the appended value [order[i], order[count]], lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp.
Output State: **count is an integer incremented by 2, temp has the appended value [order[i], order[count]], lol contains the value at index 1 of the first element of temp**
