Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `count` is an integer less than `int(inp[0]) + 1`, but the specific value is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: count is an integer where count is less than int(inp[0]) + 1, `c` is `0`.
Output State: **count is an integer where count is less than int(inp[0]) + 1, `c` is `0`**
