Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `c` is updated properly based on loop conditions, `temp` contains a new sublist with elements `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` contains the value of `temp[0][1]`, and neither `temp[0]` nor `lol` are in the `same` list. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the initial state.***
