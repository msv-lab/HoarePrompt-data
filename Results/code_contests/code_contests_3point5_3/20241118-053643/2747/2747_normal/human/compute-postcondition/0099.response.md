Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated based on loop conditions. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in the `same` list, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. If the loop does not break, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, `temp[0]` is appended to the `same` list, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
