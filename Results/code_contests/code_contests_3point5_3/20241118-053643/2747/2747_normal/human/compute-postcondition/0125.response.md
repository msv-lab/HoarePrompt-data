Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated, `temp` list has a new element appended with a value at index 1 of the first element of `temp` list added to `lol` list, `same` has a new element appended with the value of the first element of `temp` list, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the loop is broken.**
