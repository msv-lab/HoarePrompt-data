According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `int(inp[1])` is at least 1. So, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `l`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k, n*k <= 10^6 and 1 <= l <= 10^18, `a` contains n positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `order` is an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0**
