Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of the first element of `temp` list is added to `lol` list. The value of `temp` list has a new element appended. The states of `inp`, `order`, and `count` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated, `temp` list has a new element appended with a value at index 1 of the first element of `temp` list added to `lol` list.
Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `order` list has at least 1 element, `count` is properly updated, `temp` list has a new element appended with a value at index 1 of the first element of `temp` list added to `lol` list**
