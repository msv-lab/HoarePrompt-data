The function `func` reads input, processes the data based on certain conditions, and calculates the length of the 'same' list plus the length of the 'order' list. It then performs a modulo operation with (10^9 + 7) on the sum and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input provided. The function iterates over elements in the 'order' list and constructs pairs based on certain rules while keeping track of the 'same' list. It handles cases where the 'order' list length is 0, 1, or greater than 1. The code may not fully align with the provided annotations due to potential edge cases and missing logic.
