Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned an empty list, so after execution, `temp` is an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is empty, `count` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is empty, `count` is incremented by 2**
