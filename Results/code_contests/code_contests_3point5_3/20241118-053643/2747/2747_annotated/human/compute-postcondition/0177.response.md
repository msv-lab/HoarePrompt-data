Postcondition: ***`same` is a list, `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[4]]`, `lol` is a list containing the second element of the first element in `temp` and the second element of the `order` list, `count` is 4. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value present in `inp[1]`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables.***
