Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1, so `count` becomes 2. The values of `c` and `order` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `c` is 0, `order` contains the element at index 0 of list `a`.
Output State: **`count` is 2, `c` is 0, `order` contains the element at index 0 of list `a`**
