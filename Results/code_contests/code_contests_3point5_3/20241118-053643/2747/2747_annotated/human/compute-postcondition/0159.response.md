Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 2, so after execution, `count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` is a list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 3.
Output State: **`same` is a list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 3**
