Postcondition: ***`same` is a list, `temp` is a list containing the newly appended elements, `lol` contains the element `temp[0][1]`, `count` is 0. If the length of `same` is equal to the non-negative integer value of `inp[1]`, then the program execution halts. Otherwise, `lol` now contains the newly appended element `temp[0][0]`, `temp[0]` and `lol` are not in `same`.***
