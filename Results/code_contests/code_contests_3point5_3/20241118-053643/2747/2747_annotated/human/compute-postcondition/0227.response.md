Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is incremented by 2. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `count` is incremented by 3. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is empty, `count` is incremented by 3**
