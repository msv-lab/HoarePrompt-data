Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `order` is a list. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. In this case, `count` becomes 1, `c` becomes 0, and `order` contains the element at index 0 of list `a`. If `c` is not equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is updated to the remainder of `(int(inp[0]) + 2) divided by len(a) + 1`, and `count` is increased by 1. In this scenario, `count` becomes 1, `c` is set to the new value based on the calculation, and `order` contains the element at index `c` of list `a`.***
