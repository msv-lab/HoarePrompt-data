Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 2.
Output State: **`temp` contains an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 2**
