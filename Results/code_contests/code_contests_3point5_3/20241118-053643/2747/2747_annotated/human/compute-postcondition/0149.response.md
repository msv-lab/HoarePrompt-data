Example Answer:
`temp` is initialized as an empty list. `same` is a list containing the newly appended element `temp[0]`, but since `temp` is empty, it does not have any elements. `lol` contains the element `temp[0][1]`, but `temp` is empty, so it does not have any elements to access. `count` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` is a list containing the newly appended element `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains the element `temp[0][1]`, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`same` is a list containing the newly appended element `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains the element `temp[0][1]`, `count` is 0**
