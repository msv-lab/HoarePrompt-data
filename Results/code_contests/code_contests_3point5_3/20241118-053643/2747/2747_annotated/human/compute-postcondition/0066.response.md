Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. The value of `order` will be the element at index 2 of list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `c` is 2, `order` contains the element at index 2 of list `a`.
Output State: **`count` is 1, `c` is 2, `order` contains the element at index 2 of list `a`**
