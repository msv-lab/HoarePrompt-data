Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k, n × k ≤ 10^6; `l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^18; `ai` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n - 1; `order` contains the elements appended from `a` list up to index `c` or `c + 1` depending on the condition; `same` is an empty list; `a` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace; `c` is either 0, 1 if it was originally equal to len(a) - 1, or incremented by 1, 2 if it was not equal to len(a) - 1; `i` is 0; `inp[1]` is a non-negative integer; `count` is incremented by 3 or 2 depending on the condition***
