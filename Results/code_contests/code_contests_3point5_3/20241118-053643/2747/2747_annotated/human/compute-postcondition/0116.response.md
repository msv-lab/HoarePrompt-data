Example Answer:
The value of `order[i]` and `order[count]` are appended as a list to the `temp` list. The value of `count` is 1, so `temp` will contain a list with the elements `[order[i], order[1]]`. The `lol` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` contains a list with elements `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1**
