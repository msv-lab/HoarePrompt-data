Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer and is increased by 1 after the execution of the program fragment. `c` is an integer that is updated based on the conditions provided. If `c` is equal to len(a) - 1, then `c` is set to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. In this case, `order` contains the element at index 0 of list `a`. If `c` is not equal to len(a) - 1, then `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is increased by 1. In this scenario, `order` contains the element at index `c` of list `a`.***
