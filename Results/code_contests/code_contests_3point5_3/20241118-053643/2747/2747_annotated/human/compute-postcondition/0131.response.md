Output State: **`same` is a list. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` is not in `same` and `lol` is not in `same`, and the length of `same` is equal to the non-negative integer value of `inp[1]`, then the program breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are emptied, and `count` is incremented by 1.**
