Example Answer:
`temp` contains a new list `[order[i], order[2]]`, and `temp[0][1]` references the second element of the first list in `temp`. Since `temp` is `[order[i], order[2]]`, `temp[0]` refers to `order[i]`, and `temp[0][1]` refers to the second element of `order[i]`. `lol` is an empty list, so after appending `temp[0][1]` to `lol`, `lol` will contain the second element of `order[i]`. The value of `count` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` is a list, `temp` is a list containing a new list `[order[i], order[2]]`, `lol` contains the second element of `order[i]`, `count` is 2.
Output State: **`same` is a list, `temp` is a list containing a new list `[order[i], order[2]]`, `lol` contains the second element of `order[i]`, `count` is 2**
