Example Answer: 
An empty list `lol` is assigned to the variable `lol`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp[0][1]` is not defined, `lol` is an empty list, `same` is not defined.
Output State: **`temp[0][1]` is not defined, `lol` is an empty list, `same` is not defined**
