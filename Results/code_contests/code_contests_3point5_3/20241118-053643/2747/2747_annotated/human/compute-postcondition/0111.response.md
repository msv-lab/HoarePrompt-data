Example Answer:
`temp` is initialized as an empty list. `temp[0][1]` is not defined, so appending it to `lol` is not possible. The variable `same` contains the appended value from `temp[0]`, which is also not possible due to the empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp[0][1]` is not defined, `lol` is empty, `same` is not defined.
Output State: **`temp[0][1]` is not defined, `lol` is empty, `same` is not defined**
