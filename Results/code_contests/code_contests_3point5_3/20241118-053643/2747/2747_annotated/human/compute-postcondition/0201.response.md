Output State: **`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` contains a new sublist created from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` holds the element at index 1 of the first sublist in `temp`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, then the loop or if statement is terminated, and `same` now has the newly appended element from `temp[0]`.**
