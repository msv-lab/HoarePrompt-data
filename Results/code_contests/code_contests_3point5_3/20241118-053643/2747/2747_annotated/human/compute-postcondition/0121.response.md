Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 1. After execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is None, `count` is 2.
Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is None, `count` is 2**
