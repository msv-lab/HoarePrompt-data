Example Answer:
The value at `temp[0]` is appended to the list `same`. If the length of `same` becomes equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the program. 
Output State: **`temp[0][1]` is appended to `lol`, `same` contains the appended value from `temp[0]`**
