Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `k` remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k, n × k ≤ 10^6; `l` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^18; `ai` remains positive integers such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n - 1; `order` remains containing the elements appended from `a` list up to index `c` or `c + 1` depending on the condition; `same` remains an empty list; `a` remains a list containing the input values split by whitespace; `c` remains 0; `i` remains 0; `inp[1]` remains a non-negative integer; `count` is incremented by 1.**
