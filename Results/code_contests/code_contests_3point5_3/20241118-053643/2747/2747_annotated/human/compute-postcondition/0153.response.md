According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `count` and the length of the list `order`. If `count` is less than or equal to the length of `order` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `count` is 1, it needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `count` should be adjusted to 2.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`same` is a list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 2**
