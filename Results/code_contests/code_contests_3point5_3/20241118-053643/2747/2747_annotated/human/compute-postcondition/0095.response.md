Output State: **`same` contains `[[order[0], order[0]]]`; `order` contains elements from a list up to index `c`; `c` is either 0 or incremented by 1; `i` is 0; `inp[1]` is a non-negative integer; `count` is 0; `temp` contains `[[order[0], order[0]]]`; `lol` contains the value of `[order[0], order[0], order[0]]`; temp[0] and lol are not in `same`; The length of `same` is equal to the non-negative integer value of `inp[1]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `inp[1]`, the program execution breaks.**
