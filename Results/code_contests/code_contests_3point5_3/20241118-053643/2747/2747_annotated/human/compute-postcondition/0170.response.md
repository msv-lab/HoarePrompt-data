Example Answer:
`temp` contains `[order[i], order[4]]`, where `order[i]` and `order[4]` are elements of the list `order`. `temp[0][1]` accesses the second element of the first element in `temp`. The value of `temp[0][1]` is appended to the list `lol`. The initial state of the variables is `same` is a list, `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[4]]`, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 4.
Output State: **`same` is a list, `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[4]]`, `lol` is a list containing the second element of the first element in `temp`, `count` is 4**
