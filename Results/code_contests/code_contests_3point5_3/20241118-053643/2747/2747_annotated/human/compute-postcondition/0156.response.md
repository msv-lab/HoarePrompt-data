Example Answer: 
The `lol` list appends the first element of the first list in the `temp` list, which is the same as `order[i]`. Since `temp` contains a new list `[order[i], order[2]]`, appending the first element of the first list results in adding `order[i]` to `lol`. The `lol` list now contains the second element of `order[i]` and `order[i]`. The `count` remains 2 and does not change.
Output State: **`same` is a list, `temp` is a list containing a new list `[order[i], order[2]]`, `lol` contains the second element of `order[i]` and `order[i]`, `count` is 2**
