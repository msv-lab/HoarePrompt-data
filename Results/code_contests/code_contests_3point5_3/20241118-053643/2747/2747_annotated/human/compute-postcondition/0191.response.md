Example Answer:
The element at index 1 of the first sublist in `temp` is appended to the list `lol`. The content of `same`, `temp`, and `order` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` contains elements based on conditions, `temp` contains a new sublist based on `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in `temp`.
Output State: **`same` contains elements based on conditions, `temp` contains a new sublist based on `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in `temp`**
