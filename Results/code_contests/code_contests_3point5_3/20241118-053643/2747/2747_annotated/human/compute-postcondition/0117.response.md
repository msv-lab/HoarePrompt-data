Example Answer: 
`temp` contains a list with elements `[order[i], order[1]]`, and after executing the code, the element at index 1 of the first element of `temp` is appended to the list `lol`. Since the initial state is not provided with the values of `order[i]` and `order[1]`, the output state will be: `temp` contains a list with elements `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` contains the second element of the first element in `temp`, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`temp` contains a list with elements `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` contains the second element of the first element in `temp`, `count` is 1**
