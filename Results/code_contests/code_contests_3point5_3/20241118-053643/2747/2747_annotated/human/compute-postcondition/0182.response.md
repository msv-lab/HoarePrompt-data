Postcondition: ***`same` is a list. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` become empty lists, and `count` is increased by 1, resulting in `count` being 5. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value present in `inp[1]`, the program terminates. If neither of these conditions is met, the element at `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, with `count` being incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 5. In all cases, the final state after the if else block is `same` being a list containing elements based on the conditions met, `temp` and `lol` being empty lists, and `count` being 5.***
