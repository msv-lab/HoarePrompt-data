Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer less than or equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1; `c` is an integer that can vary depending on the initial values of `c` and `count`. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is set to 0 and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `count` is increased by 1. This logic ensures that `count` is incremented with every execution, and `c` is iteratively updated according to the conditions provided in the if-else block.***
