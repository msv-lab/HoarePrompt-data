Postcondition: ***`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp`, `lol` are set to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1. If `len(same)` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp` is set to an empty list, `lol` is set to an empty list, `count` is incremented by 1, and `temp[0]` is appended to `same`.***
