Postcondition: ***`same` is a list, `temp` is a list containing a new list `[order[i], order[2]]`, `lol` contains the second element of `order[i]` and `order[i]`, `count` is 2. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.***
