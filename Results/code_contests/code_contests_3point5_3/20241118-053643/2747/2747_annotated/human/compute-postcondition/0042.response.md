Output State: **n, l, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k, n × k ≤ 10^6; l is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^18; ai are positive integers such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n - 1; order contains the elements appended from a list up to index c; same is an empty list; a is a list containing the input values split by whitespace; c is either 0 if it was originally equal to len(a) - 1, or it is incremented by 1 if it was not equal to len(a) - 1; i is incremented by 1; inp[1] is a non-negative integer; count is incremented by 1; count is 2; if c == len(a) - 1, then c is assigned the value 0 and count is incremented by 1. If c is not equal to len(a) - 1, then c is incremented by 1 and count is incremented by 1**
