Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. `count` was previously unknown, so after execution, `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1**
