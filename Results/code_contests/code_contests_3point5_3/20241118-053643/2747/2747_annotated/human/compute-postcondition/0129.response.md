Postcondition: ***`temp` contains an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 2. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp`, `lol`, and `count` are reset to empty list, None, and 2 respectively. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, the execution breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp`, `lol`, and `count` are reset to empty list, empty list, and 2 respectively.***
