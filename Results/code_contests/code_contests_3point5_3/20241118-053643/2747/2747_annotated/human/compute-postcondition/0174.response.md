Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 4. After execution, `count` becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` is a list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 5.
Output State: **`same` is a list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 5**
