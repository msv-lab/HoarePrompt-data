Postcondition: ***`same` is a list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is an integer value of 3. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp`, `lol`, and `count` are reset to empty list, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement, otherwise `same` is appended with the new list `[order[i], order[2]]`, `temp`, `lol`, and `count` are reset to empty list, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
