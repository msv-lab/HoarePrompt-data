Example Answer:
The list `temp` appends a sublist containing elements from the `order` list at indices `i` and `count`. The states of `same` and `lol` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` contains elements based on conditions, `temp` contains a new sublist based on `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`same` contains elements based on conditions, `temp` contains a new sublist based on `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` is an empty list**
