Example Answer:
`lol` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are `same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is empty, `lol` is empty, `count` is incremented by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 2**
