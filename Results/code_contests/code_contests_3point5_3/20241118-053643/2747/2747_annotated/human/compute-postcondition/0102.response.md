Example Answer:
`temp[0][1]` is appended to `lol`. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1, and `temp` appends `[order[i], order[count]]`. 
Output State: **If `temp[0][1]` is appended to `lol`, and if `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1, and `temp` appends `[order[i], order[count]]`**
