Postcondition: ***`same` is a list, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1. If either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp`, `lol`, `count` are reset and increased by 1 respectively. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the non-negative integer value of `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp`, `lol`, `count` are reset and increased by 1.***
