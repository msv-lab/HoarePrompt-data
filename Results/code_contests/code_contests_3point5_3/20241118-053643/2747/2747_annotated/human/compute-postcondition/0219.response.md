Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 2**
