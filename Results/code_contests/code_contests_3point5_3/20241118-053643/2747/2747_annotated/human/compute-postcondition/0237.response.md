Output State: **`same` contains elements based on certain conditions. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is already present in `same`, then `temp`, `lol` are emptied, and `count` is incremented accordingly based on the number of repetitions. If the length of `same` becomes equal to the integer value in `inp[1]`, the program breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp`, `lol` are emptied, and `count` is incremented based on the number of iterations. If `count` exceeds `len(order) - 1`, the loop terminates.**
