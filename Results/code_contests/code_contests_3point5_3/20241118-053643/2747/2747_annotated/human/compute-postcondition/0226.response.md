Example Answer:
The list `lol` is assigned an empty list, so the previous values of `same`, `temp`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is empty, `count` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is empty, `count` is incremented by 2**
