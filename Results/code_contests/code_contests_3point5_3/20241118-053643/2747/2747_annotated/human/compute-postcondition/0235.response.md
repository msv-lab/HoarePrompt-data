Postcondition: ***`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is either an empty list or a list containing elements based on certain conditions, `count` is incremented by 3. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp`, `lol` are emptied, `count` is increased by 3. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp`, `lol` are emptied, and `count` is increased by 3.***
