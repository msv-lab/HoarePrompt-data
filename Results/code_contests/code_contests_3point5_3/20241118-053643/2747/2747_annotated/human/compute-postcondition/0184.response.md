Output State: **If the length of `order` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. If the length of `same` becomes equal to the non-negative integer value of `inp[1]`, the loop will break. Otherwise, after the loop finishes executing, `same` will contain a list of elements based on the conditions met during the iterations, `temp` and `lol` will be empty lists, and `count` will be the value of 5**
