Postcondition: ***`same` contains elements based on certain conditions. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` is emptied, `lol` is emptied, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value in `inp[1]`, the program breaks. Otherwise, `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is emptied, `lol` is emptied, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
