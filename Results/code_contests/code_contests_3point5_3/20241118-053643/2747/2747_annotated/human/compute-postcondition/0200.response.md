Postcondition: ***`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` contains a new sublist created from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` holds the element at index 1 of the first sublist in `temp`. The program variables retain their initial conditions. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, then the loop or if statement is terminated. The postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios for the program variables after the execution of the if statement.***
