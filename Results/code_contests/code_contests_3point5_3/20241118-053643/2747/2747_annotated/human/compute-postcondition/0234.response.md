Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is incremented by 2. After execution, `count` is incremented by 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 3.
Output State: **`same` contains elements based on certain conditions, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 3**
