Example Answer:
`lol` is reassigned to an empty list. The previous value of `lol` is an empty list, so after execution, `lol` remains an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`temp` contains an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1**
