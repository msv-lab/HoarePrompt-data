Correctness: **False**

The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The code does not calculate the number of subsequences of array `b` that are non-decreasing and have a length between 1 and `k`. Instead, the code seems to be generating combinations of elements from array `a` and checking for duplicates, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Additionally, the code has some issues such as using `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3, using `%` for modulo operation instead of `pow(10, 9) + 7` as mentioned in the problem description, and not handling the input format correctly.

Overall, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement in order to produce the correct output.
