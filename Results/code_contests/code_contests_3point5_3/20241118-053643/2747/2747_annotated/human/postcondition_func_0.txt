The function `func` reads user input, processes it to generate combinations, and prints the sum of the length of the combinations and the order list modulo 10^9 + 7. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The annotations provide details on variable states and loop iterations, but the actual functionality involves creating combinations and calculating the sum modulo a specific value.
