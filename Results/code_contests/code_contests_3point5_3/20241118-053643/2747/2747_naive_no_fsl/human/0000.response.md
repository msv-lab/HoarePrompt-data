Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It is difficult to pinpoint a specific case where the program fails as the logic itself is flawed. The program seems to be attempting to generate subsequences of array `b` that are non-decreasing, but the implementation is incorrect. Additionally, the program does not take into account the modulo 10^9 + 7 requirement mentioned in the problem description.

To correct the program, a different approach is needed to generate all possible subsequences of `b` that satisfy the given conditions. A more systematic way of counting such subsequences is required.
