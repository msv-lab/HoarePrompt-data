Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, checks if there are conflicting topics between connected blogs, and then outputs the order in which Johnny should write the blogs. The logic provided in the program follows the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` correctly determines if there is a valid ordering for Johnny to write the blogs based on the given topics. The program handles the cases where a solution does not exist by returning -1. Overall, the program seems to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.
