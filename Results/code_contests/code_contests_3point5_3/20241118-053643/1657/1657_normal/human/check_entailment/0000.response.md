Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`.
- It iterates through each tuple (a, b) in `arr` and checks if the topics at indices `a` and `b` in the `topic` list are equal. 
- If any pair of topics is equal, the function returns -1 as expected.
- Otherwise, it returns a string containing numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code seems to correctly implement the strategy of choosing topics for Johnny's blogs based on the desired topic numbers and the references between the blogs. 
- The output hints also confirm this behavior by explaining that the function checks for duplicate topics in the `arr` list and returns -1 if found, or returns a string of numbers from 1 to n if no duplicates are present.
