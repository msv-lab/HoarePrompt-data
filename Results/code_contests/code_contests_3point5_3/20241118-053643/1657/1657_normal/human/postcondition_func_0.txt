The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. It iterates through each tuple (a, b) in `arr` and checks if the topics at indices a and b in the `topic` list are equal. If any pair of topics is equal, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns a string containing numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces. The functionality is to detect duplicate topics in the `arr` list and return -1 if found, or return a string of numbers from 1 to n if no duplicates are present.
