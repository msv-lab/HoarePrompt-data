The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. **Precondition**: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 5 * 10^5. `arr` is a list of m tuples containing integers a and b where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n. `topic` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the desired topic number of the corresponding blog (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n).

After executing the function body, if there are any pairs of indices `a` and `b` in `arr` such that the topics at those indices are equal, the function returns -1. Otherwise, if there are no such pairs, the loop does not execute, and the state remains the same. Additionally, the program returns a string containing numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to check for any duplicate topics in the `arr` list and return -1 if duplicates are found. If no duplicates are found, the function returns a string containing numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.
