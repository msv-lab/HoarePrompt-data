Output State: **`topic` is a list of desired topic numbers for blogs. If there are any pairs of indices `a` and `b` in `arr` such that the topics at those indices are equal, the function returns -1. Otherwise, no change is made to the state of the program variables. If there are no such pairs, the loop does not execute and the state remains the same.**
