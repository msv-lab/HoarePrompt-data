According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements at index `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list. If these elements are not equal, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the comparison was made between the elements at index `a - 1` and `b - 1`. If these elements were equal, the function would have returned -1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the elements at index `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list must not be equal.
State: **`topic` is a list, where the elements at index `a - 1` and `b - 1` are not equal.**
