You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today Johnny wants to increase his contribution. His plan assumes writing n blogs. One blog covers one topic, but one topic can be covered by many blogs. Moreover, some blogs have references to each other. Each pair of blogs that are connected by a reference has to cover different topics because otherwise, the readers can notice that they are split just for more contribution. Set of blogs and bidirectional references between some pairs of them is called blogs network.

There are n different topics, numbered from 1 to n sorted by Johnny's knowledge. The structure of the blogs network is already prepared. Now Johnny has to write the blogs in some order. He is lazy, so each time before writing a blog, he looks at it's already written neighbors (the blogs referenced to current one) and chooses the topic with the smallest number which is not covered by neighbors. It's easy to see that this strategy will always allow him to choose a topic because there are at most n - 1 neighbors.

For example, if already written neighbors of the current blog have topics number 1, 3, 1, 5, and 2, Johnny will choose the topic number 4 for the current blog, because topics number 1, 2 and 3 are already covered by neighbors and topic number 4 isn't covered.

As a good friend, you have done some research and predicted the best topic for each blog. Can you tell Johnny, in which order he has to write the blogs, so that his strategy produces the topic assignment chosen by you?

Input

The first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) and m (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of blogs and references, respectively.

Each of the following m lines contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b; 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n), which mean that there is a reference between blogs a and b. It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain multiple edges.

The last line contains n integers t_1, t_2, …, t_n, i-th of them denotes desired topic number of the i-th blog (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n).

Output

If the solution does not exist, then write -1. Otherwise, output n distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), which describe the numbers of blogs in order which Johnny should write them. If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note

In the first example, Johnny starts with writing blog number 2, there are no already written neighbors yet, so it receives the first topic. Later he writes blog number 1, it has reference to the already written second blog, so it receives the second topic. In the end, he writes blog number 3, it has references to blogs number 1 and 2 so it receives the third topic.

Second example: There does not exist any permutation fulfilling given conditions.

Third example: First Johnny writes blog 2, it receives the topic 1. Then he writes blog 5, it receives the topic 1 too because it doesn't have reference to single already written blog 2. Then he writes blog number 1, it has reference to blog number 2 with topic 1, so it receives the topic 2. Then he writes blog number 3 which has reference to blog 2, so it receives the topic 2. Then he ends with writing blog number 4 which has reference to blog 5 and receives the topic 2.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(n, m, arr, topic):
    for (a, b) in arr:
        if topic[a - 1] == topic[b - 1]:
            return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the topic number of blogs a and b are the same at any iteration, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state. If arr is empty, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the program state.
    return ' '.join([str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    #The program returns a string containing numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
