Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if there are any blogs with the same topic number among the connected blogs.

Otherwise, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n, which represents the order in which Johnny should write the blogs. The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, ensuring that each blog's topic choice is based on the topics of its neighbors. The function handles the given inputs as per the problem description and provides the correct output.
