Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. It iterates through pairs of blogs represented by tuples in `arr` and checks if their corresponding topics in the `topic` list are the same. If the topics are the same at any iteration, the function returns -1. If `arr` is empty or all pairs have different topics, the function returns a string containing numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.**
