The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. `n` represents the number of blogs, `m` represents the number of references, `arr` is a list of tuples representing references between blogs, and `topic` is a list of integers representing the desired topic number for each blog. The topics are integers from 1 to n, and each tuple in `arr` contains two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n` and `a` ≠ `b`.

After executing the function body, the function behaves as follows:
- Case 1: If the topic number of blogs `a` and `b` are the same at any iteration, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the program state.
- Case 2: The program returns a string containing numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`, and based on the conditions described above, return either -1 or a string containing numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.
