According to the code, the loop can execute again if there is at least one more tuple in the arr. At the end of the last iteration, n and m are integers greater than or equal to 1, arr contains at least one tuple with two integers a and b, topic is a list of integers. To execute the loop one more time, arr should contain at least one more tuple with two integers other than a and b. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n and m are integers greater than or equal to 1. arr contains at least two tuples with two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. topic is a list of integers representing the desired topic number for each blog.**
