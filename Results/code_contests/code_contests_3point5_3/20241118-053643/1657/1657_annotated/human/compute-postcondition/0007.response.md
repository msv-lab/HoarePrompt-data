According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the elements in the `arr` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `arr` contains at least two tuples with two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. To execute the loop one more time, you need to adjust the `arr` list to contain at least one more tuple with two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n and m are integers greater than or equal to 1. arr contains at least three tuples with two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. topic is a list of integers representing the desired topic number for each blog. If the topic number at index a-1 is equal to the topic number at index b-1, the function returns -1.**
