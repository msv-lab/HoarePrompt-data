According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the arr list. If the list has at least four tuples, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, arr contains at least three tuples with two integers a and b. So for the loop to be executed one more time, arr must contain at least four tuples. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n and m are integers greater than or equal to 1. arr contains at least four tuples with two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. topic is a list of integers representing the desired topic number for each blog. If the topic number at index a-1 is equal to the topic number at index b-1, the function returns -1.**
