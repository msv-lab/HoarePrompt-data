The function func_14 accepts two integer parameters, x and y. If x is divisible by y without a remainder, it returns the result of x divided by y. Otherwise, it returns the result of the integer division of x by y plus 1. The function does not handle the case where y is 0, which could potentially lead to a division by zero error.
