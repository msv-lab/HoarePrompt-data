Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are assigned using the `pop` method with default values ' ' and `sys.stdout` respectively. The `pop` method removes and returns an item from a dictionary based on the key provided. If the key is not found, the default values are used. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`**
