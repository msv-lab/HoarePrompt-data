Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `b` contains elements from list `a` based on the conditions in the program fragment, `f` is toggled between 0 and 1. If `f` was initially 0, elements are added to `b` from `a` starting at index `j` and moving towards index 0, decrementing `j` and toggling `f` to 1. If `f` was initially 1, elements are added to `b` from `a` starting at index 0 and moving towards index `n-1`, incrementing `i` and toggling `f` to 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `b` remains empty, `i`, `j`, `k` are 0, and `f` is 0.**
