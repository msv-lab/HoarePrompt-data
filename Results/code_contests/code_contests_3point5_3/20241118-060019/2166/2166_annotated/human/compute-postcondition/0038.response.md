Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains 1, `j` remains 0, `k` remains 0, `f` remains 0, and `b` contains elements from list `a` satisfying specific conditions. The element at index `i` in list `b` is less than the elements at index `i - 1` and `i + 1` in list `b.***
