Example Answer:
The value of `f` is toggled between 0 and 1. Since the initial state is not provided for `f`, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. Therefore, the output state is: The value of `j` is decremented by 1; `f` is toggled between 0 and 1.
Output State: **The value of `j` is decremented by 1; `f` is toggled between 0 and 1**
