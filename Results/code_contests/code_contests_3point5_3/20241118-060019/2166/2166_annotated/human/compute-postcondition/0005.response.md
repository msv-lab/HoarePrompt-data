Example Answer: 
The `write` method of the `file` object is called with the `sep` parameter, which is a space character. This will write a space to the standard output. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `args`**
