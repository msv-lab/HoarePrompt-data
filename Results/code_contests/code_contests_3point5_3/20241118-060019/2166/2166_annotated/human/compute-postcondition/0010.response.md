Example Answer:
The `write` method of the `file` object is called with the value of `sep`, which is a space character ' '. The `at_start` variable remains False, `args` is still not empty, and `x` is still the second element in `args`. Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, and `x` is the second element in `args`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, and `x` is the second element in `args`**
