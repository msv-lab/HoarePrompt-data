Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, and `x` is the second element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, then the `sep` is written to the `file`. Otherwise, no action is taken. The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the `file`.**
