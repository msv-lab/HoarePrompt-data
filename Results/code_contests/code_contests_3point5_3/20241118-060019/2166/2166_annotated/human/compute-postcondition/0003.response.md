According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `args` is not empty and `x` is the first element in `args`.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, `args` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `args`**
