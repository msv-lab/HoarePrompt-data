Postcondition: ***If args is not empty, the loop writes the elements of args to the file separated by sep. at_start is False after the loop executes. If args is empty, the loop does not execute, and at_start remains True. If kwargs has the key 'flush' and its value is True, then the file is flushed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
