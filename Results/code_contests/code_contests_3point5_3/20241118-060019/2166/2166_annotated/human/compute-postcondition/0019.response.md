According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `args` list. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, and `x` is the third element in `args`. To execute the loop one more time, `x` needs to be the fourth element in `args`.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, and `x` is the fourth element in `args`**
