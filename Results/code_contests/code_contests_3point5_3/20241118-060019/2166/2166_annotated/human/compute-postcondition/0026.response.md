Functionality: **The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args` and writes them to a file, separated by `sep`. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute. It then writes the value of 'end' from `kwargs` to the file, defaulting to a newline if 'end' is not present. If the key 'flush' in `kwargs` is True, the file is flushed. The return value of the function is not explicitly specified in the given information.**
