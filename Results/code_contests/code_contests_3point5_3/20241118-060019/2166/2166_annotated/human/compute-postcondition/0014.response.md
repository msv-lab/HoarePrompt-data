According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, and `x` is the second element in `args`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `args` list must have more elements and the value of `x` should be the third element in the list. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, and `x` is the third element in `args`**
