Postcondition: ***`n`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `f` are integers. If `f` is 0, `b` contains the elements from list `a` based on the conditions in the program fragment, the value of `j` is decremented by 1, and `f` is toggled to 1. If `f` is 1, `b` contains the elements from list `a` based on the conditions in the program fragment, the value of `i` is increased by 1, and `f` is toggled to 0. The values of `i` and `j` are updated accordingly based on whether `f` was 0 or 1 before the execution of the program fragment.***
