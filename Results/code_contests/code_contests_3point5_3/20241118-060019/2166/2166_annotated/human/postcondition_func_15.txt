The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the ice sphere prices represented by `x` and `y`. If `n` is 1, it returns the price of the only ice sphere. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns the GCD of all ice sphere prices. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function does not execute the loop and returns 0.
