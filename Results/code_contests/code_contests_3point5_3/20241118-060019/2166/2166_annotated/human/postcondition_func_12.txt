The function `func_13` accepts two parameters: `n` and `r`. The function calculates and returns the value of nCr, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and r is a positive integer less than or equal to n. The code efficiently computes the combination value using the factorial function. However, the code does not handle cases where n or r are negative, non-integer values, or where r is greater than n. These edge cases should be considered for a complete functionality summary.
