The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n`. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1. It returns True if `n` is greater than 1 but less than or equal to 3. If `n` is greater than 1 but not divisible by 2 or 3, it returns True. Additionally, if `n` is not divisible by 2, 3, or any number in the form of `i` or `i + 2` where `i` is the next multiple of 6 after each iteration, it returns True. In all other cases, the function returns True.
