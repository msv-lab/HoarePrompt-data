The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of positive integers after applying `func_3()` on each element of list 'a'. The code does not actually have a function `func_3` defined, so it will result in a NameError when executed. Therefore, the actual functionality is to return a list from the non-existent function `func_3`, leading to an error.
