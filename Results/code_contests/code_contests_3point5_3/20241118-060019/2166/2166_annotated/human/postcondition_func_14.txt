The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `p` is a list of positive integers. It iterates through the list of prices `p` and calculates the final value of 'res' after all iterations. The function performs modular arithmetic operations on `x` and `y` based on the binary representation of `y`.
