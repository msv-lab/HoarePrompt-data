Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program is supposed to find the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy by reordering the ice spheres such that the cheap ice spheres are in the optimal order. However, the implementation of the program does not handle this correctly.

The program does not reorder the ice spheres based on the given conditions in the problem statement, and the logic in function `func_19` does not accurately determine the maximum number of ice spheres Sage can buy.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness of the program false.
