The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. Parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of ice spheres in the shop, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of copies of each price, and `num` is a list of distinct positive integers representing the prices of the ice spheres. The function then generates a 2D list where each row contains 'm' copies of the respective price of the ice sphere. The total number of rows in the 2D list is 'n', representing the number of ice spheres in the shop.
