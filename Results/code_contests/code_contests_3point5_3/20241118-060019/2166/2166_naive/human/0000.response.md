Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reorders the ice spheres in a way that the maximum number of cheap ice spheres can be bought by Sage. It first reads the input, then iterates through the ice spheres and alternates between adding the ice sphere with the highest price to the left and right of the reordered list. Finally, it checks for cheap ice spheres by comparing each ice sphere's price with its neighboring ice spheres. The logic of the program seems correct and there are no apparent edge cases where it would fail to provide the maximum number of cheap ice spheres.
