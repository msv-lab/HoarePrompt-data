The function `func_14` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It divides `x` by `y` and returns the integer result if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of `x` divided by `y`, rounded up to the nearest integer. The function handles the case where `y` is 0 as it would result in a `ZeroDivisionError` in Python, which is not explicitly addressed in the annotations.
