According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 3. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 4, `f`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are defined in a manner that the loop body can be executed successfully, `ans` is an integer**
