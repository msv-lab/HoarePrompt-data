Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. Since there are no other variables affected and their values are not provided, the output state is: n is a positive integer. All prices a_i are positive integers, and all prices are different; `at_start` is True.
Output State: **n is a positive integer. All prices a_i are positive integers, and all prices are different; `at_start` is True**
