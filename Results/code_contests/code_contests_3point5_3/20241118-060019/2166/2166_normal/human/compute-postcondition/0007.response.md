Example Answer: 
The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since there is no information given about the initial value of `x`, we can't determine the specific value being written. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the value of `x` at the time of execution.
Output State: **Dependent on the value of `x` at the time of execution**
