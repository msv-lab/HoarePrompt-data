Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file. The state of `at_start` is not affected if it is True. If `at_start` is False, the program writes `sep` to the file before writing `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is a boolean, `x` is written to the file as a string.
Output State: **`at_start` is a boolean, `x` is written to the file as a string**
