Example Answer: 
The value of `f` is toggled to its opposite value, which means if `f` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `f` was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is either `n - 4` or `n - 3` decreased by 1, `f` is toggled to the opposite value, `b` contains elements from `a[j]` or `a[i]` based on the updated value of `f`, `k` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is either `n - 4` or `n - 3` decreased by 1, `f` is toggled to the opposite value, `b` contains elements from `a[j]` or `a[i]` based on the updated value of `f`, `k` is increased by 1**
