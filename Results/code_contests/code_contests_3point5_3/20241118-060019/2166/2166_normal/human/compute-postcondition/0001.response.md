Example Answer: 
The code snippet `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` assigns the value of the key 'sep' from the kwargs dictionary to the variable `sep` with a default value of ' ' if the key is not found. It also assigns the value of the key 'file' from the kwargs dictionary to the variable `file` with a default value of `sys.stdout` if the key is not found. Since the initial state does not mention any kwargs dictionary, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer. All prices a_i are positive integers, and all prices are different.**
