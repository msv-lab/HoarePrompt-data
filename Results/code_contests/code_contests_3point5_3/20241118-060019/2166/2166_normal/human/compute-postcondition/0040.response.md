Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so after execution, `ans` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `f`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are defined in a manner that the loop body can be executed successfully, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `f`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are defined in a manner that the loop body can be executed successfully, `ans` is incremented by 1**
