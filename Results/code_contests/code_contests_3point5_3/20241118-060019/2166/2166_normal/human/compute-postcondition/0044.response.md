Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `f`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are defined in a manner that the loop body can be executed successfully, `ans` is an integer. If the condition `b[i] < b[i - 1] and b[i] < b[i + 1]` is met, then `ans` is incremented by 1. No changes occur if the condition is not satisfied.***
