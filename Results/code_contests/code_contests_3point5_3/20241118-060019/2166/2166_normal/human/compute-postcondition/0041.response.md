Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `f`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are defined in a manner that the loop body can be executed successfully, `ans` is an integer. If `b[i]` is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program variables.***
