Functionality: **The function doesn't accept any parameters and writes elements in `args` to a file separated by 'sep'. If `args` is empty, nothing is written. It then writes the value of 'end' from `kwargs` to the file, defaulting to a newline. If 'flush' is a key in `kwargs` and its value is True, the function calls `file.flush()`.**
