According to the code, the loop can execute if there are elements in the `args` list. Since `at_start` is True, it does not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `args` list must have at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer, all prices a_i are positive integers, all prices are different, and `args` is a non-empty list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, all prices a_i are positive integers, all prices are different, `at_start` is True, `args` is a non-empty list**
