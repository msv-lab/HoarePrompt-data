According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in the args. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. As `at_start` being False does not impact the loop execution, no adjustments are needed for `at_start`. The only adjustment needed is to ensure there are more elements in `args` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`at_start` is False**
