According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 to satisfy the condition `i < n - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted based on the information provided.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `f`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are defined in a manner that the loop body can be executed successfully, `ans` is an integer**
