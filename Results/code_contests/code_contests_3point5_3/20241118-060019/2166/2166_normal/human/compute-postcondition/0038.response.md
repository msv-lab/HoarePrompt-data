Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` starts from 1, `f`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are defined in a manner that the loop body can be executed successfully. If `b[i]` is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. The state of the program after the if statement will have `ans` increased by 1 if the condition is met. However, if the condition is not satisfied, `ans` remains unchanged.***
