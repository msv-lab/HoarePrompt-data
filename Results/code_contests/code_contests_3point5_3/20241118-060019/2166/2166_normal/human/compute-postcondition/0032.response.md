Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `j` is either `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `f` is toggled to the opposite value, `b` contains elements from `a[j]` or `a[i]` based on the updated value of `f`, `k` is increased by 1. If `f` is initially 0, `b` appends the element at index `j` from list `a`, `j` is decreased by 1. If `f` is initially 1, `b` appends the element at index `i` from list `a`, `i` is increased by 1.***
