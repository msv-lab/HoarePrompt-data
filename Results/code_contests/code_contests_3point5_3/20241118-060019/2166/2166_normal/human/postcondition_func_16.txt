The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns different outputs based on specific conditions:
- Case 1: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False.
- Case 2: If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns True.
- Case 3: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns True. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns False.
- Case 4: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns True. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns False. The function also checks if `n` is divisible by 5 or 7. If it is, the function returns False. The loop within the function continues to check divisibility by 11 and updates the value of `i` accordingly.
- Case 5: The function returns True.
