The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`, both positive integers. It calculates and returns the number of combinations of choosing `r` ice spheres from `n` ice spheres using the formula for combinations. The functionality does not handle edge cases where `n` or `r` are negative or non-integer values, nor does it account for potential errors related to calculating factorials.
