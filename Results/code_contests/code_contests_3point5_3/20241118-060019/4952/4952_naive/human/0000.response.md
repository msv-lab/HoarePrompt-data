Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly decodes the word encoded by Polycarp as described in the problem statement. The program reads the input, iterates through the encoded string correctly to extract the characters in the correct order, and then prints the decoded word. It handles both odd and even length encoded words by correctly identifying the positions of the characters to be extracted. The program follows the encoding and decoding process described in the problem statement for every potential case, making it correct.
