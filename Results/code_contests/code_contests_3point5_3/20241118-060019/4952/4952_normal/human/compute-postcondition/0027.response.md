According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is even and `i` is less than `n+1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is even, `i` is less than `n+1` and `ns` is updated based on the value of `s[i+1]`**
