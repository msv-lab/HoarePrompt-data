Example Answer: 
The value of `ns` is appended with the value of `s` at index `i`. The previous state of `ns` is an empty string and the previous state of `s` is a list containing input values. After execution, the value of `ns` will be the value at index `i` in the list `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list containing the input values, `ns` is the value at index `i` in the list `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a list containing the input values, `ns` is the value at index `i` in the list `s`**
