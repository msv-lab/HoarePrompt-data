Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decreased by 2, and the previous value of `i` is greater than or equal to 2. The value of `ns` is updated with the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `i` is decreased by 2 and greater than or equal to 2, `ns` is updated with the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s`.
Output State: **variable `i` is decreased by 2 and greater than or equal to 2, `ns` is updated with the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s`**
