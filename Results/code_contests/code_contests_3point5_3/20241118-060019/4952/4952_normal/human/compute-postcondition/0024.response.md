According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is even and `i` is less than `n`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n` after the modification. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is even, `i` is less than `n+1`, and `ns` is updated based on the value of `s[i]`**
