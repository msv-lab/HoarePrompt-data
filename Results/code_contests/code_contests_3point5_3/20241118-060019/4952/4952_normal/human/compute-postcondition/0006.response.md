According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decreased by 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to 2.
State: **variable `i` is decreased by 2 and `i` is greater than or equal to 2**
