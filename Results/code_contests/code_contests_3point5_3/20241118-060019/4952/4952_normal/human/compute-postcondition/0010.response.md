Example Answer:
The value of `ns` is updated by adding the character at index `i` of string `s`. Since `i` is greater than or equal to 4, the character added to `ns` is `s[4]`. Therefore, the output state is: variable `i` is greater than or equal to 4, `ns` is updated with the character at index 4 of string `s`.
Output State: **variable `i` is greater than or equal to 4, `ns` is updated with the character at index 4 of string `s`**
