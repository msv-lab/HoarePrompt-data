Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `i` is less than `n`, and since `n` is even, the updated value of `i` is also less than `n`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is even, `i` is less than `n`, and `ns` is updated based on the value of `s[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is even, `i` is less than `n`, and `ns` is updated based on the value of `s[i]**.
