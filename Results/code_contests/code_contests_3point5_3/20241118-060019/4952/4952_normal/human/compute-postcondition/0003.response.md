Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the value `n - 2`, but the initial value of `n` is unknown, so the value of `i` cannot be determined. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list containing the input values, `ns` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a list containing the input values, `ns` is an empty string**
