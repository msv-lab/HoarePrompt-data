Example Answer:
The input function takes a user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the input is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `n` or `s`. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the encoded word. s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the encoded word. s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.**
