Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. It then constructs a new string `ns` by selecting characters at every 2nd index from the end of the string `s`. If the input integer `n` is odd, the final constructed string `ns` will be empty. If `n` is even, `ns` will be updated with characters from `s` at every 2nd index from the end of the list. The function prints the final constructed string `ns` after the operations.**
