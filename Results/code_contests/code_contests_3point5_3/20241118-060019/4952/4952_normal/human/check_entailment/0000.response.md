Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. 

The code is supposed to decode an encoded word by selecting characters at every 2nd index from the end of the string and constructing a new string. However, the code does not work correctly for all cases. 

For example, if we take the input: 
```
4
abba
```

The expected output should be "baba" as per the problem description. However, the code will output "ab" for this input, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the code is not correct for all potential cases and hence the Correctness is **False**.
