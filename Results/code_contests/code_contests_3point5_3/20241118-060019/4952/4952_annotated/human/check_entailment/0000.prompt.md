You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is mad about coding, that is why he writes Sveta encoded messages. He calls the median letter in a word the letter which is in the middle of the word. If the word's length is even, the median letter is the left of the two middle letters. In the following examples, the median letter is highlighted: contest, info. If the word consists of single letter, then according to above definition this letter is the median letter. 

Polycarp encodes each word in the following way: he writes down the median letter of the word, then deletes it and repeats the process until there are no letters left. For example, he encodes the word volga as logva.

You are given an encoding s of some word, your task is to decode it. 

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the length of the encoded word.

The second line contains the string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters — the encoding.

Output

Print the word that Polycarp encoded.

Examples

Input

5
logva


Output

volga


Input

2
no


Output

no


Input

4
abba


Output

baba

Note

In the first example Polycarp encoded the word volga. At first, he wrote down the letter l from the position 3, after that his word looked like voga. After that Polycarp wrote down the letter o from the position 2, his word became vga. Then Polycarp wrote down the letter g which was at the second position, the word became va. Then he wrote down the letter v, then the letter a. Thus, the encoding looked like logva.

In the second example Polycarp encoded the word no. He wrote down the letter n, the word became o, and he wrote down the letter o. Thus, in this example, the word and its encoding are the same.

In the third example Polycarp encoded the word baba. At first, he wrote down the letter a, which was at the position 2, after that the word looked like bba. Then he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 2, his word looked like ba. After that he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 1, the word looked like a, and he wrote down that letter a. Thus, the encoding is abba.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = list(raw_input())
    ns = ''
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ns += s[i]
        
        i -= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If the input value is greater or equal to 2, `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices  n-2, n-4, n-6, ... , 3, 1 in that order, `i` is either 0 or -1. If the input value is less than 2, the loop doesn't execute, and `ns` remains an empty string, `i` is initially 2 less than the input value.
    if (n % 2) :
        i = 0
    else :
        i = 1
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If the input value is greater or equal to 2, `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1 in that order; `i` is either 0 or -1. If the input value is less than 2, `ns` remains an empty string; `i` is initially 2 less than the input value. After the if-else block executes, if n is odd, `ns` is an empty string and `i` is set to 0. If n is even, `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1 in that order, and `i` is either 0 or -1 based on the value of n.
    while i < n:
        ns += s[i]
        
        i += 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If n is odd, `ns` is an empty string and `i` is 0. If n is even, `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1 in that order, and `i` is either 2 or 1 based on the value of n.
    print(ns)

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
