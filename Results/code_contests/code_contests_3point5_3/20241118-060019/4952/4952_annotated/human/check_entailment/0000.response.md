Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly decodes the encoded word based on the given problem description. It first reads the input values, then iterates over the characters in the input string starting from the second last character in reverse order and concatenates them to form the decoded word. It then handles cases where the length of the input word is odd or even to correctly decode the word. Finally, it prints the decoded word which matches the expected output. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and works as expected.
