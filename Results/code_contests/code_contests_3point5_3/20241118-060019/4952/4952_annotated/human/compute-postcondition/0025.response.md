Example Answer:
The character at index `i` in string `s` is concatenated to the string `ns`. The value of `i` has been adjusted to `n-1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1, and the value of `i` is adjusted to n-1.
Output State: **`ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1; `i` is adjusted to n-1**
