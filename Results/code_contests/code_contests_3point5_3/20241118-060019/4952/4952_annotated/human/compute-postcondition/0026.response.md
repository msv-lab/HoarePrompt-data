Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 2, and the previous value of `i` was adjusted to n-1. Therefore, after execution, `i` will be n+1. The variable `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1 and is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1; `i` is adjusted to n+1**
