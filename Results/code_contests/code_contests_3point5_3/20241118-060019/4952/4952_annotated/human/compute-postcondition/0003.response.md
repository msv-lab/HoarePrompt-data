Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value of `n - 2`. The value of `n` is initially assigned the input value, so the value of `i` will be 2 less than the input value. The other variables `s` and `ns` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is an empty string, `i` is 2 less than the input value.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is an empty string, `i` is 2 less than the input value**
