Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `i` is greater than 0, so after execution, `i` will have a value less than the initial value by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` contains the concatenated characters up to index `i-2`, and `i` is now a value less than the initial value by 2.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` contains the concatenated characters up to index `i-2`, and `i` is now a value less than the initial value by 2**
