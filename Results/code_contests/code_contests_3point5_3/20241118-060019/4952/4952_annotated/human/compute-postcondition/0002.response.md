Example Answer: 
`ns` is assigned an empty string. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is an empty string**
