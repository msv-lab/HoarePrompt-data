Example Answer:
The character at index `n-2` in the list `s` is concatenated with the character at index `i` in the list `s` and stored back in `ns`. The previous values of `n`, `s`, `ns`, and `i` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` contains the concatenated characters, and `i` is equal to or greater than 2.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` contains the concatenated characters, and `i` is equal to or greater than 2**
