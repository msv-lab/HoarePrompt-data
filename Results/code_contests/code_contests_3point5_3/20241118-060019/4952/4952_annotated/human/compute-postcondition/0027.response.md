According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1 and `i` is adjusted to n+1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to n+2.
State: **`ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1 and `i` is adjusted to n+2**
