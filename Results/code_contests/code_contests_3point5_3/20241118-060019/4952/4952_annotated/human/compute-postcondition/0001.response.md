Example Answer:
The function `raw_input()` reads a line from the input and converts it into a list of characters. The list of characters is assigned to variable `s`. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters**
