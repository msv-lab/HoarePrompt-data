According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to n-1. 
State: **`ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1, `i` is adjusted to n-1**
