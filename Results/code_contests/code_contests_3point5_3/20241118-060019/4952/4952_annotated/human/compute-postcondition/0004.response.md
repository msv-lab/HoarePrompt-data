Example Answer:
The character at index `i` in the list `s` is appended to the string `ns`. The value of `i` is 2 less than the input value `n`, so the character at index `n-2` in the list `s` is appended to `ns`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string containing the character at index `n-2`, `i` is 2 less than the input value.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the input value, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string containing the character at index `n-2`, `i` is 2 less than the input value**
