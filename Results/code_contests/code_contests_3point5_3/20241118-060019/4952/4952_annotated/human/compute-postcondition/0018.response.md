Postcondition: ***If the input value is greater or equal to 2, `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1 in that order; `i` is either 0 or -1. If the input value is less than 2, `ns` remains an empty string; `i` is initially 2 less than the input value. After the if-else block executes, if n is odd, `ns` is an empty string and `i` is set to 0. If n is even, `ns` contains the concatenated characters at indices n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 3, 1 in that order, and `i` is either 0 or -1 based on the value of n.***
