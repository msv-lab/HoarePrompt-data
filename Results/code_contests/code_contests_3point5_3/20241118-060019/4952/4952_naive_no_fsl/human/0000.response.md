Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly decodes the word as described in the problem statement. It first constructs the decoded word by adding the letters from positions n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 2 (if n is even) or n-3, n-5, n-7, ..., 1 (if n is odd). Then it adds the remaining letters from positions 0, 2, 4, ..., n-1 (if n is odd) or 1, 3, 5, ..., n-1 (if n is even). The decoding process is implemented correctly and follows the rules specified in the problem description.
