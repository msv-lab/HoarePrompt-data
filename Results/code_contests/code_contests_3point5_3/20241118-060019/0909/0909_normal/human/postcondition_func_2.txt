The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `o`, which is a string input. The input string is split and converted into an integer. Then, `o` is added to this integer value. The function returns a list of integers where each element is the result of adding `o` to the integer value obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to an integer. However, there is a missing part in the annotation where it reads input from the console. Therefore, the actual functionality involves taking user input from the console, performing the specified operations, and returning the resulting list of integers.
