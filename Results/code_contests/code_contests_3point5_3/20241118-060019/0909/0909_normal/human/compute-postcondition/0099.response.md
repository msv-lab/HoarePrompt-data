Postcondition: ***`ans` is an integer, initially 0. If x < y * k, `ans` is updated to the sum of the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `k`, and all elements in the list `gaps`. If `gaps` is empty, `ans` remains 0, `x`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if x >= y * k, `ans` is updated to the sum of `y * g` for each element in `gaps`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `k` remains a non-zero integer. If `gaps` is empty, `ans` remains 0.***
