Postcondition: ***`sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`. `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`. `sa` is equal to `sb`. `mx` is assigned the maximum value in the set `sa` that is not in set `sb`. `gaps` is a list containing the previous value of `gl` appended with the new value of `gl`. `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0 based on the conditions. After the if part, `gl` is reset to 0. `special` is True if `ax` equals `mx` and False otherwise. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. `a` has at least 1 element. `i` is 2. `ax` is the third element in list `a`.***
