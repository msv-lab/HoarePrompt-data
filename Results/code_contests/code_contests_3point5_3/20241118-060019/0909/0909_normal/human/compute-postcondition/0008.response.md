Postcondition: ***n, m, x, k, y are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5, b is assigned a value returned by func_2(), j is between 0 and m, i is 0, ax is the value of the first element in list a. If the condition j < m and ax is equal to b[j] is true, then j is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.***
