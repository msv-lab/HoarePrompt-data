Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `x` multiplied by the integer division of `g` by `k`, and the product of `y` multiplied by the remainder of `g` divided by `k`. The values of `x`, `y`, `k` remain unchanged. The variable `gaps` still has elements left. 
Output State: **`ans` is updated, `x`, `y`, `k` remain unchanged, `gaps` still has elements left**
