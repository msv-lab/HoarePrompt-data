Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the product of `y` and `g`. The previous value of `ans` is 0, and the values of `x` and `y` are not affected by this operation. The value of `k` is not used in the calculation. The `g` is the first element in the `gaps` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated with the value of `y * g`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `k` remains a non-zero integer, `gaps` still contains elements, and `g` is the first element in the list.
Output State: **`ans` is updated with the value of `y * g`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `k` remains a non-zero integer, `gaps` still contains elements, and `g` is the first element in the list**
