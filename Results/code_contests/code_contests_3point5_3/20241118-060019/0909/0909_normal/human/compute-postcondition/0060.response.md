Output State: **`sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`. `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`. `sa` is equal to `sb`. `mx` is assigned the maximum value in the set `sa` that is not in set `sb`. `gaps` is a list containing the previous value of `gl` appended with the new value of `gl`. `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0 based on the conditions. `gl` is reset to 0 after the if part, and incremented by 1 in the else part. `special` is False after the if part, and True if `ax` equals `mx` in the else part. `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` if special is True. `a` has at least 1 element. `i` is 2. `ax` is the third element in list `a`. `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`.**
