You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: 
- n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5.
- x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
- k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
- a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_m are sequences of distinct positive integers.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *`n, m, x, k, y` are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5. `b` is assigned a value returned by func_2(). `j` is between 0 and `m`. `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. `ax` is the value of the i-th element in list a. If the condition `j < m` and `ax == b[j]` is true, then `j` is incremented by 1. The loop will not execute if `a` is an empty list or if `m` is 0, in which case `j` remains 0. After the if block executes, if `j < m`, the program returns -1. This covers all scenarios, ensuring the proper handling of edge cases and the correct behavior based on the conditions of the variables.

Case_2: *`sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the program prints 0 and returns, otherwise no action is taken.

Case_3: *`gaps` is updated to include the value of `gl` at each iteration. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. There are no changes to `gaps` in this scenario.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
