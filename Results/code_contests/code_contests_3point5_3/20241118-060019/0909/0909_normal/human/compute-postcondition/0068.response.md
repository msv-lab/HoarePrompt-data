Postcondition: ***`sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`, `sa` is equal to `sb`, `mx` is assigned the maximum value in the set `sa` that is not in set `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the previous value of `gl` appended with the new value of `gl`, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0 based on the conditions, `gl` is reset to 0 after the if part and incremented by 1 in the else part, `special` is False after the if part and True if `ax` equals `mx` in the else part, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` if special is True, `a` has at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element in list `a`. In the if part, if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, if `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, `gaps` appends the value of `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` becomes False. In the else part, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` becomes True, `gl` is increased by 1.***
