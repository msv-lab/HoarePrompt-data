Output State: **`n, m, x, k, y` are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5. `b` is assigned a value returned by func_2(). `j` is between 0 and `m`. `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. `ax` is the value of the i-th element in list a. If the condition `j < m` and `ax == b[j]` is true, then `j` is incremented by 1. The loop will not execute if `a` is an empty list or if `m` is 0, in which case `j` remains 0.**
