The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it internally uses variables `n, m, x, k, y, a, b, j, i, ax, sa, sb, gaps, gl, specialgap` to perform its operations.

Case 1: The function operates on the variables `n, m, x, k, y, a, b, j, i, ax` and performs a loop to compare elements of list `a` with list `b`. If a match is found, `j` is incremented. If the loop completes and `j < m`, the function returns -1.

Case 2: The function checks if the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal. If they are, the function prints 0 and returns.

Case 3: The function updates the `gaps` variable and checks if `specialgap` is less than `k`. If it is, the function prints -1 and returns.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to perform operations on the provided variables and return specific values based on the conditions outlined in each case.
