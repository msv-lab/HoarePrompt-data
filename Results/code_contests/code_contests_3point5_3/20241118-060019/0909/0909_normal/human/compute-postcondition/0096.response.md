Example Answer:
`ans` is updated with the value of `ans` + `y` * third element of `gaps`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `gaps` still contains elements, `g` is the third element in the list. After execution, the value of `ans` is increased by `y` times the value of `g`. 
Output State: **`ans` is updated with the new calculated value, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `gaps` still contains elements, `g` is the third element in the list**
