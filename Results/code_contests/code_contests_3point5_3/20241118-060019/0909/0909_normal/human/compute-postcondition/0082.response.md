According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `gaps`. If the list `gaps` has at least 1 element, the loop executes. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
- `ans` is 0
- `x` is an integer
- `y` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`
- `g` is the first element in the list `gaps`

State: **`ans` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`, `g` is the first element in the list `gaps`**
