According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements remaining in the `gaps` list. If there are still elements left in the list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is updated, `x`, `y`, `k` remain unchanged, and `gaps` still has elements left. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `gaps` should have at least one more element left in it.

State: **`ans` is updated, `x`, `y`, `k` remain unchanged, `gaps` still has at least one more element left**
