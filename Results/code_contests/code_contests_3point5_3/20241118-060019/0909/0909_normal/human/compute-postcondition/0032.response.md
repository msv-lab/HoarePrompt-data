According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is the index of the current element being iterated over in list `a`, and `ax` is the value of that element.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
- `a` must have at least 1 element.
- `i` should be 0, representing the index of the first element in list `a`.
- `ax` should be the first element in list `a`.
- All other variables should retain their initial values to satisfy the loop requirements.

State: **`sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`, `sa` is equal to `sb`, `mx` is assigned the maximum value in the set `sa` that is not in set `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is assigned 0, `gl` is assigned 0, `special` is False, `a` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`**
