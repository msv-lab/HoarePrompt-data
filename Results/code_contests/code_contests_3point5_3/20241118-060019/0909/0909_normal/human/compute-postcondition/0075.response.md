Example Answer:
The function `debug_print` is called with the variable `gaps`. The value of `gaps` is updated to include the value of `gl` at each iteration. The previous values of other variables are unknown, so the output state is: `gaps` is updated to include the value of `gl` at each iteration.
Output State: **`gaps` is updated to include the value of `gl` at each iteration**
