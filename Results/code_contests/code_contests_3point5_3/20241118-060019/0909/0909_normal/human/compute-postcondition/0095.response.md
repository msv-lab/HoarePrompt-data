According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in the `gaps` list. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated with the value of `ans` + `y` * second element of `gaps`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `gaps` still contains elements, `g` is the second element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `g` should move to the next element in the list.
State: **`ans` is updated with the value of `ans` + `y` * third element of `gaps`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `gaps` still contains elements, `g` is the third element in the list**
