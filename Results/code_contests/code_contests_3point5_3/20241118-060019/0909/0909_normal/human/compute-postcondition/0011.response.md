Postcondition: ***`n, m, x, k, y` are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5. `b` is assigned a value returned by func_2(). `j` is between 0 and `m+1`. `i` is 1. `ax` is the value of the second element in list a. If j is less than m and ax is equal to b[j], then j is incremented by 1. The postcondition covers all possible combinations and edge cases of the variables after the execution of the if statement.***
