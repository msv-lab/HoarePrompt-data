According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in list `a`. If there are more elements in list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n, m, x, k, y` are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5, `b` is assigned a value returned by func_2(), `j` is between 0 and `m`, `i` is 0, `ax` is the value of the first element in list a. If the condition `j < m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]` is true, then `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `a` must have more elements and the next element's index should be considered.
State: **`n, m, x, k, y` are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5, `b` is assigned a value returned by func_2(), `j` is between 0 and `m+1`, `i` is 1, `ax` is the value of the second element in list a**
