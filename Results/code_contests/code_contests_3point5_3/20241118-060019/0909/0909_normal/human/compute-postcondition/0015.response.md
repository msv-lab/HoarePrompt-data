According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the elements in list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `ax` is the value of the third element in list `a`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. `i` should be less than the length of list `a` to continue looping.
2. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n, m, x, k, y` are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5. `b` is assigned a value returned by func_2(). `j` is between 0 and `m+1`. `i` is 3. If j < m and ax == b[j], then j is incremented by 1.**
