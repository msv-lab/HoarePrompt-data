According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `a`, `i`, and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n, m, x, k, y` are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5, `b` is assigned a value returned by func_2(), `j` is between 0 and `m+1`, `i` is 1, `ax` is the value of the second element in list a. If j is less than m and ax is equal to b[j], then j is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` should be incremented by 1.
- If `ax` equals `b[j]`, then j should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n, m, x, k, y` are positive integers between 1 and 2*10^5, `b` is assigned a value returned by func_2(), `j` is between 0 and `m+1`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the value of the third element in list a**
