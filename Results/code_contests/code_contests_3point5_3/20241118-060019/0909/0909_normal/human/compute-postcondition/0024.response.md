Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(0)` simply outputs the integer 0. It does not affect the initial state of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`. The sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, meaning they contain the same elements.
Output State: **`sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`. The sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, meaning they contain the same elements**
