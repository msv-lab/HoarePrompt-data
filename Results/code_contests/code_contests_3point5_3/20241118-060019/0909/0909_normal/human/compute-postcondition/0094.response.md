Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated by adding the product of `y` and `g`. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but `y` and `g` have specific values. Since `g` is the second element in the list, `g` is known to be the second element in the list `gaps`. Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding `y` multiplied by the second element of the list `gaps`. The states of `x`, `y`, `k`, and `gaps` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`ans` is updated with the value of `ans` + `y` * second element of `gaps`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `gaps` still contains elements, `g` is the second element in the list**
