According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `j` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 element and `i` is 0 and `ax` is the value of the first element in the list `a`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `x`, `k`, and `y` are assigned values returned by func_2(), `b` is assigned the value returned by func_2(), `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the value of the first element in list `a`**
