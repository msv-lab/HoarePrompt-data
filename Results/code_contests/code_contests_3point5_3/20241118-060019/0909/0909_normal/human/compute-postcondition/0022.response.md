Example Answer:
`sb` is assigned the set containing elements of list `b`. The previous values of `sa` and `a` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`.
Output State: **`sa` is a set containing elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of list `b`**
