The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters but internally uses variables `n, m, x, k, y, a, b, j, i, ax, sa, sb, gaps, gl, specialgap` to perform its operations. It iterates through elements of list `a` and `b`, incrementing `j` if a match is found. If `j < m` at the end of the loop, it returns -1. It then checks if sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, printing 0 and returning if they are. The function updates `gaps` and verifies if `specialgap` is less than `k`, printing -1 and returning in that case. The functionality includes handling empty lists and ensuring proper behavior based on the specified conditions.
