Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for n, m, x, k, y, a, and b.
2. It then iterates through the sequence a and checks if the elements match the sequence b. If not, it prints -1 and returns, which is in line with the problem description.
3. It then checks if the set of elements in a is equal to the set of elements in b. If they are equal, it prints 0 and returns, which is also correct.
4. The program then calculates the minimum amount of mana needed to transform sequence a into sequence b based on the provided conditions for fireball and berserk spells. The logic for this calculation seems correct and follows the problem description.
5. Finally, it prints the calculated minimum amount of mana required, which is the expected output.
6. The code also handles cases where it may not be possible to transform sequence a into sequence b, as it checks for special cases where the maximum power value is involved and where the gap is less than k.

Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles various edge cases.
