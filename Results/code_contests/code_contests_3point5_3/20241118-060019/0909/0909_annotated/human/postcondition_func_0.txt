The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It goes through multiple cases based on different conditions:
- Case_1: If `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, and `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns. This case also handles scenarios where the list `a` is empty or if the elements in list `a` do not match the corresponding elements in list `b`, in which case `j` remains 0, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element in list `a`.
- Case_2: If `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `sa` is a set created from the elements of list `a`, and `sb` is a set created from the elements of list `b`. If the set `sa` is equal to set `sb`, then the program prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `j`, `i`, `ax`, `sa`, and `sb`.
- Case_3: If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, and `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`. If `special` is False, all variables remain unchanged. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. No changes are made to any variables. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to handle different cases based on the conditions specified and return different values or perform different actions accordingly.
