According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `gaps`. If there are more elements in `gaps`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions were met: 
- If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`
- `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`
- `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `ans` is increased by the value of `x` multiplied by the floor division of `g` by `k` plus the value of `y` multiplied by the modulus of `g` by `k`
- `x` is less than the product of `y` and `k`
- `gaps` contains more elements
- `ans` is updated with the calculation x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `gaps` must contain more elements. No other states need adjustment.
