Postcondition: ***If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, and `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`. If `special` is False, all variables remain unchanged. In the program fragment, if `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. No changes are made to any variables.***
