According to the given conditions, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1
- `special` needs to be set to False
- `specialgap` needs to be set to `gl`
- 0 needs to be appended to `gaps`
- `gl` needs to be set to 0
- `gaps` needs to be adjusted to include 0 to ensure the loop can execute again

If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then:
- `j` needs to be set to 0
- `ax` needs to be set to 0
- `special` needs to be set to True
- `specialgap` needs to be set to 0
- `gl` needs to be set to 1
- `gaps` needs to be adjusted to be 0 to handle the edge cases and ensure the loop can continue

State: **`j`, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, `gaps` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration**
