Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `sa` is a set created from the elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set created from the elements of list `b`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is True, `a` has at least one element. The condition (j < m and ax == b[j]) is false. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True. Otherwise, the program retains the initial state with no changes. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if statement.***
