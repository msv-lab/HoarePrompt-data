Postcondition: ***`j`, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, `gaps` are adjusted based on the following conditions: if `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True. In this case, `j` is 0, `ax` is 0, `special` is True, `specialgap` is 0, `gl` is 0, and `gaps` is 0 to ensure the loop can execute again.***
