Example Answer:
The value `gl` is appended to the list `gaps`. The previous values of `gl` and `gaps` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is incremented by 1, `ax` is adjusted accordingly, `special` is adjusted accordingly, `specialgap` is set to `gl`, `gl` is appended to `gaps`, `gaps` is adjusted accordingly to ensure the loop can execute again.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `ax` is adjusted accordingly, `special` is adjusted accordingly, `specialgap` is set to `gl`, `gl` is appended to `gaps`, `gaps` is adjusted accordingly to ensure the loop can execute again**
