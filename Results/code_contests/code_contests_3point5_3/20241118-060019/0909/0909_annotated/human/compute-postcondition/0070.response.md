Output State: **`j`, `i`, `ax`, `sa`, `sb`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` are all integers or sets/lists based on the conditions of the loop. After the loop executes, `gaps` will contain the lengths of consecutive matching elements between lists `a` and `b`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, `j` is incremented, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, `gl` is appended to `gaps`, and reset to 0, `special` is set to False. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, and `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to 0, `gl` is incremented by 1. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute and all variables remain in their initial state.**
