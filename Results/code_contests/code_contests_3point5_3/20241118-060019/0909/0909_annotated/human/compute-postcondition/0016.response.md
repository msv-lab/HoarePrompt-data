Output State: **`j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is the index of the current element in list `a`, `ax` is the current element in list `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. The loop will not execute if the list `a` is empty or if the elements in list `a` do not match the corresponding elements in list `b`. In those cases, `j` remains 0, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element in list `a`.**
