Postcondition: ***`j`, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl` are integers. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is set to `gl`, `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`, `gl` is 0, and `special` is set to False. Otherwise, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is True. In the else part, if the condition is not met, `j` is 0, `ax` is 0, `special` is True, `specialgap` is 0, `gl` is 1, and `gaps` is 0.***
