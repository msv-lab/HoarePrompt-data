Postcondition: ***`j`, `i` are integers, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `sa` is a set created from the elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set created from the elements of list `b`, `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`, `gl` is either 0 or 1, `special` is either False or True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, `a` has at least one element. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, `j` is increased by 1, and if `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, otherwise `specialgap` remains unchanged. The value of `gl` is appended to the `gaps` list and reset to 0, `special` is set to False. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, and `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True, otherwise `special` remains unchanged. In all cases, `gl` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 0.***
