According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `gaps`, `special`, `specialgap`, `k`, `ans`, `x`, and `y`. If `special` is True and `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program will print -1 and return, so `special` must be True and `specialgap` must be greater than or equal to `k`. `ans` is assigned 0, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` and `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`, `special` is True, `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`.**
