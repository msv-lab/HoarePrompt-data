Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `sa` is a set created from the elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set created from the elements of list `b`. If the set `sa` is equal to set `sb`, then the program prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `j`, `i`, `ax`, `sa`, and `sb`.***
