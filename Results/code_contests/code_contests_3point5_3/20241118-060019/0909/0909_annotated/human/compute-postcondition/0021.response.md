Output State: **`j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns. The loop will not execute if the list `a` is empty or if the elements in list `a` do not match the corresponding elements in list `b`, in which case `j` remains 0, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element in list `a`. `sa` is a set created from the elements of list `a`.**
