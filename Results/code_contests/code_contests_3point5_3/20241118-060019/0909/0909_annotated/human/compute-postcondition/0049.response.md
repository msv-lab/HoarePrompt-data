Example Answer:
`specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, and both `specialgap` and `gl` are not affected by previous code. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap` is `gl`, `gaps` are not affected.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap` is `gl`, `gaps` are not affected**
