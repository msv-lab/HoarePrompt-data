Output State: **If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`, `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the value of `x` multiplied by the floor division of `g` by `k` plus the value of `y` multiplied by the modulus of `g` by `k`, `x` is less than the product of `y` and `k`, `gaps` contains more elements, `ans` is updated with the calculation x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)**
