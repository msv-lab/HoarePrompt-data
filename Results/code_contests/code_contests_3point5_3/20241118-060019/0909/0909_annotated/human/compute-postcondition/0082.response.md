According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `gaps`, `special`, `specialgap`, `k`, `ans`, `x`, `y`, and `gl`. 

1. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` and `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`.
2. If `special` is False, all variables remain unchanged.
3. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns.
4. `ans` is 0.
5. `x` is less than the product of `y` and `k`.

For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: 
**If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`, `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 0, `x` is less than the product of `y` and `k`**.
