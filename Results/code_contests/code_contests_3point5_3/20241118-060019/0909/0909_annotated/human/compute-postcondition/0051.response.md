Example Answer:
`gl` is appended to the list `gaps`. The values of `ax`, `special`, `specialgap` remain the same if `special` is true. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. 
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap` is equal to `gl`, `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`.**
