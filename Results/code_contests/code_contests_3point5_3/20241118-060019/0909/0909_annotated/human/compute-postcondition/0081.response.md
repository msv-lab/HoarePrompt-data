Postcondition: ***If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` and `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`. If `special` is False, all variables remain unchanged. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. `ans` is 0. Additionally, `x` is less than the product of `y` and `k`.***
