Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer less than `m`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 2. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `ax` is determined by whether `j` was incremented or not; if `j` was incremented, `ax` becomes the third element in list `a`, otherwise `ax` remains the second element in list `a`. All edge cases are handled, ensuring the correct progression and relationship between the variables `j`, `a`, `i`, and `ax` after the if statement execution.***
