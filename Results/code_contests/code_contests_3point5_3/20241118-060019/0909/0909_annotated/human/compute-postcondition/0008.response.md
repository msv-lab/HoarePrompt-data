Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and the element at index `j` in list `a` is equal to the element at index `j` in list `b`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
