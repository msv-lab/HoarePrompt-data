According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `ax`, `b`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, `gaps`, `mx`, `a`. 
1. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. 
2. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is set to `gl`, `gaps` contains the appended value of `gl`, `gl` is 0, and `special` is set to False. 
3. Otherwise, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is True. 
4. In the else part, if the condition is not met, `j` is 0, `ax` is 0, `special` is True, `specialgap` is 0, `gl` is 1, and `gaps` is 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
`j`, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl` have specific values that are not given, and the other variables are not mentioned.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Check if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]` to determine if the loop can execute again based on these conditions. Adjust `j` accordingly.
2. Check if `special` is True to determine if the loop needs to handle the special conditions, adjust `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, and `gaps` accordingly.
3. If the conditions are not met, reset the states as follows: `j` is 0, `ax` is 0, `special` is True, `specialgap` is 0, `gl` is 1, and `gaps` is 0.

State: **Adjust the values of `j`, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, `gaps` based on the conditions mentioned above to ensure the loop can execute again.**
