Postcondition: ***`j`, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, `gaps` are adjusted based on the conditions. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `special` is set to False, `specialgap` is set to `gl`, 0 is appended to `gaps`, `gl` is set to 0, and `gaps` is adjusted to include 0 to ensure the loop can execute again. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is set to 0, `ax` is set to 0, `special` is set to True, `specialgap` is set to 0, `gl` is set to 1, and `gaps` is adjusted to be 0 to handle the edge cases and ensure the loop can continue.***
