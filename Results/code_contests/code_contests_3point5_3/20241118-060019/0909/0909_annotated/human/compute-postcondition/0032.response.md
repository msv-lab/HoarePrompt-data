According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in list `a` to enumerate. So, `a` must have at least one element. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `sa` is a set created from the elements of list `a`, `sb` is a set created from the elements of list `b`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` has at least one element**
