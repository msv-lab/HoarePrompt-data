According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `i`, `ax`, `sa`, `sb`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap`, `a` have specific values based on the previous iteration. To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
2. If `special` is True, `specialgap` needs to be assigned the value of `gl`, otherwise `specialgap` remains unchanged.
3. The value of `gl` needs to be appended to the `gaps` list and reset to 0.
4. `special` needs to be set to False.
5. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, and `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` needs to be set to True, otherwise `special` remains unchanged.
6. `gl` needs to be either incremented by 1 or reset to 0.

State: **Adjust the values of `j`, `ax`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, `gaps` according to the conditions mentioned above.**
