According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there is a valid index `i` and corresponding element `ax` in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, and `i` is 2. To execute one more time, the next element in the list `a` should be accessed along with the corresponding index. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`j` is an integer less than `m`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3**
