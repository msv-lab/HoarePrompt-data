Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('Impossible')` simply prints out the string 'Impossible'. Since no variables are involved or affected, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each namei is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length between 1 and 100. All names are different.**
