Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints indicate that the function should print 'Impossible' and exit the program with a status code of 0 if there is no valid order of letters in the Latin alphabet that satisfies the lexicographical ordering of the given names. However, the code does not have this implementation. Instead, the code tries to find a valid order and prints it if found, without considering the case where it might be impossible to find a valid order. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the scenario where it is impossible to find a valid order.
