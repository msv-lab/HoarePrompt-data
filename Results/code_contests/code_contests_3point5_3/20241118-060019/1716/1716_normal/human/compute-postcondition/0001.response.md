Example Answer: 
The `exit(0)` function terminates the program with a status code of 0. There are no variables affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is unchanged.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; Each namei is a string containing only lowercase Latin letters with a length between 1 and 100; All names are different.**
