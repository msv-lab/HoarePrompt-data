Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if there exists an order of letters in the Latin alphabet such that the given names are sorted lexicographically. It iterates through each pair of names and constructs a graph to represent the order of letters. It then finds the correct order by removing letters with no dependencies. Finally, it outputs the order of letters if it exists, otherwise, it prints "Impossible". The logic of the program is sound and it correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement.
