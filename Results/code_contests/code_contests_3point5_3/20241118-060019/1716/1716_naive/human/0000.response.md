Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly determines if there exists an order of letters in the Latin alphabet such that the given names are sorted lexicographically. The program iterates through the names, compares them character by character, and builds a set of relationships between characters based on their order. If at any point there is a contradiction in the relationships, it correctly outputs "Impossible". Otherwise, it constructs a valid order of letters based on the relationships and outputs it.

The program handles all potential cases where the names provided do not follow the lexicographical order after a modification of the order of letters in the alphabet. It correctly identifies when it is impossible to find such an order and provides the correct order if it exists.
