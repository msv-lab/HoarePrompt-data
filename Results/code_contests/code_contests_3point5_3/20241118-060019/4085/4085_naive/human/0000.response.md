Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads the input and then iterates through the blocks of each message, checking if the total lengths match. If they do, it increments the count of files in the archive. The program keeps track of the current length of the files being checked in each message and updates them accordingly. This logic correctly follows the problem description and will determine the maximum number of files that could be in the archive if Zhorik's assumption is correct. The program handles different block sizes and orders of blocks correctly.
