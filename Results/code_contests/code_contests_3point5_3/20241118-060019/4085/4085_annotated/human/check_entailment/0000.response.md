Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input values of blocks from the two messages and compares them to determine the maximum number of files that could be in the archive.
2. It iterates through the blocks in both messages and keeps track of the cumulative sum of block lengths for each message.
3. If the sum of block lengths in both messages is the same, it increments the count of files by 1 and resets the block lengths for the next set of files.
4. The program correctly handles cases where the order of files is maintained while transferring archives through the network.
5. The logic of the program seems to align with the problem description, and it covers all possible cases based on the input constraints provided.
