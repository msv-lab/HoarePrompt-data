The function reads input for three lists, calculates the sum of lengths of blocks in two of the lists, and compares them. It then increments a counter `f` based on certain conditions within a while loop, and finally prints the value of `f`. If the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message, it increments `f` by 1. The function compares two messages composed of blocks to ensure that the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message.
