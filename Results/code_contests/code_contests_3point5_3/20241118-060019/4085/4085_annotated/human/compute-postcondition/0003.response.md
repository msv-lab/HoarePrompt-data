Example Answer:
`s1` is assigned the integer value at index 0 of `q2`. The value at index 0 of `q2` is converted to an integer and stored in `s1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers representing the number of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The lengths of blocks in each message are positive integers. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. q1 is assigned the split input values. q2 contains the split input values from raw_input(). q3 is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values from raw_input(). s1 is an integer value obtained from the split input values in q2.
