Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages are positive integers, the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message, `q1` is assigned the split input values, `q2` contains the split input values from `raw_input()`, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values from `raw_input()`, `s1` is an integer value obtained from the split input values in `q2`, `s2` is an integer value obtained from the first element of `q3`, `f` is 1, `p1` is 2, `p2` is 1, `a1` is an integer value obtained from the first element of `q1`, `a2` is an integer value obtained from the second element of `q1`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` is set to 0, `s2` is set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is increased by 1, and `s1` is updated to its previous value plus the integer value obtained from `q2` at index `p1`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1 and `s2` is updated to its previous value plus the integer value obtained from `q3` at index `p2.***
