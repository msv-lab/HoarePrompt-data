Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers. The lengths of blocks in the first and second messages are positive integers such that the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1` is assigned the split input values, `q2` contains the split input values from `raw_input()`, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values from `raw_input()`, `s1` is increased by the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0. `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1. `a1` is an integer value obtained from the first element of `q1`, and `a2` is an integer value obtained from the second element of `q1`. `p2` is increased by 1.**
