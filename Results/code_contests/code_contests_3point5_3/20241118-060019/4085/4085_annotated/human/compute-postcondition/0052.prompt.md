You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see examples of the loop executing several times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after the execution of the loop. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` had greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 or lower than one then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`, i equals n
Output State: **`if n is at least 1 then factorial` is the factorial of `n`, n is 0. if i is lower than 1 the loop doesnt execute and factorial is 1**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in thethe end students will be 0. if studenmts is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **`if students is greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to students, students is 0 at the end. if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**

Your Task:

Initial State: n and m are positive integers, the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages are positive integers, the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message, q1 is assigned the split input values, q2 contains the split input values from raw_input(), q3 is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values from raw_input(), s1 is an integer value obtained from the split input values in q2, s2 is an integer value obtained from the first element of q3, f is 0, p1 is assigned the value 0, p2 is 0, a1 is an integer value obtained from the first element of q1, a2 is an integer value obtained from the second element of q1
Code of the loop:
```
while p1 < a1 and p2 < a2:
    if s1 == s2:
        s1 = 0
        s2 = 0
        f = f + 1
        p1 = p1 + 1
        p2 = p2 + 1
    if s1 < s2:
        p1 = p1 + 1
        s1 = s1 + int(q2[p1])
    if s1 > s2:
        p2 = p2 + 1
        s2 = s2 + int(q3[p2])

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` and `m` are positive integers, the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages are positive integers, the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message, `q1` is assigned the split input values, `q2` contains the split input values from `raw_input()`, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values from `raw_input()`, `s1` is an integer value obtained from the split input values in `q2`, `s2` is an integer value obtained from the first element of `q3`, `f` is 1, `p1` is 2, `p2` is 1, `a1` is an integer value obtained from the first element of `q1`, `a2` is an integer value obtained from the second element of `q1`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` is set to 0, `s2` is set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is increased by 1, and `s1` is updated to its previous value plus the integer value obtained from `q2` at index `p1`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1 and `s2` is updated to its previous value plus the integer value obtained from `q3` at index `p2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` and `m` are positive integers. The lengths of blocks in the first and second messages are positive integers such that the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1` is assigned the split input values, `q2` contains the split input values from `raw_input()`, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values from `raw_input()`, `s1` is increased by the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0. `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1. `a1` is an integer value obtained from the first element of `q1`, and `a2` is an integer value obtained from the second element of `q1`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1 and `s2` is increased by the integer value at index `p2` of `q3`. This condition ensures that the program correctly handles the case where the sum of blocks in the first message is greater than the sum of blocks in the second message.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` and `m` are positive integers. The lengths of blocks in the first and second messages are positive integers such that the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1` is assigned the split input values, `q2` contains the split input values from `raw_input()`, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values from `raw_input()`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0. `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1. `a1` is an integer value obtained from the first element of `q1`, and `a2` is an integer value obtained from the second element of `q1`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1 and `s2` is increased by the integer value at index `p2` of `q3`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is increased by 1 and `s1` is increased by the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, then no changes are made to the variables `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2`. After the execution of the if statement, if `s1 > s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1 and `s2` is increased by the integer value at index `p2` of `q3`. Otherwise, no changes are made to any of the variables.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
