The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for comparing two messages composed of blocks. The blocks in each message are represented by positive integers. The function verifies if the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. The function does not return any value; instead, it performs the comparison and ensures that the sum of lengths of blocks in both messages is equal. 
Functionality: **The function compares two messages composed of blocks to ensure that the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message.**
