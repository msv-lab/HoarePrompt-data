Output State: **If both p1 and p2 are less than a1 and a2 respectively, and the sum of s1 and s2 is equal, then f is increased by 1, p1 and p2 are incremented by 1, s1 and s2 are set to 0. If s1 is less than s2, p1 is incremented by 1 and s1 is updated with the value at index p1 of q2. If s1 is greater than s2, p2 is incremented by 1 and s2 is updated with the value at index p2 of q3. If any of the conditions are not met, the loop will exit.**
