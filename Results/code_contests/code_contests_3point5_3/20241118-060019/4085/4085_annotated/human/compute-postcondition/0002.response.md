Example Answer:
The function raw_input() accepts an input and splits it into a list of strings. q3 is assigned this list of strings. The previous values of n, m, q1, and q2 are unknown, so the output state is: n and m are positive integers representing the number of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The lengths of blocks in each message are positive integers. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. q1 is assigned the split input values. q2 contains the split input values from raw_input(). q3 is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values from raw_input().
