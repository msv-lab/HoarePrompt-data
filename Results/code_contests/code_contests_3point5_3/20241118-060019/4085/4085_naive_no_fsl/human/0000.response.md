Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and then iterates through the blocks of the two messages to determine the maximum number of files that could be in the archive. It updates the block sizes and pointers according to the problem description. The logic seems to be correct and follows the problem requirements. 

Additionally, the program terminates when all blocks have been processed and prints the correct output. The code seems to handle the given problem description accurately for all potential cases.
