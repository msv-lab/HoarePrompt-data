Example Answer: 
`s1` is assigned the value `int(q2[0])`, where `q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. The value at index 0 of `q2` is converted to an integer and assigned to `s1`. 
Output State: **`q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is also a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `s1` is an integer**
