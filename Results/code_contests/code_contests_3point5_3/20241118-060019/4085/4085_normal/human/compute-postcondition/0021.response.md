Postcondition: ***`q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `s1` is an integer. `s2` is an integer extracted from the input. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `s1` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`. `s2` remains the same. `f` is an integer incremented by 1, `p1` is an integer incremented by 1, `p2` is an integer incremented by 1. `a1` is an integer value dependent on the content of `q1`, `a2` is an integer extracted from the second element of `q1`.***
