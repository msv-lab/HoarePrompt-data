Output State: **`q2`, `q3` are lists of strings. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0. `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, `p1` is increased by 1 and `s1` is updated to be the concatenation of its current value and the integer value of `q2[p1]`. `p2` is incremented by 1. `s2` is updated to be the concatenation of its current value and the integer value of `q3[p2]`.**
