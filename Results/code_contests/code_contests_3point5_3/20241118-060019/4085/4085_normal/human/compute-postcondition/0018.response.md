Output State: **`q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `s1` is an integer, `s2` is an integer extracted from the input, `f` is an integer incremented by 1, `p1` is an integer incremented by 2, `p2` is an integer incremented by 1. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0. `a1` is an integer value dependent on the content of `q1`, `a2` is an integer extracted from the second element of `q1`. `s1` is less than `s2`**
