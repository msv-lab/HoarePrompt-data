Example Answer: 
`q2` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`. The `split()` function splits the input string based on whitespace. The previous values of `q2` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
