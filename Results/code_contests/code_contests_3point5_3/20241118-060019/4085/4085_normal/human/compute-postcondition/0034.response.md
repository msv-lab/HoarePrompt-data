Postcondition: ***`q2`, `q3` are lists of strings, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2` are integers. If `s1` < `s2`, `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`. If `s1` = `s2`, `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` and `p2` are both incremented by 1. `a1` is updated based on the content of `q1`, and `a2` is extracted from the second element of `q1`. If `s1` > `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p2` of `q3`. In all cases, `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`.***
