Postcondition: ***`q2` and `q3` are lists of strings obtained by splitting the input, `s1` is an integer. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `s1` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`. `s2` is an integer extracted from the input. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0. `f` is an integer incremented by 1, `p1` is an integer incremented by 1, and `p2` is an integer incremented by 1. `a1` is an integer value dependent on the content of `q1`, `a2` is an integer extracted from the second element of `q1`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, `p2` is increased by 1, and `s2` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p2` of `q3`. All other variables retain their previous values, `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. In the case where `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1.***
