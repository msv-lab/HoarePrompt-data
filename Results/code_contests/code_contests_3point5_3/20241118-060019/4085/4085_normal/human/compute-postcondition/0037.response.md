Postcondition: ***`q2`, `q3` are lists of strings, `s1`, `s2` have been updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment. If `s1` > `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p2` of `q3`. `f`, `p1`, `p2` have been updated accordingly with `p2` being incremented by 1. In all cases, `p1` < `a1` and `p2` < `a2`.***
