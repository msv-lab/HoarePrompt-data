Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user, processes it based on certain conditions within a loop, and prints the value of `f` after the loop execution. The loop iterates while `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`, updating `s1` and `s2` accordingly. If `s1` is less than `s2`, `s1` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, and `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are each incremented by 1. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1, and `s2` is updated by adding the integer value at index `p2` of `q3`. The function operates under the assumption that `a1` and `a2` are positive integers. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
