Postcondition: ***`q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `s1` is an integer, `s2` is an integer extracted from the input, `f` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is an integer value dependent on the content of `q1`, `a2` is an integer extracted from the second element of `q1`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1`, `s2` are both set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are all incremented by 1.***
