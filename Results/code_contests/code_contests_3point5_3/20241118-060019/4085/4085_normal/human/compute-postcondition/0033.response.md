Example Answer:
The value of `p1` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `s1`, `q2`, and `p1` are unknown. The value at index `p1` of string `q2` is converted to an integer and added to `s1`. Therefore, the output state is: All variables retain their previous values except `p1` which is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **All variables retain their previous values except `p1` which is incremented by 1**
