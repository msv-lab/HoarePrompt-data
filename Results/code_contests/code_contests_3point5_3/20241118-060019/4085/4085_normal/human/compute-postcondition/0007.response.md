Example Answer: 
`p2` is assigned the value 0, but the previous values of the other variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `s1` is an integer, `s2` is an integer extracted from the input, `f` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0.
Output State: **`q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `s1` is an integer, `s2` is an integer extracted from the input, `f` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0**
