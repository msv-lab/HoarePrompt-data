Example Answer: 
`q3` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `split()` splits the input into a list of strings. `q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, so after execution, `q3` will contain the same strings as `q2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is also a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is also a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
