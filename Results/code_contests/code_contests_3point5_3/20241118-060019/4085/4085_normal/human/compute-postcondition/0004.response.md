Example Answer:
`s2` is assigned the integer value at the 0th index of list `q3`. The value of `q3` is obtained by splitting the input, so `s2` will be an integer extracted from the input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `s1` is an integer, `s2` is an integer extracted from the input.
Output State: **`q2` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `q3` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `s1` is an integer, `s2` is an integer extracted from the input**
