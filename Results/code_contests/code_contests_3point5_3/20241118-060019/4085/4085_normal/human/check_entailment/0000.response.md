Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not handle the case where the number of blocks in the two messages are not equal. The code assumes that the number of blocks in the two messages are the same, which is not a valid assumption as per the problem description. The code should be able to handle cases where the number of blocks in the two messages are different. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
