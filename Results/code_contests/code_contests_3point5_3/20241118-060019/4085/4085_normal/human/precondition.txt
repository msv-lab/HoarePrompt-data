**Precondition**: n and m are positive integers representing the number of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. Each xi and yi (1 <= xi, yi <= 106) represents the length of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message.
