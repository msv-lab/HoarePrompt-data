Correctness: **True**

The program takes in the total number of nodes `n` and the number of exit-nodes `k`, calculates the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes, and then constructs the network accordingly. The program ensures that each exit-node is connected to exactly one other node, while all other nodes are connected to at least two nodes.

The program follows the problem description by printing the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes and then printing the connections between nodes as required. The logic for constructing the network based on the given constraints is correctly implemented.

Overall, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
