According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `startIndex`. If `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` and `i + 1` are printed. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1` and `startIndex` should be adjusted to `startIndex + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `startIndex` is `startIndex + 1`**
