According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the code printed the values of `startIndex + branchLength - 2` and `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, which means the loop executed up to `startIndex + branchLength - 2` but not beyond. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The code will print the values of `startIndex + branchLength - 1` and `startIndex + branchLength`**
