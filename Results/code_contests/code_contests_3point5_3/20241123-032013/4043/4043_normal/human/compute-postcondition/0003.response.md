Since the loop iterates over a range defined by `startIndex` and `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, the loop will execute as long as the current value of `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration should be `startIndex + branchLength - 2`.

State: **`i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 2`**
