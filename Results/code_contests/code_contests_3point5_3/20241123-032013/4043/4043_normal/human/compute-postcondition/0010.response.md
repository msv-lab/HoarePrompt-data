The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `startIndex` and `branchLength`, both of which are integers. The constraints are that 3 ≤ `startIndex` ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ `branchLength` ≤ `startIndex` - 1. The function returns the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters, `startIndex` and `branchLength`, and return the sum of the two parameters.
