Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes by following the problem description.
- The function `func_1` works as expected, connecting nodes with wires in the network while ensuring that exit-nodes are connected properly.
- The code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. The output agrees with the code logic and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not behave as expected.
