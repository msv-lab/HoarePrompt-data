Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It constructs a network of nodes with minimum possible wires such that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is minimized. The program follows the constraints mentioned in the problem description and prints the output as required. Additionally, the annotations in the code provide a clear explanation of the program's logic. Since the program works as expected for all potential cases based on the problem description and there are no discrepancies found, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
