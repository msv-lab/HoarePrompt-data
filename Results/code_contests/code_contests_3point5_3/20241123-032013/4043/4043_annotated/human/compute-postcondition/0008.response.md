Output State: **If `startIndex + branchLength - 1` is less than `n`, the loop will execute and print the values of `i` and `i + 1` as specified. If `startIndex + branchLength - 1` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop will not execute. In both cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, `startIndex` is valid, and `branchLength` is valid.**
