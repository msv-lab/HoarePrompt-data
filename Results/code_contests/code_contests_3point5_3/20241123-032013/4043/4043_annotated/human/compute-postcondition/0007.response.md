According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, meaning `i` should be equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 3`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, `startIndex` is valid, `branchLength` is valid, `i` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength - 3`, and the values of `i` and `i + 1` are printed**
