Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the values 1 and `startIndex` formatted as a string. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: n and k are integers such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 2 <= k <= n - 1.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 2 <= k <= n - 1**
