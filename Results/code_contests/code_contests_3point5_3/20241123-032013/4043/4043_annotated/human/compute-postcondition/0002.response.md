Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the formatted string with placeholders replaced by the values of `i` and `i + 1`. Since the values of `i` and `i + 1` are not given in the initial state, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, `startIndex` is valid, `branchLength` is valid, `startIndex + branchLength - 1` falls within the valid index range**
