According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the values of `startIndex`, `branchLength`, and the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1` are valid. Given that `n` and `k` are integers such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 2 <= k <= n - 1, the loop will execute if `startIndex` is such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1` falls within the range of valid indices.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, `startIndex` is valid, `branchLength` is valid, `startIndex + branchLength - 1` falls within the valid index range**
