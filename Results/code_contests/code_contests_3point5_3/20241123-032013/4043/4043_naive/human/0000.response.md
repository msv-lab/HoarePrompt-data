Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program does not guarantee that the exit-nodes are connected to exactly one other node of the network. It also does not ensure that all other nodes are connected to at least two nodes. Additionally, the program does not handle all potential cases to minimize the maximum distance between two exit-nodes. An example where the program fails is when n=4 and k=2.
