According to the code, the loop executes based on the range of values obtained from popping elements from the `le` list. Since an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list at the end of the previous iteration, the `le` list must not be empty for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `le` needs to be adjusted to contain at least one element. No other states need adjustment.
State: **An IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list. `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the median of `l` if `l` is not empty, otherwise it contains a single element 0. `le` contains at least one element. `n` is a valid integer value. The sum of absolute differences is appended to `af` accordingly in all scenarios.**
