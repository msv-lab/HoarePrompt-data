According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `int(le.pop())` after popping an element from the list `le`. If the result is a valid integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `af` is an empty list, so in order for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `le` has at least one element to pop, and the result of `int(le.pop())` is a valid integer. 
State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` has at least one element to pop, result of `int(le.pop())` is a valid integer**
