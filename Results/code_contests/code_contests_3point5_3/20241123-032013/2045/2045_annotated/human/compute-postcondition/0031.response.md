According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `le` list to pop. At the end of the last iteration, an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list, indicating that `le` is currently empty. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `le` needs to have at least one element for popping.
State: **An IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list. `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the median of `l` if `l` is not empty; otherwise, it contains a single element 0. `le` contains at least one valid element. `n` is a valid integer value.**
