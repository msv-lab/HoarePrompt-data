Example Answer:
The list comprehension subtracts each element pair `(a, b)` in the enumerated list `l`. However, since `l` is empty, an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list. The initial state variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` is empty, `n` is a valid integer value, and an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list**
