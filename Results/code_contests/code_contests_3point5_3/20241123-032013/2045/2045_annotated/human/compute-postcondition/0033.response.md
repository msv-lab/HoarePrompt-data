Example Answer:
The code prints each element of the list `af` separated by a new line. If `le` is not empty, the loop executes, and `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the median of `l`. If `le` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `af` remains an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: After the loop executes, `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the median of `l`, or 0 if `l` is empty. An IndexError is raised if `le` is empty when popping. `n` is a valid integer value.
