Example Answer:
The code attempts to pop an element from the empty list `le`, which will result in an IndexError since there are no elements to pop. The variables `af` and `n` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is an empty list, `le` is empty, `n` is a valid integer value, and an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list.
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` is empty, `n` is a valid integer value, and an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list**
