Output State: **After the loop executes, `af` is a list. If `l` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the median of `l`. If `l` is empty, `af` contains a single element 0. An IndexError is raised if `le` is empty when popping. `n` is a valid integer value. If `le` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `af` remains an empty list.**
