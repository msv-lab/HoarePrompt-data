Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the standard input, processes the input data, and calculates the sum of absolute differences for each set of elements based on specific conditions. It prints the results to the standard output. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it relies on the input read from the standard input. An IndexError may occur if the input format is incorrect or insufficient.**
