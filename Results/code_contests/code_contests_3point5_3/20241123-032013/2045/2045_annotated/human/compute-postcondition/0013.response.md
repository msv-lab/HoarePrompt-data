According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `int(le.pop())`. If `le` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list, so `le` needs to be adjusted to contain at least one valid element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`af` is a list. If `l` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the median of `l`. An IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list. `le` contains a valid element. `n` is a valid integer value. If `l` is empty, `af` contains a single element 0. An IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list. `le` remains empty. `n` is a valid integer value.**
