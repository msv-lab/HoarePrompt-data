Postcondition: ***An IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list. `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and the median of `l` if `l` is not empty; otherwise, it contains a single element 0. `le` is still empty. `n` is a valid integer value. The sum of absolute differences is appended to `af` accordingly in all scenarios, handling the cases where `l` is empty or not.***
