Example Answer:
The absolute difference between each element in list `l` and the median of list `l` is calculated, and the sum of these absolute differences is appended to the list `af`. The list `l` being evaluated as True does not impact the calculation. The list `le` being empty and `n` being a valid integer value also do not affect the calculation. However, an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences between each element in list `l` and the median of list `l`, an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list, `le` is empty, `n` is a valid integer value, and `l` is evaluated as True.
Output State: **`af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences between each element in list `l` and the median of list `l`, an IndexError is raised due to popping from an empty list, `le` is empty, `n` is a valid integer value, and `l` is evaluated as True**
