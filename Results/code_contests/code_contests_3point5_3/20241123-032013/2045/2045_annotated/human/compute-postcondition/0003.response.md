Example Answer:
The value popped from the list `le` is converted to an integer using `int()` and assigned to `n`. Since it is specified that `le` has at least one element to pop and the result of `int(le.pop())` is a valid integer, we can safely assume that `n` will have a valid integer value after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is an empty list, `le` is empty, and `n` is a valid integer value.
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` is empty, and `n` is a valid integer value**
