Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly by splitting the input and reversing it to read the test cases in the correct order.
2. It correctly calculates the minimum number of moves needed to line up the sheep in each test case.
3. The logic of the program is based on finding the positions of the sheep, calculating the absolute difference between each position and the median position, and summing up these differences to get the total moves required.
4. The output is printed in the required format for each test case.

Overall, the program seems to be handling the given problem description correctly, and all the test cases provided in the problem description are covered.
