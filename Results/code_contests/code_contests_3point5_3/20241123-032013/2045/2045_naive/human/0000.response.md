Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes the input for the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of moves required to line up the sheep by finding the median sheep position and summing the absolute differences between each sheep position and the median position.
- The program then outputs the minimum number of moves for each test case.
- The logic of finding the median sheep position and calculating the sum of absolute differences is correct and aligns with the problem description.
- The program iterates through all test cases and handles each case correctly.
- Based on the provided problem description and the implementation of the program, it appears to be correct for all potential cases.
