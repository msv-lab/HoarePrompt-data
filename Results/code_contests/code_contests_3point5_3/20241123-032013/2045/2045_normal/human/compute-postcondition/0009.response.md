Example Answer: 
The sum of absolute differences between each element `k` in list `l` and the median difference `med` is calculated and appended to list `af`. The elements in list `l` are the differences between each element and its index, and `med` is the median difference at the middle index of the list. After execution, the new element is added to list `af`. Therefore, the Output State is: The elements in `l` are the differences between each element and its index, `med` is the median difference at the middle index of the list, and a new sum of absolute differences has been appended to list `af`.
Output State: **The elements in `l` are the differences between each element and its index, `med` is the median difference at the middle index of the list, and a new sum of absolute differences has been appended to list `af`**
