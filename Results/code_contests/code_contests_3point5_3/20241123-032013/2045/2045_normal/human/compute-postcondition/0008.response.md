Example Answer:
The median `med` is assigned the value of the element at index `len(l) // 2` in the list `l`. Since the list `l` is not empty and the elements in `l` are the differences between each element and its index in the original list, the median `med` will be the difference at the middle index of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: The elements in `l` are the differences between each element and its index in the original list, `med` is the median difference at the middle index of the list.
Output State: **The elements in `l` are the differences between each element and its index in the original list, `med` is the median difference at the middle index of the list**
