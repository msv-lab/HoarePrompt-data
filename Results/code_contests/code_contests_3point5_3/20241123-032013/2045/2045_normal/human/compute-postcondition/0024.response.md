Example Answer:
The value of `l` is updated with the next popped element from `le`, which means `l` now holds the value that was removed from `le`. The value of `n` is then assigned the same value as `l`. `med` is reassigned based on the updated value of `l`, and a new element is appended to `af` based on the updated value of `med`. 
Output State: **`l` is updated with the next popped element from `le`, `n` is assigned the value of the next popped element from `le`, `med` is reassigned based on the updated `l`, and a new element is appended to `af` based on the updated `med`**
