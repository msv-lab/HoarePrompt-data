The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. Instead, it relies on the input provided within the function itself. The constraints for the input are as follows: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the level string, and the string consists of '.' and '*' characters.

The function will process the test cases internally and output the desired result based on the input constraints.
