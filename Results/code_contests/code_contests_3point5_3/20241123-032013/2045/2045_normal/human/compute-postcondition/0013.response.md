According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in list `le`. If `le` is not empty, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, the elements in `l` are the differences between each element and its index in the original list. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the median difference at the middle index of the list. Then, a new sum of absolute differences based on `med` has been appended to list `af`. If `l` is empty, `af` contains an additional element which is 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `le` must have at least one element remaining to pop.
