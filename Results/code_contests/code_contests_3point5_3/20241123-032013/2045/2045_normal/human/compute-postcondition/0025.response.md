Example Answer:
The list comprehension iterates through the range of `n`, filtering elements from `l` that are equal to '*'. The elements that meet this condition are stored in `l`. The values of `n` and `med` are not affected by this operation. A new element is appended to `af` based on the updated `med`. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is updated with elements from `le`, `n` is assigned a value from `le`, `med` is reassigned based on the updated `l`, and a new element is appended to `af` based on the updated `med`.
Output State: **`l` is updated with elements from `le`, `n` is assigned a value from `le`, `med` is reassigned based on the updated `l`, and a new element is appended to `af` based on the updated `med`**
