Example Answer: 
The value popped from the list `le` is converted to an integer and assigned to variable `n`. The list `af` is unaffected by this operation. Since the popped value is a valid integer, `n` will hold that value. 
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, value popped from `le` is a valid integer, `zorg` iterates over the range of this integer value, `n` is the integer value popped from `le`**
