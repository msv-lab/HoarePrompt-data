Output State: The code will print each element in the list `af` separated by a new line. If `l` is not empty, the median difference `med` will be calculated, and a new sum of absolute differences based on `med` will be appended to `af`. If `l` is empty, `af` will contain an additional element which is 0. If the initial list `le` is empty or does not contain enough elements to pop during the loop, the loop will not execute, and `af` will remain an empty list.
