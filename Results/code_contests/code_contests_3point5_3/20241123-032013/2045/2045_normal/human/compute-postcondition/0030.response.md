Postcondition: ***`l` is updated with elements based on subtraction, `n` is assigned a value from `le`, `med` is reassigned based on the updated `l`, and a new element is appended to `af` based on the updated `med`. If `l` is not empty, `med` is set to the middle element of `l` and the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med` is appended to `af`. If `l` is empty, `med` is set to the middle element of `l`, which is 0, and 0 is appended to `af`.***
