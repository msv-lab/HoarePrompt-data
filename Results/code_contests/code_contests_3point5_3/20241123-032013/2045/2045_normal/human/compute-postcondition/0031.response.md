According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `le`. If `le` still has elements left to pop and `zorg` is less than the popped element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is updated with elements based on subtraction, `n` is assigned a value from `le`, `med` is reassigned based on the updated `l`, and a new element is appended to `af` based on the updated `med`. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration, `le` should still have elements left to pop, and `zorg` should be less than the new value popped from `le`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`l` is updated with elements based on subtraction, `n` is assigned a value from `le`, `med` is reassigned based on the updated `l`, and a new element is appended to `af` based on the updated `med`, `le` still has elements left to pop, `zorg` is less than the new value popped from `le`.**
