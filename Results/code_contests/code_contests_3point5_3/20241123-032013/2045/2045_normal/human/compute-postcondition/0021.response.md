Postcondition: ***The elements in `l` are the differences between each element and its index in the original list. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the median difference at the middle index of the list. A new sum of absolute differences based on `med` has been appended to list `af`. If `l` is empty, `af` contains an additional element which is 0. `le` has at least one element remaining to pop, and `n` is assigned the value of the popped element from `le`. `l` is updated to have the popped element from `le`. If `l` is not empty, `med` is assigned the value of the median difference at the middle index of the list. If `l` is empty, `med` is not defined. In both cases, `af` will have a new element appended, either the sum of absolute differences based on `med` or 0.***
