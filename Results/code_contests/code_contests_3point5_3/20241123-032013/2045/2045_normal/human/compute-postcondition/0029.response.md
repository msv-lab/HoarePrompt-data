Example Answer: 
A new element `0` is appended to the list `af`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is updated with elements based on subtraction, `n` is assigned a value from `le`, `med` is reassigned based on the updated `l`, and a new element `0` is appended to `af`.
Output State: **`l` is updated with elements based on subtraction, `n` is assigned a value from `le`, `med` is reassigned based on the updated `l`, and a new element `0` is appended to `af`**
