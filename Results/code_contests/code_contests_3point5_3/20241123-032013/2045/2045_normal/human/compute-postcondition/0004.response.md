Example Answer:
The value `l` is assigned the integer value popped from the list `le`. Since `le` is popped, it will have one less element. The variable `n` also holds the same integer value as `l`, and `zorg` iterates over the range of this integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is an empty list, value popped from `le` is a valid integer, `zorg` iterates over the range of this integer value, `n` is the integer value popped from `le`.
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, value popped from `le` is a valid integer, `zorg` iterates over the range of this integer value, `n` is the integer value popped from `le`**
