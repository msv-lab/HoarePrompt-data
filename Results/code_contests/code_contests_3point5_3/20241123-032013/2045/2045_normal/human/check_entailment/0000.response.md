Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code does not seem to follow the problem description accurately. The code processes the input by calculating the absolute differences between elements in a list based on a median value. However, the description of the problem is related to a game scenario where sheep need to be lined up by moving them left or right. The code does not seem to simulate this game scenario accurately. 

Additionally, the output hints suggest that the function reads input from the standard input, processes the data based on specific constraints, and calculates absolute differences based on a median value, which further confirms that the code does not align with the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
