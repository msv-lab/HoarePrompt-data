Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the positions of the two points on the clock face corresponding to the hour and minute hands based on the input values of A, B, H, and M. It then computes the Euclidean distance between these two points and prints the result. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it accurately handles the rotation of the clock hands and calculates the distance between the two points correctly. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
