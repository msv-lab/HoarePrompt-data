Example Answer:
The value of `t1` is calculated based on the formula `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`. The variables `h` and `m` are used in the calculation, and their values are provided as input. The value of `t1` is dependent on the input values of `h` and `m`. 
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces; `t1` is calculated based on the formula `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`**
