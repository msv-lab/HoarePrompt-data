Example Answer: 
`t2` is assigned the value of `radians(m % 60 * 6)`. The values of `m` can vary, but based on the formula, `m % 60 * 6` will always yield a value in the range of 0 to 354 degrees. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces; `t1` is calculated based on the formula `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`, and `t2` is always in the range of 0 to 354 degrees.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces; `t1` is calculated based on the formula `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`, and `t2` is always in the range of 0 to 354 degrees**
