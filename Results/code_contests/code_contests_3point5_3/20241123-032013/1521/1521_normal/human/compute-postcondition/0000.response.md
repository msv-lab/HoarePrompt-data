Example Answer:
The code snippet sets up the standard input to read input from a BytesIO stream. This does not directly affect the values of A, B, H, or M. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000, H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11, and M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59**
