The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses the integers A, B, H, and M with the constraints provided. The function calculates the total number of minutes passed since midnight based on the values of H and M, and the total number of minutes in a day based on A and B. The function then returns the difference between the total number of minutes in a day and the total number of minutes passed since midnight as the output.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the remaining minutes in a day based on the values of A, B, H, and M without accepting any parameters explicitly.
