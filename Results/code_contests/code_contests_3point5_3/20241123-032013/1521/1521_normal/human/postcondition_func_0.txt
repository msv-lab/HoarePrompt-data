The function `func` reads input values for A, B, H, and M from standard input. It then calculates the positions of two points on a clock face based on the input values. After calculating the positions, it computes the Euclidean distance between these two points and prints the result. The function does not accept any explicit parameters and is designed to handle the clock face calculations based on the provided constraints.
