Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hands on an analog clock based on the input values of A, B, H, and M. The program uses the provided formulas to calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands and then calculates the distance between the endpoints using the Euclidean distance formula. 

The program handles all potential cases within the specified constraints, including the values of A and B ranging from 1 to 1000, H ranging from 0 to 11, and M ranging from 0 to 59. 

Additionally, the output format is also correctly followed, with the distance printed without units and with the required precision. 

Since the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases and produces the expected output, the correctness of the program is **True**.
