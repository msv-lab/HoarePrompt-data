Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code correctly calculates the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hour and minute hands of an analog clock based on the input parameters A, B, H, and M. The code correctly converts the input hours and minutes into radians for both hands, calculates the x and y coordinates of the endpoints, and then computes the distance between the two points using the distance formula. The code follows the problem description accurately and provides the expected output. Additionally, the code handles all potential cases within the given constraints.
