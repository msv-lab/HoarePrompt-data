The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the current time in 24-hour format as a string in the form "HH:MM". The hours portion (HH) is represented by the integer A, the minutes portion (MM) is represented by the integer B, and the time of day is indicated by "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hours portion is before or after noon (12:00). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return the current time in 24-hour format as a string.
