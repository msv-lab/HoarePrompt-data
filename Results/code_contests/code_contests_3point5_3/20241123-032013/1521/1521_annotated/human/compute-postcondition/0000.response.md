Example Answer:
The code snippet sets up the standard input to read from a byte stream. This code does not directly affect the state of the variables A, B, H, or M. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000. H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11. M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59**
