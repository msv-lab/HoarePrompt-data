Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is the result of the calculation using H and M; t2 is the result of the calculation using M % 60 * 6 in radians; x1 is assigned the value of -A * sin(-t1); y1 is assigned the value of A * cos(-t1); y2 = b * cos(-t2); print(((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5)**
