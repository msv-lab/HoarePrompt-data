Example Answer:
t2 is assigned the value of the calculation using m % 60 * 6 in radians. The value of m can range from 0 to 59, so t2 will be calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is the result of the calculation using H and M; t2 is the result of the calculation using m % 60 * 6 in radians.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is the result of the calculation using H and M; t2 is the result of the calculation using m % 60 * 6 in radians**
