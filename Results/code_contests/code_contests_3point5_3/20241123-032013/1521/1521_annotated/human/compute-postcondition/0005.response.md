Example Answer:
a, b, h, and m are assigned values based on the input split by spaces. The values of a and b are integers between 1 and 1000, and the values of h and m are integers between 0 and 59. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59**
