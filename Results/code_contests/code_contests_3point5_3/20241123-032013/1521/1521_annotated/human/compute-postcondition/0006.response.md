Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned the value of `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`. The values of `h` and `m` are used in the calculation, where `h` is an integer between 0 and 11, and `m` is an integer between 0 and 59. The output state is: A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is the result of the calculation using H and M.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is the result of the calculation using H and M**
