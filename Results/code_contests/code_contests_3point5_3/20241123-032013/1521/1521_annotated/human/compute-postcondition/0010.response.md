Example Answer: 
`x2` is assigned the value of `-B * sin(-t2)`, where `t2` is calculated using `M % 60 * 6` in radians. The values of `B` and `t2` are not provided, so the exact value of `x2` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is the result of the calculation using H and M; t2 is the result of the calculation using M % 60 * 6 in radians; x1 is assigned the value of -A * sin(-t1); y1 is assigned the value of A * cos(-t1).
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is the result of the calculation using H and M; t2 is the result of the calculation using M % 60 * 6 in radians; x1 is assigned the value of -A * sin(-t1); y1 is assigned the value of A * cos(-t1)**
