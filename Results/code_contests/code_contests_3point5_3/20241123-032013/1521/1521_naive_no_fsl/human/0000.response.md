Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hour and minute hands on an analog clock based on the input values of A, B, H, and M. The program uses the trigonometric functions sin and cos to calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands at the specified time, and then calculates the distance between the two endpoints using the distance formula. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
