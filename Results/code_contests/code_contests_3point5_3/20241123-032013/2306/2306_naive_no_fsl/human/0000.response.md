Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly implement the process described in the problem statement. The program calculates the value of `res` based on the prefix sum of the given string `s`, which does not match the process described in the problem.

In the given process, the value of `res` is calculated by iterating over the characters of the string and incrementing `res` for each character. The loop should break as soon as the condition `cur < 0` is met for any value of `cur`. However, the provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
