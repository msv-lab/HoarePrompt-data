Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it follows the provided problem description accurately. It calculates the value of 'res' after the process ends as described in the pseudocode. The function 'func_1' reads the input string and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces. The main logic of the program implements the process described in the problem statement. It iterates over the characters of the input string, updates the 'res' variable, and checks the condition 'cur < 0' to determine if the loop should break or continue. The program handles all possible cases and correctly calculates the value of 'res' for each test case.
