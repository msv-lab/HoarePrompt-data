Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by taking input for the number of sides and the lengths of each side, calculating the sum of all sides, finding the longest side, and then checking if the longest side is shorter than the sum of the other sides. If the condition is satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output.
