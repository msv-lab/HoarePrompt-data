Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `listL` from user input. It then calculates the sum of all elements in the list and finds the maximum value. After that, it subtracts the maximum value from the sum. If the maximum value is less than the updated sum, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and it operates based on the input provided during execution.**
