According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL contains the integers inputted by the user, maxL is the maximum value from listL, sum is the sum of elements in listL up to index 1 + listL[i], and i is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **Output State: N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL contains the integers inputted by the user, maxL is the maximum value from listL, sum is the sum of elements in listL up to index 1 + listL[i], i is 2**
