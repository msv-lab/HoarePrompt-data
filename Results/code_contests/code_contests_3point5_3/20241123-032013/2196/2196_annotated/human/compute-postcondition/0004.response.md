According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. As N is given to be an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, the loop will always execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL contains the integers inputted by the user, maxL is the maximum value from listL, sum is 0, i is 0**
