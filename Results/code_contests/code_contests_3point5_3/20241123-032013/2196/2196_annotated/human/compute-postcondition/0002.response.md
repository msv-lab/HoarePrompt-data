Example Answer:
The variable `maxL` is assigned the maximum value from the list `listL`. Since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, and the list contains integers inputted by the user, the maximum value of the list can be any integer within that range. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL contains the integers inputted by the user, maxL is the maximum value from listL.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL contains the integers inputted by the user, maxL is the maximum value from listL**
