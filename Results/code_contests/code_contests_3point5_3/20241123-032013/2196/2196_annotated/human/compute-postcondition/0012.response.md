Example Answer: 
The value of 'sum' is updated by subtracting the value of 'maxL'. If the loop did not execute (N < 3), 'sum' remains 0. 'maxL' is the maximum value from listL. 'i' is the index of the last element added to 'sum'. Therefore, the Output State is: 'sum' is updated by subtracting 'maxL', 'maxL' remains the same, 'i' remains the same.
Output State: **'sum' is updated by subtracting 'maxL', 'maxL' remains the same, 'i' remains the same**
