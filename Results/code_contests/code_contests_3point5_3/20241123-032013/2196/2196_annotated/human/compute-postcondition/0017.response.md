Postcondition: ***'sum', 'maxL', 'i' are integers. If 'maxL' is less than 'sum', then 'sum' is updated by subtracting 'maxL', 'maxL' remains the same, and 'i' remains the same. The program prints 'Yes'. If 'maxL' is not less than 'sum', then 'sum' is updated by subtracting 'maxL', 'maxL' remains the same, and 'i' remains the same. The program prints 'No'.***
