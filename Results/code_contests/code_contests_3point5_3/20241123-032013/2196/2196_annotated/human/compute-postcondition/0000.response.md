Example Answer:
N is assigned the value of int(input()), where input accepts an input and int converts it to an integer. Since the value of N must be between 3 and 10, the possible values for N are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Therefore, the Output State is N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10**
