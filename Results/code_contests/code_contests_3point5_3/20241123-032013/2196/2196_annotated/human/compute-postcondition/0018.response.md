The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the preconditions that `N` is an integer where 3 <= N <= 10, and `L_1, L_2, ..., L_N` are integers where 1 <= L_i <= 100. The function performs a specific task or computation based on these preconditions and returns a certain output.
