Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and logic provided in the theorem. It calculates the sum of all sides except the longest side and then checks if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the other sides. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The program handles the constraints and all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
