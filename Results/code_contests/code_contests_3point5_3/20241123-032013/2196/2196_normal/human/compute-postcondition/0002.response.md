Example Answer:
maxL is assigned the maximum value in listL using the max() function. The values in listL are inputted by the user, and N is an integer between 3 and 10. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL is a list containing integers inputted from the user, maxL is the maximum value in listL.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL is a list containing integers inputted from the user, maxL is the maximum value in listL**
