According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL is a list containing integers inputted from the user, maxL is the maximum value in listL, sum is the sum of elements in listL up to index i, and i is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented to move to the next iteration. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **Output State: N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL is a list containing integers inputted from the user, maxL is the maximum value in listL, sum is the sum of elements in listL up to index i, i is 1**
