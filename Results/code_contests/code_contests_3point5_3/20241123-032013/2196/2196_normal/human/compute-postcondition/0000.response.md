Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `N` will be between 3 and 10 based on the given precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10**
