The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the preconditions that were specified. It takes an integer `N` where 3 <= N <= 10, and a list of integers L_1, L_2, ..., L_N where each L_i is an integer within the range 1 <= L_i <= 100. The function does not return any value, but it performs some operations based on the input values N and the list L.
