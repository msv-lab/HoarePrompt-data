Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the element at index `i` of `listL` to the current value of `sum`. Since `i` is 1, the element at index 1 of `listL` is added to `sum`. The value of `sum` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL is a list containing integers inputted from the user, maxL is the maximum value in listL, `sum` is the updated sum of elements in `listL` up to index `i`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL is a list containing integers inputted from the user, maxL is the maximum value in listL, `sum` is the updated sum of elements in `listL` up to index `i`, `i` is 1**
