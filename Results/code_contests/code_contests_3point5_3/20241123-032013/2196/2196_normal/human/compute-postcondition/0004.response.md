According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. Since N is already given as an integer, the loop will execute. However, to ensure the loop executes properly, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, listL is a list containing integers inputted from the user, maxL is the maximum value in listL, sum is 0, i is 0**
