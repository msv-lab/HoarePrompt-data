The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `L` from the user input. It calculates the sum of elements in the list `L`, subtracts the maximum value from the sum, and then compares the maximum value with the updated sum. If the maximum value is less than the updated sum, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function only operates correctly if N is between 3 and 10 inclusive. It does not return any value.
