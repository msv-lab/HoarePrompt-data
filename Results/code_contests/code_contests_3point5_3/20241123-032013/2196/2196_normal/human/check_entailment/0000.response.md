Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `L` from the user input. It calculates the sum of elements in the list `L`, subtracts the maximum value from the sum, and then compares the maximum value with the updated sum. If the maximum value is less than the updated sum, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The code handles all potential cases and satisfies the constraints given in the problem description. The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the code.
