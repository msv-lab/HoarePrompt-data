The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs a calculation within a loop based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `p`. The function returns the final value of variable `res` after the loop execution, which is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. The loop updates `res`, `y`, and `x` according to specific rules. If `y` is positive, the loop executes; otherwise, it does not. The function handles the cases where `y` is 0 or negative by not executing the loop and maintaining specific values.
