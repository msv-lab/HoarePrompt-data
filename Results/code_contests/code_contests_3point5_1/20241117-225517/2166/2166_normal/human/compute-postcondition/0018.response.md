Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. Since the previous value of `at_start` is already `False`, there is no change in the state of any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: 'sep' is ' ', 'file' has the string representation of the third element in 'args', 'at_start' is False.
Output State: **'sep' is ' ', 'file' has the string representation of the third element in 'args', 'at_start' is False**
