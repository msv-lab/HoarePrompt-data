Postcondition: ***The loop iterates through the elements in 'args', checks 'at_start', writes 'sep' if 'at_start' is False, writes the string representation of 'x' to 'file', sets 'at_start' to False, 'args' is empty. The function pops the value associated with 'flush' key from kwargs, if present, and it is False***
