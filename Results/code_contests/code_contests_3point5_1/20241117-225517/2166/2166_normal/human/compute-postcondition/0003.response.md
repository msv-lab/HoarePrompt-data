According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the args list. If args has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, 'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, 'at_start' is True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to args has at least 1 element, and x is the first element in args.
State: **'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, 'at_start' is True, args has at least 1 element, x is the first element in args**
