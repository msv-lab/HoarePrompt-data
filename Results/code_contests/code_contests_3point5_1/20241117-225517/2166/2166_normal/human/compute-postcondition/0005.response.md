Example Answer:
The `write` method of the file object `file` writes the string stored in the variable `sep`. Since `sep` is a space character, a space will be written to the file. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, 'at_start' is False, args has at least 1 element, x is the first element in args`.
Output State: **'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, 'at_start' is False, args has at least 1 element, x is the first element in args**
