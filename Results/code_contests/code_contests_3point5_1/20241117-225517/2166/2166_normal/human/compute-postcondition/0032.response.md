Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, a is a list of positive integers, ans is 0, i and j are either incremented or decremented based on the condition, b is a list containing elements from a[i] or a[j] depending on the condition with the new appended element, f is toggled between 0 and 1, k is 2. If f is 0, b contains all previous elements from a[i] or a[j] and a new element a[j], j is decremented by 1, f is toggled to its opposite value. If f is 1, b contains all previous elements from a[i] or a[j] and a new element a[i], i is incremented by 1, f is toggled to its opposite value.***
