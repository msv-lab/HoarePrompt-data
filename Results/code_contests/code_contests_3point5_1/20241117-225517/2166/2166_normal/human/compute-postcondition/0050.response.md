Functionality: **The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It assumes there are two predefined variables: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` different positive integers. The function iterates through the list `a` in an alternating fashion, appending elements to a new list `b`. It then checks for a specific condition in `b` elements and increments `ans` accordingly. Finally, it calls two other functions `func_20` with different arguments. The function does not return any value.**
