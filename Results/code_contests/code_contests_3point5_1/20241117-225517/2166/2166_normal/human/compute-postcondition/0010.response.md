Example Answer:
The `write` method of `file` is called with the value of `sep`, which is a space character. This will write a space to the output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, 'at_start' is False, 'args' has at least 2 elements where x is the second element.
Output State: **'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, 'at_start' is False, 'args' has at least 2 elements where x is the second element**
