Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of the third element in the 'args' list to the 'file'. If 'at_start' is False, then the 'sep' value, which is a space, is written to 'file'. Therefore, the output state is: 'sep' is ' ', 'file' has the string representation of the third element in 'args', 'at_start' is False.
Output State: **'sep' is ' ', 'file' has the string representation of the third element in 'args', 'at_start' is False**
