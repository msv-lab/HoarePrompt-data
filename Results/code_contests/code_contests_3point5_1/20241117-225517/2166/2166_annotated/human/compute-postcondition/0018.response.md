Example Answer: 
The value of at_start is set to False, which means that file.write(sep) will be executed in the next steps. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, at_start is False, args is a list with at least 3 elements where the next element after x becomes the new x for the next iteration.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, at_start is False, args is a list with at least 3 elements where the next element after x becomes the new x for the next iteration**
