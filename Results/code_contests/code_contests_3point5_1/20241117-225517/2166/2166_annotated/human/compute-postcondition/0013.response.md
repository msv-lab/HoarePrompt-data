Example Answer: 
The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This will have an impact on the program flow depending on the conditionals in the code. Other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, at_start is False, args is a list with at least 2 elements where x is the first element.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, at_start is False, args is a list with at least 2 elements where x is the first element**
