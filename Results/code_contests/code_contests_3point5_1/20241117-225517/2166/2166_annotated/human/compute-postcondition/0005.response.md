Example Answer:
The function `write` is called with the argument `sep`. The value of `sep` is not provided in the initial state, so it is unknown. The function `write` typically writes the argument to a file, but without knowing the value of `sep`, we cannot determine the exact impact on the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and they are all different, at_start is False, args is a list with at least 1 element where x is the first element**
