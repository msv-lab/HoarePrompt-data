Example Answer: 
The code snippet provided is a docstring explaining the purpose of a function that prints values to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default. This code does not affect any variables or change the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and they are all different.**
