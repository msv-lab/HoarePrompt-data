Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the default values ' ' and sys.stdout to the variables 'sep' and 'file' respectively. The previous values of 'sep' and 'file' are not provided, so the output state is: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and they are all different.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and they are all different**
