Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of `x` to a file. The value of `x` is positive integer, therefore the output state is unchanged except for writing the string representation of `x` to the file.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, at_start is False, args is a list with at least 3 elements where the next element after x becomes the new x for the next iteration. If at_start is False, file.write(sep). If at_start is True, no operation is performed. The string representation of x is written to the file.**
