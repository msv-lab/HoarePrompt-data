Postcondition: ***If args is an empty list, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, at_start is False, args is a list with n elements, each element is written to the file separated by "sep", and the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is written to the file. Additionally, if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, then the file is flushed.***
