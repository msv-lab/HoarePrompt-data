Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is not given in the initial state, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, at_start is False, args is a list with at least 2 elements where x is the first element**
