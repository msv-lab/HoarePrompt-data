Example Answer:
The value of `x` is written to the file. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. If `at_start` is True, then the value of `x` will be written to the file. If `at_start` is False, then "sep" will be written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: *n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and they are all different, at_start is True or False, args is a list with at least 1 element where x is the first element. If at_start is False, then "sep" is written to the file. Otherwise, value of `x` is written to the file.
