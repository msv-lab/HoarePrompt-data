Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, j and i are updated based on f, f is toggled, a retains its original value from func_5(), ans is 2, b contains the appended elements from list a based on the toggling of f, i is less than n - 2, conditions for b[i] in the loop body are met. If b[i] is less than both b[i - 1] and b[i + 1], then ans is incremented by 1.***
