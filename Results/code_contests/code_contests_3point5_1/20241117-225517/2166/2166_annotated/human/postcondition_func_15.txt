The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It swaps the values of `x` and `y` using a while loop until `y` becomes zero. If `y` is non-zero, the loop executes at least once. After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `x` after the swap. If `y` is initially zero, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the original value of `x`.
