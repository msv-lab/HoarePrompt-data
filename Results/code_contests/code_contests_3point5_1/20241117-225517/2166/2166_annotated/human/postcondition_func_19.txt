The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args` and writes them to a file, separated by the specified separator. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute. After writing all elements, the function writes the value specified by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the file is flushed. However, the function lacks initial input parameters and may not operate as intended due to missing context.
