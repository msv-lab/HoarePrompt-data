The function func_15 accepts three positive integer parameters x, y, and p, and calculates the result of performing modular exponentiation on x and y with base p. It iteratively updates the result by squaring x and taking the modulo p, shifting y to the right, and multiplying x by itself modulo p. The function returns the final result after the loop is executed.
