Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the problem description, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The program reorders the ice spheres in a way that Sage can buy the maximum number of cheap ice spheres. The functions in the program handle user input, sorting, and reordering of the ice spheres effectively.

The program iterates through the ice spheres, toggling between appending from the left and right sides to ensure that the cheap ice spheres are selected. It then counts the number of cheap ice spheres that can be bought based on the reordering. The output is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Since the program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed as True.
