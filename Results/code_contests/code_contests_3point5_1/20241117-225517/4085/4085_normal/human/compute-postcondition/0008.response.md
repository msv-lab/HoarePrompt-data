Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces. `q2` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces. `q3` contains the inputs split by spaces. `s1` is an integer value, `s2` is now equal to the first input value. `f` is assigned the value 0. `p1` is assigned the value 0. `p2` is assigned the value 0. `a1` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `q1`**
