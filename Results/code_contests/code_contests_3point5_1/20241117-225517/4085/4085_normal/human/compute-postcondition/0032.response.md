Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1`, `q2`, `q3` contain inputs split by spaces. `s1` is a non-negative integer, `s2` is 0. `f` is incremented by 2, `p1` is incremented by 3, `p2` is assigned the value 2. `a1` and `a2` are assigned the integer values of the first and second elements in `q1`. After the execution of the if statement, the condition `(s1 == s2)` holds. If `s1` was less than `s2`, then `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`, and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`. If `s1` was greater than `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1, and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`. `p1` needs to be incremented by either 1 or 2, `p2` needs to be incremented by 1.**
