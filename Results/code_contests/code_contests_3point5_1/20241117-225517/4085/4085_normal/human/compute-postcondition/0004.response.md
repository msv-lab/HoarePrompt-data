Example Answer:
`s2` is assigned the integer value at the 0th index of list `q3`, which represents the first input value. Therefore, `s2` is now equal to the first input value. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces. `q2` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces. `q3` contains the inputs split by spaces. `s1` is an integer value, `s2` is now equal to the first input value**
