Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1`, `q2`, `q3` contain inputs split by spaces. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0, `f` is incremented by 3, `p1` is incremented by either 2, 3, 5, or 6, `p2` is incremented by 1, `a1` and `a2` are assigned the integer values of the first and second elements in `q1`, and `p2` is incremented by 1.***
