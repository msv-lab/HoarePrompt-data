Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1`, `q2`, `q3` contain inputs split by spaces. `s1` is now less than `s2`, `s2` is equal to 0. `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is assigned the value 2. `a1`, `a2` are assigned the integer values of the first and second elements in `q1` respectively. The condition `(s1 == s2)` is true and `p2` is incremented by 1.***
