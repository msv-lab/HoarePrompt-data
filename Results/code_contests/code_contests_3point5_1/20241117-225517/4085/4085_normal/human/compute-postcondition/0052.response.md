Output State: **If p1 is less than a1 and p2 is less than a2, the loop will execute at least once. After one iteration, s1 and s2 are both 0, f is incremented by 1, p1 is incremented by 1, p2 is incremented by 1, a1 and a2 are the first and second elements of q1 respectively. Additionally, if s1 < s2, then p1 is incremented by 1 and s1 is updated to s1 + int(q2[p1]). If s1 > s2, p2 is incremented by 1 and s2 is updated to s2 + int(q3[p2]).**
Output State: **If p1 is less than a1 and p2 is less than a2, the loop will execute at least twice. After two iterations, f is incremented by 2, p1 is incremented by either 4 or 5, p2 is 2 or 3, s1 is updated to either s1 + int(q2[p1]) or s1 + int(q2[p1 + 1]), s2 is updated to int(q3[p2]). a1 and a2 are the first and second elements of q1. If s1 < s2, then p1 is incremented by either 4 or 5, and s1 is updated accordingly. If s1 > s2, p2 is incremented by 1 and s2 is updated to s2 + int(q3[p2]).**
Output State: **If p1 is less than a1 and p2 is less than a2, the loop will execute at least three times. After three iterations, f is incremented by 3, p1 is incremented by either 2, 3, 5, or 6, p2 is incremented by 1, a1 and a2 are the first and second elements of q1. If s1 equals s2, both are set to 0. If s1 < s2, p1 is incremented by 2, 3, 5, or 6, and s1 is updated to s1 + int(q2[p1]). If s1 > s2, p2 is incremented by 1 and s2 is updated to s2 + int(q3[p2]).**
