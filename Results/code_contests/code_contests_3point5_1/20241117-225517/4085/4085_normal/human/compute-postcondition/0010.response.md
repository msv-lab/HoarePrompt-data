Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1`, `q2`, `q3` contain inputs split by spaces. `s1` is an integer value, `s2` is now equal to the first input value. `f`, `p1`, `p2` are assigned the value 0. `a1`, `a2` are assigned the integer values of the first and second elements in `q1` respectively. The condition `(s1 == s2)` is true***
