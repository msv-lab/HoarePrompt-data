Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1`, `q2`, `q3` contain inputs split by spaces. `s1` is a non-negative integer either incremented by int(q2[p1]) or int(q2[p1 + 1]), `s2` is 0 or updated to int(q3[p2]). `f` is incremented by 2, `p1` is incremented by 4 or 5, `p2` is assigned the value 2 or incremented by 1. `a1` and `a2` are assigned the integer values of the first and second elements in `q1`. After the execution of the if statement, the condition `(s1 == s2)` holds. If `s1` was less than `s2`, then `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])` or `s1 + int(q2[p1 + 1])`, and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`. If `s1` was greater than `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1, and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`. `p1` needs to be incremented by either 1, 2, 4, or 5, `p2` needs to be incremented by 1. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2]). Otherwise, there is no change in the variables `s1` and `s2`.***
