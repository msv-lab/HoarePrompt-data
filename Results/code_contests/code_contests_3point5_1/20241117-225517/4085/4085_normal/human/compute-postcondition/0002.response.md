Example Answer:
`q3` is assigned the value `raw_input().split()`. The function `raw_input()` accepts user input and `split()` splits the input based on spaces. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces. `q2` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces. `q3` contains the inputs split by spaces.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces. `q2` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces. `q3` contains the inputs split by spaces.**
