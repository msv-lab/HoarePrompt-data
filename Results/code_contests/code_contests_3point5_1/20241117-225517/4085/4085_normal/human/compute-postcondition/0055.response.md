Functionality: **The function reads input data, processes it to verify if the sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message, and then prints the result. It iterates over the input data to update the block lengths and counters accordingly. However, the function lacks input validation and error handling for cases where the input data is missing or not well-formed.**
