Example Answer: 
`s2` is assigned the value of `s2 + int(q3[p2])`, where `p2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p2` is unknown, so the new value is `p2 + 1`. The value of `q3[p2]` is added to `s2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p2` is incremented by 1, `s2` is updated based on the new value of `p2`.
Output State: **`p2` is incremented by 1, `s2` is updated based on the new value of `p2`**
