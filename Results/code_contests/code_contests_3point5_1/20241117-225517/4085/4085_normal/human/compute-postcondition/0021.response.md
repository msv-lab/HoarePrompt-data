Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. `x1, x2, ..., xn` and `y1, y2, ..., ym` are positive integers representing the lengths of blocks in the first and second messages respectively. The sum of lengths of blocks in the first message is equal to the sum of lengths of blocks in the second message. `q1`, `q2`, `q3` contain inputs split by spaces. `s1` and `s2` are non-negative integers such that `s1` is less than or equal to `s2. `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by either 1 or 2, and `p2` is assigned the value 1 or 2 depending on the execution path. `a1` and `a2` are assigned the integer values of the first and second elements in `q1` respectively. The condition `(s1 == s2)` holds after the execution of the if statement. If `s1` was less than `s2`, then `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`.***
