Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to determine the maximum number of files that could be in the archive given the lengths of blocks in each message. However, the code does not properly handle the scenarios where the input data is missing or not well-formed. Additionally, the code lacks proper validation and error handling.

Based on the output hints, the code should iterate over the input data to update block lengths and counters accordingly. However, due to the issues mentioned above, the code does not seem to be able to accurately determine the maximum number of files in the archive in all cases.
