Example Answer:
The value of `p1` is incremented by 1. Then, the value of `q2[p1]` is converted to an integer and added to the current value of `s1`. Based on the initial state, after execution, the output state will be: `p1` is incremented by 1, `s1` is updated with the sum of the current `s1` and the integer value of `q2[p1]`.
Output State: **`p1` is incremented by 1, `s1` is updated with the sum of the current `s1` and the integer value of `q2[p1]`**
