Postcondition: ***`f`, `p1`, `p2`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1` are integers. If `s1` > `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated to its previous value plus the integer representation of the character at index `p2` in `q3`. In all other cases, no changes are made to any variables. If `s1` < `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are each incremented by 1, and `a1` retains its initial value as the integer representation of the first character of `q1`. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated to its previous value plus the integer representation of the character at index `p1` in `q2`.***
