Output State: **If `a1` is less than or equal to 0 or `a2` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If `a1` is positive and `a2` is positive, then after the loop executes, `s1` and `s2` will be modified based on the conditions within the loop. If `s1` is less than `s2`, `s1` and `s2` will be set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` will be incremented by 1. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, `p2` will be incremented by 1 and `s2` will be updated. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, `s1` and `s2` will be set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` will be incremented by 1. At the end of the loop, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `s1`, and `s2` will hold integer values.**
