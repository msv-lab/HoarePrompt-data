Example Answer:
`p2` is assigned the value of `p2 + 1`, where `p2` was initially incremented by 1. After execution, `p2` is further incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, `p2` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, `p2` is incremented by 2**
