Example Answer: 
The value of `f` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `f` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is a variable, `p1` is a variable, `p2` is a variable.
Output State: **`s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is a variable, `p1` is a variable, `p2` is a variable**
