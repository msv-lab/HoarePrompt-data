Example Answer: 
`p1` is assigned the value `p1 + 1`, where `p1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p1` is unknown, but `f` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1**
