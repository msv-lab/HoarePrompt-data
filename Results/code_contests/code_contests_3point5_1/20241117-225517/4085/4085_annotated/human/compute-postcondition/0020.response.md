Postcondition: ***`f`, `p1`, `p2`, `s1`, `s2` are integers. If `s1` < `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are each incremented by 1. `a1` retains its initial value which is the integer representation of the first character of `q1`. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, there are no changes to any variables. In addition, if `s1` < `s2`, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `s1` is updated to its previous value plus the integer representation of the character at index `p1` in `q2`. If `s1` is not less than `s2`, no changes are made to any variables.***
