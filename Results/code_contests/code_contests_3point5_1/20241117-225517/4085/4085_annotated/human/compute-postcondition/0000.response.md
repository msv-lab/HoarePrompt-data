Example Answer: 
`q1` is assigned the value returned by `raw_input().split()`. However, the `raw_input()` function does not exist in Python 3, it was used in Python 2. Therefore, this code will result in a syntax error in Python 3. The output state cannot be determined due to the error.
Output State: **SyntaxError: invalid syntax**
