Output State: **`f`, `p1`, `p2` are integers. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are each incremented by 1. `a1` retains its initial value which is the integer representation of the first character of `q1`. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, there are no changes to any variables. `p1` is incremented by 1.**
