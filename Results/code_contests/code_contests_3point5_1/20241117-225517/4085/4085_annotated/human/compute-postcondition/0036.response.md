Output State: 
- If `s1` is equal to `s2`: `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1.
- If `s1` is not equal to `s2`: No changes are made to the variables.
- If `s1 < s2`: `p1` is incremented by 1, `s1` is updated to the sum of the current `s1` and the integer value of `q2[p1]`, and `p2` is incremented by 1.
