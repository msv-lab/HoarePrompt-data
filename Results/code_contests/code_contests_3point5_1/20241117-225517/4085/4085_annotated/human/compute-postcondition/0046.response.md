Example Answer:
The value of `p1` is incremented by 1, and then `s1` is assigned the value of `s1 + int(q2[p1])`. The previous value of `s1` is unknown, but after the addition operation, `s1` will contain the sum of its previous value and the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`. 
Output State: **`p1` is incremented by 1, `s1` is updated with the sum of its previous value and the integer value at index `p1` of `q2`**
