Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user, processes the input based on certain conditions within a loop, and then prints the value of `f`. The loop executes as long as `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. Inside the loop, it compares the values of `s1` and `s2` and updates them accordingly. If `s1` is less than `s2`, both are set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are incremented. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, `p2` is incremented, and `s2` is updated. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, both are set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are incremented. The function does not accept any parameters and only prints the final value of `f`.**
