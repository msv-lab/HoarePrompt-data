Postcondition: ***`s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2` are variables. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1. If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, no changes are made to the variables. If `s1 < s2`, `p1` is incremented by 1, `s1` is updated to the sum of the current `s1` and the integer value of `q2[p1]`, and `p2` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `s1 > s2` after the execution of the if statement, `p2` is incremented by 1, `s2` is updated to the sum of the current `s2` and the integer value of `q3[p2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
