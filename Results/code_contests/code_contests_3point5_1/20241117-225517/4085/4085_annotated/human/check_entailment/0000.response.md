Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of lengths of blocks in two messages, then iterates through the blocks to determine the maximum number of files that could be in the archive. The logic inside the loop correctly updates the lengths of the blocks based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The program calculates the maximum number of files and prints it at the end. The program seems to be handling all cases correctly based on the problem description, and there are no specific cases provided where the program fails. Hence, it can be considered correct.
