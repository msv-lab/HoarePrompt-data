Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program does not consider all possible cases where the files could be split differently in the two messages. The algorithm implemented in the program may not be able to handle all variations of splitting files into blocks in both messages. 

To demonstrate the incorrectness of the program, consider the following example:

Input:
3 3
1 2 3
1 3 2

Output:
2

In this case, the correct output should be 1, as there is only one file in the archive with sizes 6 in both messages. However, the provided program will output 2, as it does not handle this particular case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
