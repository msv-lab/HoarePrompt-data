Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program reads the input values and then iterates through both sets of blocks to determine the maximum number of files the intercepted array could consist of. The program correctly compares the sum of block lengths in both messages and increments the file count accordingly. The logic seems to be correct and handles the scenario described in the problem statement. Additionally, the program uses a while loop to properly traverse both sets of blocks and keeps track of the current sum of block lengths in each message. Overall, the program seems to be correctly implemented based on the problem description.
