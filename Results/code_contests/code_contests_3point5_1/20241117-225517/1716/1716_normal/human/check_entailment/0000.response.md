Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to print 'Impossible' and exit the program if a certain condition is met. However, the function is not being called correctly within the code. This means that the code is not handling the case where it is impossible to find an order of letters in the Latin alphabet such that the names are sorted lexicographically. As a result, the output may not always be correct.

The output hints do agree with the code, mentioning the function `func_1` and its purpose. However, since the function is not being called correctly, the output hints actually highlight the issue with the code rather than providing additional valid cases. Therefore, in this scenario, the correctness of the program is false.
