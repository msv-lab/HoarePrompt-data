Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly determines if there exists an order of letters in the Latin alphabet such that the given names are sorted lexicographically. The program iterates through the names and builds a dependency graph based on the order of letters in each pair of adjacent names. If there is a cycle in the dependency graph, it prints "Impossible". Otherwise, it constructs the modified alphabet by topologically sorting the letters based on the dependency graph. The logic of the program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
