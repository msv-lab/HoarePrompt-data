Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if there exists an order of letters in the Latin alphabet such that the given names are sorted lexicographically. It iterates through the names and builds a graph of dependencies between characters. If at any point it encounters an inconsistency, it prints "Impossible". Otherwise, it constructs the modified alphabet and prints it. The logic of the program seems correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
