The function `func_1` initializes variables and lists, performs comparisons between elements in two lists `a` and `b`, increments counters, creates sets, and computes specific outputs based on certain conditions. It iterates through list `a`, matches elements with list `b`, and updates variables accordingly. The function handles cases where the loop may not execute due to empty input lists or other conditions, ensuring that variables maintain their initial values. It prints specific values like -1, 0, or the calculated sum `ans` based on the conditions met during execution.
