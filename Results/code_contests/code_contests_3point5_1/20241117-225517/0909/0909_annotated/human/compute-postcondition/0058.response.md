According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i` and `ax`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables have specific values based on the conditions met during the if-else block. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` should be increased by 1, `gaps` should append `gl`, `gl` should be set to 0, `special` should be set to False, and `specialgap` should take the value of `gl`.
- If `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` should be set to 0, and `special` should remain False.
- If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` should be set to True, and `gl` should be increased by 1.
- `i` should be increased by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`j`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` are variables based on the logic specified in the program fragment.**
