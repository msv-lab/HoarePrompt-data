Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `j`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, and `specialgap` have been updated based on the specified conditions. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to the value of `gl`. In all other cases, the variables retain their updated values from the loop execution. If the loop does not start due to empty input lists or other conditions, the variables maintain their initial values. `gaps` list appends the value of `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. If gaps list is empty or specialgap is less than k, then ans remains 0. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to the value of `gl`. Otherwise, `specialgap` retains its updated value. The `gaps` list is appended with the value of `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, `ans` is updated accordingly based on the conditions in the program fragment.***
