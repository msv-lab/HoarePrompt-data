Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is increased by 1, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list**
