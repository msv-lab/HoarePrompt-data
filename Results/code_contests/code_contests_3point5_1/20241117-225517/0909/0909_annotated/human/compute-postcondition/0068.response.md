Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` are variables. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `special` is set to False, and `specialgap` is set to 0. Additionally, `gaps` appends `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. Otherwise, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True. In all cases, `gl` is incremented by 1.***
