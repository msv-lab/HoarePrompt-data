Example Answer:
`gl` is appended to the `gaps` list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, all other variables remain unchanged. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, all other variables remain unchanged. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`**
