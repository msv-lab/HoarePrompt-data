Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer (increased by 1 if the condition is met), `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to the element at index `j` in list `b`, then `j` is incremented by 1. This process continues until either `j` is equal to or greater than `m` or `ax` is not equal to the element at index `j` in list `b`.***
