Example Answer:
`special` is assigned the value `False`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 0, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, and `gaps` remain unchanged, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, and `gaps` remain unchanged, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False**
