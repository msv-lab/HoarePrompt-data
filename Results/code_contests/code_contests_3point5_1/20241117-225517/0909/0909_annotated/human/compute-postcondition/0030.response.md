Example Answer:
`gl` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is assigned the value 0, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, and `gaps` remain unchanged, `gl` is assigned the value 0.
Output State: **`j` is assigned the value 0, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, and `gaps` remain unchanged, `gl` is assigned the value 0**
