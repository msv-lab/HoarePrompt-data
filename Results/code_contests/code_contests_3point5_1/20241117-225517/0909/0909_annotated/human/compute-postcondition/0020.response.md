Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer (incremented by 1 for each successful match), `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the current element in `a`, `ax` is the current element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list. If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns. If `j` reaches `m` or if `ax` does not match the element in list `b` at index `j`, the loop stops. If the loop does not execute, `j` remains 0.***
