According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start, `j` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element in the list `a`.
State: **`j` is 0, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`**
