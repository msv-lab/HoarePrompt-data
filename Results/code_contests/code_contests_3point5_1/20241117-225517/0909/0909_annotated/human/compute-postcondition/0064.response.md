Example Answer:
`special` is assigned the value `False`, and since `special` is `False`, `specialgap` remains 0. The value of `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `special` is False, `specialgap` is 0.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `special` is False, `specialgap` is 0**
