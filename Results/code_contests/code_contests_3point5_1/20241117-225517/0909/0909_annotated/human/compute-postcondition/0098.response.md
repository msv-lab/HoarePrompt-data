Output State: **If `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to the value of `gl`. Otherwise, `specialgap` retains its updated value. The `gaps` list is appended with the value of `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `y * g` for each `g` in `gaps`. The condition `x < y * k` is false.**
