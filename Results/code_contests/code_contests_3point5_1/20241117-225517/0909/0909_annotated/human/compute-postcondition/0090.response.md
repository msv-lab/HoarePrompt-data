Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, and `specialgap` have been updated based on the specified conditions. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to the value of `gl`. In all other cases, the variables retain their updated values from the loop execution. If the loop does not start due to empty input lists or other conditions, the variables maintain their initial values. `gaps` list appends the value of `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. This accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases. `ans` is 0. The condition `x < y * k` is false.***
