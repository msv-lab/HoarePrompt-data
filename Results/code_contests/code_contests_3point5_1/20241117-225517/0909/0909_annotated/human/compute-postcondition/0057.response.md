Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` are variables. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, `gaps` appends `gl`, `gl` is set to 0, `special` is set to False, and `specialgap` takes the value of `gl`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is set to 0, `special` remains False. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True, and `gl` is increased by 1. `i` is increased by 1. In any case, after the if-else block executes, the overall state of the program will be determined based on the conditions met in the if and else parts, ensuring correct assignments and updates to the variables `j`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, and `specialgap` according to the logic specified in the program fragment.***
