Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps` has `gl` appended, `gl` remains unchanged. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. `j` is less than `m`, and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`.**
