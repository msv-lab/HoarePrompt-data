Example Answer:
`specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the initial value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`**
