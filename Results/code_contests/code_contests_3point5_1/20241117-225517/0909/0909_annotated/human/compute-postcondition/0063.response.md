Example Answer: 
`gl` is assigned the value 0. The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` is 0 if `special` is True.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `specialgap` is 0 if `special` is True**
