You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: The input values are as follows:
- n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
- k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- a_i and b_i are integers representing the powers of warriors, such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n.
- a_i are pairwise distinct.
- b_i are pairwise distinct.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *`j` is an integer (incremented by 1 for each successful match), `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the current element in `a`, `ax` is the current element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list. If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns. If `j` reaches `m` or if `ax` does not match the element in list `b` at index `j`, the loop stops. If the loop does not execute, `j` remains 0.

Case_2: *`j` is an integer (incremented by 1 for each successful match), `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the current element in `a`, `ax` is the current element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list, `sb` is a set created from list `b`, `sa` is a set created from list `a`. If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns. If `j` reaches `m` or if `ax` does not match the element in list `b` at index `j`, the loop stops. If the loop does not execute, `j` remains 0. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the program prints 0.

Case_3: *`j`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, and `specialgap` have been updated based on the specified conditions. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to the value of `gl`. In all other cases, the variables retain their updated values from the loop execution. If the loop does not start due to empty input lists or other conditions, the variables maintain their initial values. `gaps` list appends the value of `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns. This accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
