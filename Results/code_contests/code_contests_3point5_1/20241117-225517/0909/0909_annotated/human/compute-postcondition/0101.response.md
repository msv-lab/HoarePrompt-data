The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It operates on internal variables and lists. 

After executing the function body, the function has multiple cases based on different conditions and scenarios:

Case 1: The function increments `j` for each successful match, compares elements in list `a` with elements in list `b`, and stops the loop if conditions are not met. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and returns.

Case 2: Similar to Case 1, but additionally creates sets `sa` and `sb` from lists `a` and `b` respectively. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the function prints 0.

Case 3: Various variables are updated based on conditions, and scenarios are handled. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to a specific value. The function also checks for edge cases and prints -1 and returns if necessary.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` involves working on internal variables and lists to handle different cases and scenarios based on specified conditions and constraints. The function handles comparisons between elements in two lists, incrementing counters, creating sets, and printing specific outputs based on the conditions met.
