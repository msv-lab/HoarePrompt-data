According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `ax`, and `b`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer (increased by 1 if the condition is met), `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]` must be met. Therefore, `j` should be increased by 1, and `ax` should be the next element in list `a`, and `i` should be increased by 1.

State: **`j` is an integer (increased by 1 if the condition is met), `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list**
