Postcondition: *`j` is 0, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `special` remains False. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is True.*
