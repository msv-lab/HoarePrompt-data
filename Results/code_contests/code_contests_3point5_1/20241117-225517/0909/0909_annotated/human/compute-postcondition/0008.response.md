Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list. If `j` is less than `m` and the value of `ax` is equal to the value of `b` at index `j`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.***
