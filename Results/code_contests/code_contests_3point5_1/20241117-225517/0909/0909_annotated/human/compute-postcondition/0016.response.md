Output State: **`j` is an integer (incremented by 1 for each successful match), `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the current element in `a`, `ax` is the current element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list. The loop iterates through list `a` and compares the elements with the elements in list `b`. If there is a match and `j` is less than `m`, `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` reaches `m` or if `ax` does not match the element in list `b` at index `j`, the loop stops. If the loop does not execute, `j` remains 0.**
