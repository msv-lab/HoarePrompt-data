Output State: **`j` is an integer (incremented by 1 for each successful match), `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the current element in `a`, `ax` is the current element in list `a`, `m` is an integer, `b` is a list, `sb` is a set created from list `b`, `sa` is a set created from list `a`. If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns. If `j` reaches `m` or if `ax` does not match the element in list `b` at index `j`, the loop stops. If the loop does not execute, `j` remains 0. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the program prints 0. `mx` is assigned the maximum value in the set difference `sa - sb`.**
