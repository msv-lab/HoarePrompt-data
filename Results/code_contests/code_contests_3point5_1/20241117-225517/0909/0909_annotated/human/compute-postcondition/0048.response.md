Output State: **`j`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `ax`, `b`, `sb`, `sa`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` are variables in the program. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, `gaps` appends `gl`, `gl` is set to 0, `special` is set to False, and `specialgap` takes the value of `gl`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is set to 0, `special` remains False. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True, and `gl` is increased by 1. `i` is increased by 1**
