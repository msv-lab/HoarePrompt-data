Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values and processes them.
2. It iterates through the sequence of powers to check if the resulting sequence can be achieved by transforming the original sequence.
3. It handles cases where it is impossible to transform the sequence by returning -1.
4. It calculates the minimum amount of mana required based on the given conditions and outputs the result.
5. The logic seems to cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
