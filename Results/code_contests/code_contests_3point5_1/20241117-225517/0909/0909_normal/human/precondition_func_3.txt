**Precondition**: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5. x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9. k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n. The sequences a and b have lengths n and m respectively, and all elements in both sequences are pairwise distinct positive integers.
