The function `func_1` processes input data based on comparisons and conditions defined within the code. It involves iterating through lists, comparing elements, calculating gap lengths, and updating variables accordingly. The function prints specific values (-1, 0, or the accumulated sum) based on the outcomes of these operations. The postconditions indicate the states of variables and lists at different stages of execution. Potential edge cases include scenarios where input lists are empty, elements do not match, or special conditions are met. The function handles these cases by adjusting variables and outputting appropriate results.
