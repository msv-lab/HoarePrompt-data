Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `y` and `g`. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so the new value of `ans` becomes `y * g`. The other variables `specialgap`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `specialgap` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the product of `y` and `g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`.
Output State: **`specialgap` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the product of `y` and `g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`**
