Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 0**
