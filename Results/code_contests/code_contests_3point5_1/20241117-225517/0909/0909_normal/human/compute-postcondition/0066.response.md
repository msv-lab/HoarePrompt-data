Postcondition: ***n, m are positive integers within the specified range, a is a non-empty list returned by func_2(), sb is a set containing the elements of b where sa is not equal to sb. If j is less than m and ax is equal to b[j], then j is incremented by 1. If special is True, specialgap is assigned the value of gl. The previous values of gl are appended to gaps. gl is reset to 0 and special is set to False. If j is not less than m or ax is not equal to b[j], then if ax is equal to mx, special is set to True and gl is increased by 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables are in a state where gl is 0, special is False, and if ax is equal to mx, special is set to True and gl is incremented by 1. i is incremented to the next index, ax takes the value of the next element in the list a. If ax is equal to mx, special is True and the rest of the conditions remain unchanged.***
