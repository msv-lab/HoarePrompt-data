Example Answer:
The value of `gl` is appended to the list `gaps`. The previous state of `gl` is 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `i` is incremented to the next index, `ax` takes the value of the next element in the list `a`. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. Otherwise, `specialgap` remains undefined, and `gaps` now contains the value of `gl`.
Output State: **`gl` is 0, `special` is False, `i` is incremented to the next index, `ax` takes the value of the next element in the list `a`, `specialgap` is undefined, gaps now contains the value of `gl`**
