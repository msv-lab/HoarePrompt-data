Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `a`, `sb`, `j`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` remain the same. `gaps` contains the lengths of the gaps between matches of elements from `a` and `b` along with the newly appended length `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns without making any changes to the variables or lists. `ans` is assigned the value 0. `x` is less than `y * k`***
