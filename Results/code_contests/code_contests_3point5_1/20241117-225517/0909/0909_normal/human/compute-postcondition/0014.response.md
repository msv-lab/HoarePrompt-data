Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. `j` is increased by 1 if it is less than `m`. `ax` is equal to `b[j]`. `i` is 2. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. If the condition j < m and ax equals b[j] is satisfied, then j is incremented by 1 while maintaining the initial state of the variables. Otherwise, no changes occur, and the program state remains the same.***
