According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `gaps`. If there are more elements in the `gaps` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated based on the calculations of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`. To execute the loop one more time, the `gaps` list needs to have more elements than it currently has. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculations of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`**
