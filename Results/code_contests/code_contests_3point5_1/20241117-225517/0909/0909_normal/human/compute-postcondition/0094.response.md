Example Answer:
The value of `y * g` is added to `ans`. The previous values of `ans`, `y`, and `g` are known. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will be updated with the sum of the previous `ans` and `y * g`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`specialgap` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the updated product of `y` and `g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`**
