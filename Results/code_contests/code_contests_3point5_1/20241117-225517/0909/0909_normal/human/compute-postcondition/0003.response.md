Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, and `a` is assigned the same value. The specific value returned by `func_2()` is not provided, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, and `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, and `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`**
