Example Answer:
`specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, and `gl` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `specialgap` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`gl` is 0, `special` is False, `i` is incremented to the next index, `ax` takes the value of the next element in the list `a`, `specialgap` is 0**
