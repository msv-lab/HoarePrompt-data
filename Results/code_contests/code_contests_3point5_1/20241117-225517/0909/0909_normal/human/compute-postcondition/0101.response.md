The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It operates on the predefined constraints and relationships described in the Precondition. The function performs various comparisons and operations based on these constraints to determine the final output. The function has three cases with different conditions and outcomes based on the input values and comparisons made during execution.

Case 1: If certain conditions are met during the loop iteration, the function may print -1 and return based on the comparison results. The values of `j`, `i`, and `ax` are determined based on the loop execution and comparisons between elements of `a` and `b`.

Case 2: In this case, the program checks for equality between the sets `sa` and `sb`. If they are equal, the function prints 0 and returns without any changes to the variables.

Case 3: After executing the debug_print function, the state of the variables remains the same. The function calculates the lengths of gaps between matches of elements from `a` and `b` and appends the newly calculated length `gl` to the list of gaps. If a certain condition is met, the function may print -1 and return without altering any variables.

Overall, the functionality of the function `func_1` involves performing comparisons and operations based on the predefined constraints and relationships to determine specific outcomes or print certain values.
Functionality: **The function `func_1` operates on predefined constraints and relationships to perform comparisons and operations, resulting in specific outcomes or printed values based on the input conditions.**
