Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `ans` is an integer representing the accumulated sum. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, `ans` remains 0, and no changes are made to any variables or lists. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k` and `gaps` is empty, `ans` remains 0. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k` and `gaps` contains elements, `ans` is updated based on the calculations of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` for each gap in `gaps` if `x` is less than `y * k`, otherwise `ans` is updated based on the calculation of `y * g` for each gap in `gaps` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`.***
