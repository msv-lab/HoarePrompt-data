Output State: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a` and compares them with the elements of `b`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is incremented based on the comparison results between elements in `a` and `b`. The final values of `j`, `i`, and `ax` depend on the comparison results during the loop execution. If `a` is empty or no elements in `a` match the elements in `b`, `j` remains 0 at the end of the loop. Since the code snippet provided is `print(-1)`, it has no impact on the program variables.
