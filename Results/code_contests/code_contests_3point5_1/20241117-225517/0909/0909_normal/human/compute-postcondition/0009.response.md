According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is increased by 1 if it is less than `m`, and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`. The value of `i` remains 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1 to move to the next element in `a`.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is increased by 1 if it is less than `m`, `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, `i` is 1**
