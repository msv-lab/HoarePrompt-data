According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `i` and the length of list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` is a non-empty list returned by func_2(). `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`. `sa` is not equal to `sb`. After the execution of the if-else block, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True and `gl` is incremented by 1. `i` is incremented to the next index, `ax` takes the value of the next element in the list `a`, `specialgap` is undefined, and `gaps` now contains the value of `gl`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. The previous values of `gl` are appended to `gaps`. `gl` is reset to 0 and `special` is set to False. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True and `gl` is increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented to the next index
- `ax` should take the value of the next element in the list `a`
- `j` should be incremented if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`
- `specialgap` should be assigned the value of `gl` if `special` is True
- `gaps` should contain the updated value of `gl`
- `gl` should be reset to 0
- `special` should be set to False

State: **`n, m` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` is a non-empty list returned by `func_2()`. `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`. `sa` is not equal to `sb`. After the execution of the if-else block, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True and `gl` is incremented by 1. `i` is incremented to the next index, `ax` takes the value of the next element in the list `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. The previous values of `gl` are appended to `gaps`. `gl` is reset to 0 and `special` is set to False. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True and `gl` is increased by 1, `i` should be incremented to the next index, and `ax` should take the value of the next element in the list `a`.**
