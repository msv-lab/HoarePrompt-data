Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the program prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `sb`.***
