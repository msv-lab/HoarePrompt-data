According to the code, the loop can execute again if the index `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is increased by 1 if it is less than `m`, `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, and `i` is 1. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1 to move to the next index in `a`.
- If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` needs to be increased by 1 to move to the next element in the list `b`.

State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. `j` is increased by 1 if it is less than `m`. `ax` is equal to `b[j]`. `i` is 2. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1.**
