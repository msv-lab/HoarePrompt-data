Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` is a non-empty list returned by `func_2()`. `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`. `sa` is not equal to `sb`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. The previous values of `gl` are appended to `gaps`. `gl` is reset to 0 and `special` is set to False. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True and `gl` is increased by 1. `i` is less than the length of `a`. `j` is incremented by 1. In the case where `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. `gaps` now contains the appended values of `gl`.**
