Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block, `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is a non-empty list returned by `func_2()`, `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`, `gaps` contains the lengths of gaps between matches of elements from `a` and `b`, `j` represents the index of the last matching element in `b`, `gl` denotes the length of the current gap, `special` indicates the presence of a special condition, and `specialgap` holds the length of a special gap if `special` is True. Moreover, if `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. This postcondition encapsulates all the possible scenarios and edge cases that can arise during the execution of the if block.***
