Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the calculation `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but after this calculation, `ans` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated based on the calculations of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculations of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)**
