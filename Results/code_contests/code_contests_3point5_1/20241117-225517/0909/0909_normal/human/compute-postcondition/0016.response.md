Output State: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a` and compares them with the elements of `b`. If `j` is less than `m` and the element at index `j` of `b` matches the current element in `a`, then `j` is incremented. The loop continues until either `j` reaches `m` or all elements of `a` have been iterated over. The final values of `j`, `i`, and `ax` depend on the comparison results during the loop execution. If `a` is empty or no elements in `a` match the elements in `b`, `j` remains 0 at the end of the loop.**
