According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` has at least 1 element, and `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in `a`**
