The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `f` which represents a function. The function `f` takes multiple arguments. The function `func_5` returns a list of values calculated by applying `func_5` with arguments from dim[1:] iteratively for dim[0] times, or returns the result of calling `f` if dim is empty. The function `func_5` essentially performs a series of operations using the function `f` based on the arguments provided in dim, and returns the final result as a list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a function f and performs iterative calculations based on the arguments provided in dim, returning the final result as a list. If dim is empty, it returns the result of calling f.**
