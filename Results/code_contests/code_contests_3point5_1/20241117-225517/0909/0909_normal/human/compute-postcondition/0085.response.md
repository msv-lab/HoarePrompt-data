Example Answer:
`ans` is updated based on the calculations of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`, where `x` is less than `y * k`, `gaps` contains at least two elements, and `specialgap` is not less than `k`. The value of `ans` is incremented by `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: `ans` is updated based on the calculations of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculations of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`**
