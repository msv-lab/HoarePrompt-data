Postcondition: ***After executing the debug_print function, the state remains the same. `n`, `m`, `a`, `sb`, `j`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` remain the same, and `gaps` contains the lengths of the gaps between matches of elements from `a` and `b` along with the newly appended length `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns without making any changes to the variables or lists.***
