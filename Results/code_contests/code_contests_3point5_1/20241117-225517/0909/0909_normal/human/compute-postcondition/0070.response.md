Output State: 

- If the list `a` returned by `func_2()` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the variables remain in their initial state.
- If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the program prints 0 and returns, without any changes to the variables.
- After the loop executes:
  - `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the specified range.
  - `a` is a non-empty list returned by `func_2()`.
  - `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`.
  - `gaps` contains the gaps' lengths between matches of elements between `a` and `b`.
  - `j` is the index of the last matching element in `b`.
  - `gl` is the length of the current gap.
  - `special` indicates whether a special condition is met.
  - `specialgap` holds the length of a special gap if `special` is True.

- The loop iterates through the elements of `a` and checks for matches with elements in `b`.
- If a match is found, `gaps` is updated with the length of the gap since the last match, and `j` is incremented.
- If a special condition is met, `specialgap` is assigned the length of the gap, and `special` is set to True.
- If no match is found, and the element in `a` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True, and `gl` is incremented.

- The loop continues until all elements in `a` have been processed.
- The final state after the loop execution depends on the values in `a` and `b`, with `gaps` containing the gaps between matches and the variables `j`, `gl`, `special`, and `specialgap` reflecting the last processed elements and conditions.
