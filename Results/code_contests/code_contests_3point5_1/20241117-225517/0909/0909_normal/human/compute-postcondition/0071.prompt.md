You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is lower than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Output State: 

- If the list `a` returned by `func_2()` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the variables remain in their initial state.
- If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the program prints 0 and returns, without any changes to the variables.
- After the loop executes:
  - `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the specified range.
  - `a` is a non-empty list returned by `func_2()`.
  - `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`.
  - `gaps` contains the gaps' lengths between matches of elements between `a` and `b`.
  - `j` is the index of the last matching element in `b`.
  - `gl` is the length of the current gap.
  - `special` indicates whether a special condition is met.
  - `specialgap` holds the length of a special gap if `special` is True.

- The loop iterates through the elements of `a` and checks for matches with elements in `b`.
- If a match is found, `gaps` is updated with the length of the gap since the last match, and `j` is incremented.
- If a special condition is met, `specialgap` is assigned the length of the gap, and `special` is set to True.
- If no match is found, and the element in `a` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True, and `gl` is incremented.

- The loop continues until all elements in `a` have been processed.
- The final state after the loop execution depends on the values in `a` and `b`, with `gaps` containing the gaps between matches and the variables `j`, `gl`, `special`, and `specialgap` reflecting the last processed elements and conditions.
if condition:
```
if (special):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
