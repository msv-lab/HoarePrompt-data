Example Answer: 
`ans` is incremented by the product of `y` and `g`. The previous value of `ans` is 0, and the conditions state that `specialgap` is less than `k`, `ans` is 0, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`. Therefore, the output state is: `specialgap` is less than `k`, `ans` is the product of `y` and `g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`.
Output State: **`specialgap` is less than `k`, `ans` is the product of `y` and `g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`**
