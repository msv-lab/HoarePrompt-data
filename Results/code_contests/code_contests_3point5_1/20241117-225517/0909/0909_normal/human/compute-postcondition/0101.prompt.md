You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: 
- n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5.
- x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
- k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
- a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n.
- All elements in a_i are pairwise distinct.
- All elements in b_i are pairwise distinct.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *`n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a` and compares them with the elements of `b`. If `j` is less than `m` and the element at index `j` of `b` matches the current element in `a`, then `j` is incremented. The loop continues until either `j` reaches `m` or all elements of `a` have been iterated over. The final values of `j`, `i`, and `ax` depend on the comparison results during the loop execution. If `a` is empty or no elements in `a` match the elements in `b`, `j` remains 0 at the end of the loop. If `j` is less than `m` in the if statement, then the program prints -1 and returns. In this case, the postcondition is that `j` remains less than `m` after the if statement, with no other changes to `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. If `j` is not less than `m`, there are no alterations to the state of the program.

Case_2: *`n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the program prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `sb`.

Case_3: *After executing the debug_print function, the state remains the same. `n`, `m`, `a`, `sb`, `j`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` remain the same, and `gaps` contains the lengths of the gaps between matches of elements from `a` and `b` along with the newly appended length `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns without making any changes to the variables or lists.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
