According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state so that `a` is not empty. Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to have `a` as a non-empty list, `i` as 0, and `ax` as the first element of `a`.
State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` is a non-empty list returned by `func_2()`, `sb` is a set containing the elements of `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`**
