According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition `j < m` and `ax` equals `b[j]` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is increased by 1 if it is less than `m`, `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, and `i` is 2. 

To execute the loop one more time, the condition `j < m` and `ax` equals `b[j]` must be satisfied. This means that `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `ax` must be equal to `b[j]`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` is increased by 1 and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`.
State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. `j` is increased by 1 if it is less than `m`, `ax` is equal to `b[j]`. `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `ax` is equal to `b[j]**
