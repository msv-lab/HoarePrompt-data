Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. 

The code is missing the handling of the case where the input string `s` has an odd length. In such cases, the median letter should be the middle letter of the word, but the code does not account for this. The code incorrectly assumes that the length of the encoded word is always even and therefore does not handle the scenario where the length is odd. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
