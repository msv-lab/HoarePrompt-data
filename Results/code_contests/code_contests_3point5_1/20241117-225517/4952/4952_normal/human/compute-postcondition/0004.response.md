Example Answer:
The character at index (n-2) of the list s is added to the string ns. Since n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, and ns is an empty string, the character at index (n-2) will be added to ns. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-2), i is n-2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-2), i is n-2**
