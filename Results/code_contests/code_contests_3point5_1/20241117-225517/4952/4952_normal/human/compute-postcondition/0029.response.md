Output State: **If n is at least 1, ns contains the characters at indexes (n-4), (n-5), (n-6), (n-7), and the character at index i from string s appended in that order. If n is less than 1, ns remains an empty string. After the execution of the code, i is increased by 2. If n is even, i is n+2. If n is odd, i is n+3.**
