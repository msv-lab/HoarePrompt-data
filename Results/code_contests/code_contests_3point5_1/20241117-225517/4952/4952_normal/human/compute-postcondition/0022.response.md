Example Answer:
The character at index `i` of string `s` is appended to `ns`, and `i` is increased by 2. The previous state of `ns` and `i` is unknown, so after execution, `ns` will contain the characters at indexes (n-4), (n-5), (n-6), and (n-7) from string `s` appended in that order, and `i` will be increased by 2.
Output State: **If n is at least 1, ns contains the characters at indexes (n-4), (n-5), (n-6), and (n-7) from string s appended in that order. If n is less than 1, ns remains an empty string. After the execution of the code, i is increased by 2.**
