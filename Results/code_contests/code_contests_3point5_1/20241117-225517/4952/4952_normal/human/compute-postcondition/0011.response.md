Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decreased by 2, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Since `ns` contains the character at index (n-5) appended with the character at index i, and `i` has changed, the value of `ns` will also change accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5) appended with the character at index (i-2).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5) appended with the character at index (i-2)**
