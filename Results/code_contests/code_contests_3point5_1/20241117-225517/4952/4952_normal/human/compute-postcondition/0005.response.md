Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decreased by 2, and `i` was initially n-2. Since n is a positive integer, and n-2 is the initial value of i, after execution, i will be n-4. The variable ns contains the character at index (n-2), which now will contain the character at index (n-4). Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-4), i is (n-4).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-4), i is (n-4)**
