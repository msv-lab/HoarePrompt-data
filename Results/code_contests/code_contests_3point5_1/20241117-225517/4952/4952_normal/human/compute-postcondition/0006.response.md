According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is (n-4). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to (n-5). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5), i is (n-5)**
