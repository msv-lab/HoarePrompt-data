The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates on the predefined inputs `n` and `s`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. The function processes these inputs internally and returns an output based on the logic implemented within the function.
