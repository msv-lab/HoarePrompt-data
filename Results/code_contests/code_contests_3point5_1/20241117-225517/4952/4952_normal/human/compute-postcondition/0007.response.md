Example Answer:
The character at index (n-5), which is i, is added to the string ns. The value of n is a positive integer, so i is also a positive integer. Therefore, the character at index (n-5) is added to ns. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5), i is (n-5)**
