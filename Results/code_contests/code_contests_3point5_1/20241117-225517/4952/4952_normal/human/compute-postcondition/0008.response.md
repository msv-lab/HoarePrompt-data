Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decreased by 2, where `i` is initially (n-5). Since n is a positive integer, (n-5) is also an integer. So after execution, `i` becomes (n-5)-2 = n-7. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5); i is (n-7).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5); i is (n-7)**
