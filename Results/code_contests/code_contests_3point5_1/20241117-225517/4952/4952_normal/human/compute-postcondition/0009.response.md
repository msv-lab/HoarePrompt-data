According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters, and `ns` contains the character at index (n-5); `i` is (n-7). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5); i is greater than 0**
