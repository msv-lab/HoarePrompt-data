Output State: If n is at least 1, ns contains the characters at indexes (n-4), (n-5), (n-6), (n-7), and the character at index i from string s appended in that order. If n is less than 1, ns remains an empty string. After the execution of the code, i is increased by 2. Adjusted `i` is at least 2 more than its previous value. If n is at least 1, adjusted `n` is at least 1 more than its previous value.
