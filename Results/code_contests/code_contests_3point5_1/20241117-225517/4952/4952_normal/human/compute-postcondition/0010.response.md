Example Answer:
The character at index (n-5) in the list s is appended to the string ns. The previous values of n, s, and ns are known. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5) appended with the character at index i.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of characters, ns contains the character at index (n-5) appended with the character at index i**
