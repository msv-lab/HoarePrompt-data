Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user input. It then constructs a new string `ns` by appending characters from the input string `s` based on specific index calculations. The function handles cases where `n` is at least 1 by appending characters at different indexes in a specific order. If `n` is less than 1, the constructed string `ns` remains empty. The function prints the final constructed string `ns` as the output. **
