Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `n` is a string representing a positive integer. The length of the string is not specified and could be any positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters**
