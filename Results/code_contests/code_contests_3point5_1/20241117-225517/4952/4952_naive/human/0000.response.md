Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first takes the input n which represents the length of the encoded word.
2. Then it takes the input string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
3. It then initializes an empty string ns to store the decoded word.
4. It then starts decoding the word by starting from the second last character of the encoded word and moving backwards in steps of 2, adding each character to the decoded word.
5. If the length of the encoded word is odd, it starts from the first character; if it's even, it starts from the second character and moves forward in steps of 2, adding each character to the decoded word.
6. Finally, it prints the decoded word.
7. The program follows the encoding process described in the problem statement and correctly decodes the word based on the given input. 
8. The logic is sound and accounts for both even and odd length encoded words, thus covering all potential cases.
