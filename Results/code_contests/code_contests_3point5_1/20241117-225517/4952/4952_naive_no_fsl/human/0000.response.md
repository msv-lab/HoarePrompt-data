Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input, reads the encoded word, and decodes it according to the given rules. It iterates through the encoded word, starting from the second to last character (index n-2) and then alternates between adding characters at even and odd indices to the decoded word. This logic follows the problem description accurately. The program correctly decodes the word based on the given encoding process.
