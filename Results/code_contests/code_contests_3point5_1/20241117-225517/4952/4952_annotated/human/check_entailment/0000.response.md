Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly decodes the encoded word as described in the problem. It first reads the input, then iterates through the characters in reverse order based on whether the length of the string is odd or even to extract the characters in the correct order. Finally, it prints the decoded word. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles both odd and even length strings.
