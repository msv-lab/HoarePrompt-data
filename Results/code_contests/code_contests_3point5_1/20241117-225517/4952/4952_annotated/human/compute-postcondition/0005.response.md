Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 2, but the previous value of `i` is determined by `n - 2`. Hence, the new value of `i` is calculated based on the initial value of `n`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string with the character at index `i`, and `i` is determined by the new value of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string with the character at index `i`, and `i` is determined by the new value of `n`**
