According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string with the character at index `i`, `i` is greater than 0**
