Example Answer:
The character at index `i` from list `s` is appended to the string `ns`. The value of `i` depends on the new value of `n`, which is an input integer. The resulting output state will have the updated string `ns`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string with the character at index `i`**
