Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. Since the precondition states that `n` is a positive integer, we need to convert the input string to an integer. The string `s` is not affected by this code. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters**
