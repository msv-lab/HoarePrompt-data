Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so the final value of `i` cannot be determined. The states of `n`, `s`, and `ns` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string with the character at index `i`**
