Example Answer:
The variable `ns` is assigned an empty string. Since the values of `n` and `s` are not used in the assignment, they remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is an empty string**
