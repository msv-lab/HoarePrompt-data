Functionality: **The function reads an input integer `n` and a string `s`, then constructs a new string `ns` by appending characters from `s` based on the indices calculated by `n`. If `n` is greater or equal to 2, `ns` includes characters at indices `i` starting from `n - 2` and then at even indices from 0 up to `n`. If `n` is 1 or lower, `ns` remains empty. The function outputs the final string `ns`.**
