Example Answer: 
If `n` is greater or equal to 2, `ns` will concatenate the characters at indices `i`, where `i` is determined by the new value of `n`. `i` is then increased by 2 until it is less than `n`. If `n` is 1 or lower, `ns` remains an empty string. 
Output State: **If `n` is greater or equal to 2, `ns` will contain the characters at specific indices based on the new value of `n` and `i` will be increased by 2 until it is less than `n`. If `n` is 1 or lower, `ns` remains an empty string.**
