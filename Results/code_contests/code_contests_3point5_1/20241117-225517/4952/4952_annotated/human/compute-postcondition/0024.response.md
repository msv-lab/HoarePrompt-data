According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is increased by 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is increased by 4**
