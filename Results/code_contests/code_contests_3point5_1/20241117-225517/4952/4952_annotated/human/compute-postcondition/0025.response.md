Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is used to access the character at index `i` in the string `s`, which is then concatenated to the string `ns`. Since the initial state does not provide the values of `ns` or `s`, the output state after running the code cannot be determined without additional information.
Output State: **Cannot be determined without additional information**
