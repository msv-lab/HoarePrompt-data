Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the value `n - 2`, where `n` is an input integer. The value of `i` depends on the input value of `n`. The other variables `s` and `ns` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is an empty string, `i` is determined by `n - 2`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is an empty string, `i` is determined by `n - 2`**
