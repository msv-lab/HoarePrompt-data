According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` is increased by 2. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `n` should also be increased by at least 2.
State: **The value of `i` is increased by 2, the value of `n` is increased by at least 2**
