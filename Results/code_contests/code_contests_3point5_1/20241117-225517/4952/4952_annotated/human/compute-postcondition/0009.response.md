According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is determined by the new value of `n` and is greater than 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string with the character at index `i`, and `i` is determined by the new value of `n` and is greater than or equal to 0**
