Output State: **If n is greater or equal to 2, then `ns` is a string with the characters at even indices, determined by the new value of `n`. If `n` is 1 or lower, `ns` remains an empty string. In the if part, if `n` is odd, then `i` is set to 0, and in the else part, if `n` is even, `i` is set to 1. `i` is increased by 2 after each iteration.**
