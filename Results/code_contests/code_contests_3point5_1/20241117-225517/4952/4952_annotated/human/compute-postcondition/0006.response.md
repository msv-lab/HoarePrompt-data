According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` will be determined by the new value of `n`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `ns` is a string with the character at index `i`, and `i` is determined by the new value of `n` and `i` is greater than 0**
