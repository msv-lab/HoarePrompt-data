Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet. The program maintains a frequency dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each number in the row. It then iterates through the row, decrementing the frequency of each number and updating the remaining count of distinct numbers. For each number encountered, it calculates the number of possible pairs that can be formed without the robots meeting. Finally, it prints the total count of such pairs, which is the correct output as per the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and works correctly for all inputs.
