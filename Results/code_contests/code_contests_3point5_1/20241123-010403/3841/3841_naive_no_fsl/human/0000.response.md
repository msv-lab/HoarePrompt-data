Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input as described in the problem statement.
2. It then calculates the frequency of each number in the array and keeps track of visited numbers.
3. It iterates through the array and updates the frequency count, then checks if the number has been visited before.
4. It updates the remaining count of unique numbers and adds the remaining count to the answer if the number has not been visited before.
5. Finally, it prints the answer which represents the number of pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet.
6. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all possible cases, hence the correctness of the program.
