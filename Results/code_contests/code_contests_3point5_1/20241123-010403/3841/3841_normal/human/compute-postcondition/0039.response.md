Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the updated frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr` decreased by 1 if the frequency of `i` is zero, and `ans` is updated based on the loop execution. If `vis[i]` is false, `ans` is increased by `rem`, and `vis[i]` is set to 1. The state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block covers all possible edge cases and updates the necessary variables accordingly.***
