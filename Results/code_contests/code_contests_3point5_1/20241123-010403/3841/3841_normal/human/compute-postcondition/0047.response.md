According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are still elements in the list `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the updated frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr` decreased by 1 if the frequency of `i` is zero, and `ans` is updated based on the loop execution with the next element `i` selected from `arr`.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the next element `i` needs to be selected from `arr`. This means that the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `rem` should be decremented by 1 if the frequency of the next element `i` is zero.
- `ans` should be incremented by the value of `rem` if the visibility of the next element `i` is false.
- The visibility of the next element `i` should be set to 1 in the `vis` dictionary.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the updated frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr` decreased by 1 if the frequency of the next element `i` is zero, and `ans` is updated based on the loop execution with the next element `i` selected from `arr`. If the frequency of the next element `i` is zero, `rem` is decremented by 1. After the if statement, `ans` is incremented by the value of `rem` if the visibility of the next element `i` is false. The visibility of the next element `i` is set to 1 in the `vis` dictionary.**
