Example Answer:
The code snippet reads a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each of them to integers, and stores them in a list `arr`. The variable `n` is used to input the integers. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers**
