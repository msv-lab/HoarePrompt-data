Example Answer: 
The code snippet updates the frequency of the value `i` in the dictionary `freq`. If `i` is not already a key in the dictionary, its frequency is set to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are not impacted by this code snippet, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequency values, `vis` is a dictionary with updated values, and the loop will process the next element in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequency values, `vis` is a dictionary with updated values, and the loop will process the next element in `arr`**
