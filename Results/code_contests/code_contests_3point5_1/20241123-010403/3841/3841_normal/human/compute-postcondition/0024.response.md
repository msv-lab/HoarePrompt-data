According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `arr`. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `i` is the first element in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, `ans` is 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
