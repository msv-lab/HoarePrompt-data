According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `arr` has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, `n` being an input integer doesn't affect the loop execution. The empty dictionary `freq` and `vis` being empty also don't impact the loop. So, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `i` during the first iteration should be the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
