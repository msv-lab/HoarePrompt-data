Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequency values based on the calculation of `freq.get(i, 0)`, `vis` is a dictionary with updated values. If the frequency of element `i` in `freq` is 0, then `vis[i]` is set to 0. All other elements in `vis` remain unchanged.***
