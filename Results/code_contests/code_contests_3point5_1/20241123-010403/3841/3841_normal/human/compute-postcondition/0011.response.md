Example Answer: 
`freq[i]` is updated with the value `freq.get(i, 0)`, which means if `i` is already a key in `freq`, its value remains the same, otherwise, it is set to 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequency values based on the calculation of `freq.get(i, 0)`, `vis` is a dictionary with updated values, and `i` is the next element in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated frequency values based on the calculation of `freq.get(i, 0)`, `vis` is a dictionary with updated values, and `i` is the next element in `arr`**
