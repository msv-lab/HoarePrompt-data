Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, `ans` is 0, and `i` is the first element in `arr` where `freq[i]` has been decremented by 1. If the frequency of element `i` becomes 0 after execution, `rem` is decreased by 1, `ans` is set to 0, and the frequency of element `i` is updated to 0. The visibility of element `i` in `vis` is now true due to the condition being not true.***
