Example Answer:
The code sets the value of `freq[i]` to either the current value of `freq[i]` if it exists, or 0 if it does not. Since `i` is the first element of `arr`, the value of `freq[i]` will be set to 0 if it does not already exist. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` as key and 0 as value, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` as key and 0 as value, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
