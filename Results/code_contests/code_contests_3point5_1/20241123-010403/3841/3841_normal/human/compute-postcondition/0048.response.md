Output State: 
- If `arr` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and the values of all variables will remain the same as the initial state.
- If `arr` is a non-empty list, the loop iterates through each element `i` in `arr`. For each iteration, the frequency of `i` in `freq` is decreased by 1. If the frequency becomes 0, `rem` is decremented by 1. If `vis[i]` is False, `ans` is increased by the current value of `rem`, and `vis[i]` is set to 1. 
- The loop continues until all elements in `arr` have been processed.
- After the loop executes, the final state includes the updated values of `freq`, `vis`, `rem`, and `ans` based on the logic inside the loop.

Output State: **After the loop execution, the values of variables are updated as per the loop logic: `freq` contains the updated frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` stores the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` represents the number of unique elements in `arr`, and `ans` is the sum of `rem` values in each iteration where `vis[i]` is False. The loop handles all edge cases, including the scenario where the loop does not execute if `arr` is empty.**
