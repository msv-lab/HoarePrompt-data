Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`. If an element `i` in `arr` has a frequency of 0 in `freq`, then `vis[i]` is set to 0. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `freq` and `vis` remain empty dictionaries, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`**.
