Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, `ans` is increased by the value of `rem` if `vis[i]` is False. After the execution, `vis[i]` is updated to 1. The overall state of the program maintains the initial conditions while accurately reflecting the changes caused by the if statement, ensuring that the frequency of `i` is decremented by 1 and if it becomes 0, `rem` is decreased by 1, `ans` is set to 0, and the frequency of `i` is updated to 0.***
