Example Answer: 
`vis` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `vis` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
