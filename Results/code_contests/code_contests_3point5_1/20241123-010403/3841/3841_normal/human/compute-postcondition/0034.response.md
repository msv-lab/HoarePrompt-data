Example Answer:
The frequency of the element `i` in the `freq` dictionary is decremented by 1. The previous value of the frequency of `i` is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary containing the updated frequency of each element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary containing the visibility of elements in `arr`, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, and the frequency of `i` is correctly decremented or updated based on the loop body execution.
