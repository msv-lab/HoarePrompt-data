The function reads an integer `n` as input and a list of integers `arr`. It then processes the elements in `arr` to calculate the sum `ans` based on certain conditions. The function updates dictionaries `freq` and `vis` to keep track of the frequency and visibility of elements in `arr`. Finally, it prints the calculated sum `ans`. The function handles cases where `arr` is empty by not executing the loop.
