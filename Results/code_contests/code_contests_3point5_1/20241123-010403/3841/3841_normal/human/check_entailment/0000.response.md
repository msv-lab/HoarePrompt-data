Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input, processes the elements in `arr`, calculates the sum `ans` based on the conditions specified in the problem description, and prints the final result.
- The code updates dictionaries `freq` and `vis` to keep track of the frequency and visibility of elements in `arr`.
- The code handles cases where `arr` is empty by not executing the loop.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it accurately counts the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet.
