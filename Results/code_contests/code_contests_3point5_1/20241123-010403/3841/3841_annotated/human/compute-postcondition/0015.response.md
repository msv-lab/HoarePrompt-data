Since the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `arr`, we need to adjust the states accordingly. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0, and `vis` is a dictionary after processing the current element in `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to make sure that there is at least one more element in the list `arr` to iterate over. So, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the current element in `arr`**
