Example Answer:
The code snippet checks if the key `i` exists in the dictionary `freq`. If it does, it returns the value associated with the key `i`, otherwise, it returns 0. After execution, the value of `freq[i]` is updated accordingly. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the current element in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the current element in `arr`**
