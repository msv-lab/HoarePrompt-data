Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the current element in `arr`. If the value of `freq[i]` is 0, then `vis[i]` is set to 0. If the value of `freq[i]` is not 0, then no changes are made to `vis[i]`.***
