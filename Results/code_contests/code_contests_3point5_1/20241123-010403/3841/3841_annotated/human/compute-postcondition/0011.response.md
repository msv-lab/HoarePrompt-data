Example Answer:
`freq[i]` is assigned the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`, which means if `i` is already a key in `freq`, its value is increased by 1, otherwise it is assigned 0. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the current element in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the current element in `arr`**
