Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key and 0 otherwise, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the first element in `arr`, `i` is the first element in `arr`, and the value of `i` in `freq` is 0 (since `not freq[i]` is true)***
