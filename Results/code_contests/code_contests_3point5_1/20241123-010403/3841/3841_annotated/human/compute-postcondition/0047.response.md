According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `arr` array and the status of `vis[i]`. If there are more elements in the `arr` array to be processed and the element `i` has not been visited before, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed, `rem` and `ans` are integers, and the status of `vis[i]` is updated based on the previous element.

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in the `arr` array needs to be processed, and the corresponding `rem`, `ans`, and `vis` values need to be updated based on the properties of that element.
State: **`arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed, updated `rem`, `ans`, and `vis` values based on the next element in the array**
