Output State: **`arr` is non-empty, `i` is incremented in `freq` each time `i` is encountered, initialized to 0 if not in `freq` yet, `vis` is updated based on `freq[i]` where if it is 0 then `vis[i]` is set to 0, `rem` is assigned the length of the set of elements in `arr` minus 1, `ans` is 0, `freq[i]` is decremented by 1.**
