According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `arr` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, the dictionaries `freq` and `vis` are empty, so they need to be adjusted to reflect the state after the loop executes for the first element in `arr`. Additionally, since the loop iterates over elements in `arr`, the variable `i` should be the first element in `arr`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary after processing the first element in `arr`, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the first element in `arr`, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
