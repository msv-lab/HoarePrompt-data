Output State: **If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute. In this case, `n` remains the input integer, `freq` and `vis` remain empty dictionaries. If `arr` is a non-empty list, the loop increments the value of `i` in `freq` each time `i` is encountered in `arr`. If `i` is not in `freq` yet, it initializes it to 0. `vis` is updated based on the value of `freq[i]`, if it is 0 then `vis[i]` is set to 0.**
