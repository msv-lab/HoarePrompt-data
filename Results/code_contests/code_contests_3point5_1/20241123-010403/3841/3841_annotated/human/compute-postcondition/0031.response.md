Output State: **`arr` is non-empty, `i` is incremented in `freq` each time `i` is encountered, initialized to 0 if not in `freq` yet. If `arr` is non-empty, `vis` is updated based on `freq[i]` where if it is 0 then `vis[i]` is set to 0. If `arr` is non-empty, `rem` is assigned the length of the set of elements in `arr` minus 1. `ans` is updated by adding `rem`. `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. If not freq[i], then `rem` is decreased by 1. If `vis[i]` is not true, then the state of the program is as described above. `vis[i]` is set to 1**
