At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- The list `arr` should still have elements left to iterate through.
- The dictionary `freq` should be updated based on the current iteration `i`.
- The dictionary `vis` should be updated based on the current iteration `i`.
- If the value of `i` in `freq` is 0, then `vis[i]` should be set to 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the current element in `arr`.**
