Example Answer:
The value of `vis[i]` is set to 1. The variables `arr` and `rem` are not affected by this operation. The value of `ans` is incremented by the current value of `rem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed, `rem` is decreased by 1 if the frequency of element `i` in `arr` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by the previous value of `rem`.
Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed, `rem` is decreased by 1 if the frequency of element `i` in `arr` is 0, `ans` is incremented by the previous value of `rem`**
