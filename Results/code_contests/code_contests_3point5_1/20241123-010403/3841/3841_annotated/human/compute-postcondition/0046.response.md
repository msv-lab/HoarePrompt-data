Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed, `rem` and `ans` are integers. If the element `i` has not been visited before (`vis[i]` is false), `rem` is decreased by 1 if the frequency of element `i` in `arr` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by the previous value of `rem`. Additionally, `vis[i]` is set to 1. If `vis[i]` is true, there are no changes to `rem`, `ans`, or `vis`.***
