Example Answer:
The value of `rem` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `rem` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed, `rem` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed, `rem` is decreased by 1**
