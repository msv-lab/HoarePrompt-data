Postcondition: ***If `arr` is non-empty, after the execution of the if statement, `i` is incremented in `freq` each time `i` is encountered, initialized to 0 if not in `freq` yet. `vis` is updated based on `freq[i]`, where if it is 0 then `vis[i]` is set to 0. `rem` is assigned the length of the set of elements in `arr` minus 1. `ans` is updated by adding `rem`. `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. If `freq[i]` does not exist, then `rem` is decreased by 1. If `vis[i]` is not true, `ans` is increased by `rem`, and `vis[i]` is set to 1. This accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the proper update of the program variables based on the conditions.***
