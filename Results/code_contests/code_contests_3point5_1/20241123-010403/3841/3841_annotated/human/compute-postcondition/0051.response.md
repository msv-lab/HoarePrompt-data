Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then processes the list to count the frequency of each element and track visited elements. After processing, it calculates and prints the final answer. The function handles cases where the input list is empty, and it does not explicitly return any value.**
