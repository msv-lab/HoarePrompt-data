Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key increased by 1, otherwise 0. `vis` is a dictionary after processing the first element in `arr`. If the value of `i` in `freq` is 0, then `vis[i]` is set to 0.**
