Output State: **If `arr` is a non-empty array, after the loop execution, `freq` will contain the count of each element in `arr`, `vis` will track if an element has been visited, `rem` will be the count of unique elements in `arr`, and `ans` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop. If `arr` is empty, `n` remains the same, `freq` and `vis` are empty dictionaries, `rem` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**
