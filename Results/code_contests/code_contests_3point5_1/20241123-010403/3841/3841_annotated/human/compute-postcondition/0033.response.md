According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `arr` list. If there are still elements left to iterate through, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- Update `i` to the next element in `arr`
- Update `freq[i]` based on the conditions mentioned
- Update `vis[i]` based on the conditions mentioned
- Update `rem` based on the length of the set of elements in `arr` minus 1
- Update `ans` based on the conditions mentioned

State: **If `arr` is non-empty, after the execution of the if statement, the program variables `i`, `freq`, `vis`, `rem`, and `ans` need to be adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.**
