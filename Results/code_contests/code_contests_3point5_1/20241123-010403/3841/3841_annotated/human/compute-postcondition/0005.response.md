Example Answer:
The code sets the value of `freq[i]` to the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`, which means if `i` is already a key in the dictionary `freq`, it will keep its value, otherwise, it will default to 0. Since `i` is the first element in `arr`, after processing the first element, `freq[i]` will either have the value of `i` if it was already in `freq`, or it will be set to 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the first element in `arr`, `i` is the first element in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `i` if `i` was already a key, otherwise 0, `vis` is a dictionary after processing the first element in `arr`, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
