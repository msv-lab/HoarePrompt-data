Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `rem`. The previous values of `ans` and `rem` are unknown, so the output state is: `arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed. If the frequency of element `i` in `arr` is 0, then `rem` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to `rem` or `arr`. `ans` is incremented by `rem`.
Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed. If the frequency of element `i` in `arr` is 0, then `rem` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to `rem` or `arr`. `ans` is incremented by `rem`**
