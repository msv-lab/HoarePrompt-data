Example Answer:
The dictionary `freq` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `freq` is an empty dictionary**
