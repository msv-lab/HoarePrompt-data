Example Answer:
The code takes an input of integers separated by spaces and converts them into a list of integers assigned to the variable `arr`. Since the initial state only mentions `n` as an input integer, the state of `n` remains the same. The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers**
