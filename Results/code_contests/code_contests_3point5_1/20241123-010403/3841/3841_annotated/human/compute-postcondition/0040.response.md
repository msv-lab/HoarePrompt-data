According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the non-empty array `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a non-empty array. If `freq[i]` is false, `rem` is decreased by 1. After the execution of the if statement, `i` retains its original value, `freq` retains its original values, `vis[i]` is set to 1 if `vis[i]` was false, and `ans` is increased by the value of `rem` if `vis[i]` was false. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the array `arr` must be considered. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`arr` is a non-empty array with the next element to be processed**
