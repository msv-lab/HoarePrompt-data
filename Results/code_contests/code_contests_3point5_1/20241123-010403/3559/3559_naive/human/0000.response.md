Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not generate a table where the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is also a square. The program simply generates numbers based on the given input without considering the condition mentioned in the problem description. 

For example, if we input 2 2, the output should be such that the sum of squares of each row and column is also a square. However, the program outputs:
```
9 1
12 1
```
Which does not satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem description.
