Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to generate a table where the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is also a square. The code only provides specific cases based on the value of `x`, but it does not cover all possible scenarios. For instance, when `n` and `m` are both odd, the code does not handle this case correctly. Additionally, the code does not ensure that each number in the table does not exceed 10^8, which is a requirement in the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
