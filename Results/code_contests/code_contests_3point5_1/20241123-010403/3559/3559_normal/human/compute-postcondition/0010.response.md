Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100 and x is not equal to 1. If x % 2 == 1, the program returns a list of size x where the first element is x / 2 + 1, the second element is 2, and the rest of the elements are all 1. If x % 2 != 1, the program returns a list containing x / 2 - 1 elements of value 1 followed by x - 1 elements of value 1.***
