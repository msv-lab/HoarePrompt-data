Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If x == 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1. If x == 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If x is odd, the function returns a list of size x where the first element is (x / 2) + 1, the second element is 2, and the remaining elements are all 1. If x is even, the function returns a list containing (x / 2) - 1 elements of value 1 followed by x - 1 elements of value 1. The postcondition encompasses all possible scenarios and captures the behavior of the function based on the value of x.***
