Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` within the range of 1 to 100. Depending on the value of `x`, the function returns different lists:
- If `x` is equal to 1, it returns a list containing the integer 1.
- If `x` is equal to 2, it returns the list [3, 4].
- If `x` is odd, it returns a list where the first element is calculated as (x / 2) + 1, the second element is 2, and the rest of the elements are all 1.
- If `x` is even, it returns a list with (x / 2) - 1 elements of value 1 followed by x - 1 elements of value 1.
The function's functionality covers various scenarios based on the value of `x` as described in the code.**
