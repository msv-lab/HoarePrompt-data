The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. The constraints on `x` are that it is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 100. After executing the function body, the function returns different lists based on the value of `x`:
- If x is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1.
- If x is equal to 2, the function returns the list [3, 4].
- If x is odd, the function returns a list of size x where the first element is (x / 2) + 1, the second element is 2, and the remaining elements are all 1.
- If x is even, the function returns a list containing (x / 2) - 1 elements of value 1 followed by x - 1 elements of value 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `x` within the range of 1 to 100 and return different lists based on the value of `x` as described above.
