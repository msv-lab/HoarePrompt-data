Correctness: True

The program correctly generates a table of size n x m where the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is a square. The logic in the function `func_1` covers all possible cases based on the value of x (1, 2, odd, even) and returns the expected output for each case. The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and can handle all possible inputs within the given constraints.
