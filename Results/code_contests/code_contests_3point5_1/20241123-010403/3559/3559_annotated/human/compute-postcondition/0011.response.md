Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. x is not equal to 1. If x == 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If x % 2 == 1, the function returns a list with elements [x / 2 + 1, 2, 1, 1, ..., 1] where the number of '1's in the list is (x - 2). If x % 2 != 1, the function returns a list containing x/2 - 1 times the number 1 followed by x - 1 number of 1s.***
