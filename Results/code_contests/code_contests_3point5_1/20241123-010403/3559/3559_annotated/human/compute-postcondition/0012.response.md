Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The program returns [1] if x is 1. If x is 2, the function returns [3, 4]. If x is an odd number, the function returns a list starting with x / 2 + 1 and then 2, followed by (x - 2) number of 1s. If x is an even number, the function returns a list with x/2 - 1 times the number 1 followed by x - 1 number of 1s.***
