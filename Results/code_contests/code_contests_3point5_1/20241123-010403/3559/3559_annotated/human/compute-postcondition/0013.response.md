The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter constraints are that `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 100. After executing the function body, the program returns [1] if x is 1. If x is 2, the function returns [3, 4]. If x is an odd number, the function returns a list starting with x / 2 + 1 and then 2, followed by (x - 2) number of 1s. If x is an even number, the function returns a list with x/2 - 1 times the number 1 followed by x - 1 number of 1s. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `x` and return a list based on the conditions described above. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer x and returns a list based on the specified conditions.**
