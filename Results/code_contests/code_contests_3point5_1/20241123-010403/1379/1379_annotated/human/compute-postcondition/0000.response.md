Example Answer:
The value `v` is passed to `func_2`, and the result is used as an index to access `par` list. The value at index `func_2(v)` is then assigned the value returned by `func_2(u)`. The previous values of `par` and the variables `u` and `v` are unknown, so the output state is: n is a positive integer, and each circle is described by three integers x, y, and r where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values simultaneously.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, and each circle is described by three integers x, y, and r where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values simultaneously.**
