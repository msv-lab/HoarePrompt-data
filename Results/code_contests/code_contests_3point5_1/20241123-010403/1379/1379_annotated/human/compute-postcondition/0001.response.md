The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `v` and `u`. Parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of circles, and each circle is described by three integers `x`, `y`, and `r` where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values simultaneously. The function does not return any value explicitly, it performs a certain operation or calculations based on the input parameters `v` and `u`.
