The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, A and B. Parameter A is a positive integer representing the number of circles, while parameter B is a tuple representing a circle with three integers x, y, and r. The function calculates a vector d as the rotation of (A - B) and then returns a line passing through the circle's center at coordinates (x, y) with a length of r times A. The code does not handle potential errors like division by zero or invalid inputs for circle coordinates and radius.
