The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `n` and a list `v` of circle coordinates and radii. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Each circle is described by three integers x, y, and r, where -10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it processes the input circles according to the constraints provided.
