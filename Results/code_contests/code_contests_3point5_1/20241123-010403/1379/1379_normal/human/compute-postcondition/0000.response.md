Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with input `v`, and its return value is used as the key to assign the value of `func_2(u)` in the dictionary `par`. The previous values of `u` and `v` are unknown, so the exact impact on the dictionary cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and the dictionary `par` may have been updated based on the return values of `func_2`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and the dictionary `par` may have been updated based on the return values of `func_2`**
