Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program defines a function that calculates the number zn based on a predefined list 'a' and the input number n. The list 'a' contains precomputed values that are used to calculate the result efficiently. The program correctly calculates the number zn as per the problem description by raising 2 to the power of a[n] and then performing the necessary modulo operations. The program follows the problem description for all possible inputs and provides the correct output.
