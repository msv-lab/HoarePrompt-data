Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input `n`, calculates a value based on the elements of list `a`, and prints the result. The calculation involves exponentiation and modulo operations. However, there is a syntax error in the code where the modulo operation should be performed within parentheses. The function is expected to handle cases where `n` is a positive integer from 1 to 40, but there is a missing validation for ensuring the input `n` falls within this range.**
