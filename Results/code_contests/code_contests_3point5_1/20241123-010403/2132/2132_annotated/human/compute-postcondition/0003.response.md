The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return a value based on the preconditions provided. Since no parameters are accepted, the function should calculate or generate the output based on the constraints given. The output of the function should be determined by the functionality defined within the function body, which is influenced by the precondition that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40.
