Functionality: **The function `func` initializes a list `a` with a sequence of prime numbers. It then takes an input `n`, calculates a value using the `pow` function, and prints the result after performing some arithmetic operations. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, based on the code, it seems to be performing modular arithmetic and printing the result. It has a precondition that `n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 40. The functionality of the function is to process the input `n` and output the result of the arithmetic operations.**
