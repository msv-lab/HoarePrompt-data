Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input `n` is 40. In this case, the code will result in an error due to the use of the `input()` function without any type conversion. The code is also supposed to print the result after performing some arithmetic operations, but it actually performs division and modulus operations that are not mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
