Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the problem description. It uses the pre-calculated list 'a' which contains values that help in finding the number zn for a given n. The program then calculates the result using the formula provided in the problem description. The modulo operation ensures that the output is within the defined constraints. Since the program follows the problem description for all possible inputs within the given constraints, it is considered correct.
