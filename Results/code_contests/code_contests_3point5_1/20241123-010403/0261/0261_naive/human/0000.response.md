Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly takes the input of four integers representing the number of candies in each bag, sorts them, and checks if it's possible to distribute the bags to Dawid's friends so that both friends receive the same amount of candies. It correctly compares the sums of candies in different combinations of bags and outputs 'YES' if it's possible and 'NO' otherwise. The logic is sound and covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
