Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if it is possible to distribute the bags in such a way that both friends receive the same amount of candies. It sorts the input data and then checks if the sum of the smallest and largest numbers is equal to the sum of the two middle numbers, or if the sum of the three smallest numbers is equal to the largest number. This logic covers all possible ways to distribute the bags to achieve the desired outcome.
