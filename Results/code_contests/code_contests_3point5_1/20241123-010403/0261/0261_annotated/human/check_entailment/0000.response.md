Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. It only checks if it's possible to distribute the bags by comparing the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted list with the sum of the middle elements. However, this logic is not correct for all cases. 

For example, consider the input:
7 5 5 2

The correct output should be "YES" because Dawid can give the first and second bags to the first friend, and the third and fourth bags to the second friend. Both friends will receive 12 candies each. 

But the program will output "NO" for this input because it only checks the sums of the first and last elements with the middle elements, which doesn't cover all possible distributions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
