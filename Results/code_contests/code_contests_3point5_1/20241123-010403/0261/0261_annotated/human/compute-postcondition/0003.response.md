Example Answer:
The `data` list is sorted in ascending order. The initial values of `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4`, and `data` is a list of integers after conversion and sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4`, and `data` is a list of integers after conversion and sorted in ascending order**
