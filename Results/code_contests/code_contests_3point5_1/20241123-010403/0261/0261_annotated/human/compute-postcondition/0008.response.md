Postcondition: ***`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and `data` is a list of integers after conversion and sorted in ascending order. If the condition `(data[0] + data[3] == data[1] + data[2] or data[0] + data[1] + data[2] == data[3])` is true, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. This covers all cases where the sum of the first and last elements of `data` is equal to the sum of the middle elements, or where the sum of the first three elements of `data` is equal to the last element.***
