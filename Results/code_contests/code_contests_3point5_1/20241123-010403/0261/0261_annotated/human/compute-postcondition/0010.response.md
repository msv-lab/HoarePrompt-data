Functionality: **The function `func` reads a line of input, splits it into integers, sorts them in ascending order, and then checks if the sum of the first and last elements is equal to the sum of the middle elements, or if the sum of the first three elements is equal to the last element. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
