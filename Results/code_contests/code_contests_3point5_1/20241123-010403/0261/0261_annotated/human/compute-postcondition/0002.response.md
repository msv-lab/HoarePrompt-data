Example Answer:
Each element in the list `data` is converted to an integer from the original `alphabet` list. The initial state provided does not contain the actual values of `data` or `alphabet`, so we cannot provide the specific output state for `data` after the conversion. Therefore, the output state is: `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4`, and `data` is a list of integers after conversion.
Output State: **`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4`, and `data` is a list of integers after conversion**
