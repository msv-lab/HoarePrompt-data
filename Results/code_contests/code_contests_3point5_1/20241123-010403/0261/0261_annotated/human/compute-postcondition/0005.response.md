Output State: **`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `a_i` â‰¤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and `data` is a list of integers after conversion and sorted in ascending order. The condition `(data[0] + data[3] == data[1] + data[2] or data[0] + data[1] + data[2] == data[3])` is satisfied. 'YES' is printed**
