Example Answer:
The `data` variable is assigned the result of splitting the `alphabet` string. Since no specific values are given for `alphabet`, the output state will be: `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4`, and `data` contains the elements extracted from splitting `alphabet`.
Output State: **`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4`, `data` contains the elements extracted from splitting `alphabet`**
