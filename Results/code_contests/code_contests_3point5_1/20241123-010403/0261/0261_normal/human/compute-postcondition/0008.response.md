Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100. If the sum of the first and last elements of `data` is equal to the sum of the middle two elements of `data`, or if the sum of the first three elements of `data` is equal to the last element of `data`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. In all cases, `data` contains these sorted integers and the conditions cover all possible combinations of the values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` within the specified range.***
