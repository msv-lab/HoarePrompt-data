Example Answer: 
The variable `data` is assigned the result of splitting the string `alphabet`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `alphabet`, so we cannot determine the exact values in `data`. Therefore, the output state is: a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Output State: **a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4**
