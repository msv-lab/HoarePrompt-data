Example Answer:
Each element in the list `data` is converted to an integer using list comprehension. The initial values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100. After execution, the values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are converted to integers and stored in the list `data`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100 and `data` contains these converted integers.
Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100 and `data` contains these converted integers**
