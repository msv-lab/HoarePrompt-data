Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect any variables in the initial state. Since the snippet always prints 'YES', regardless of the initial state of the variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100. The sum of the first and last elements of `data` is equal to the sum of the middle two elements of `data`, or the sum of the first three elements of `data` is equal to the last element of `data`. `data` contains these sorted integers.**
