Example Answer:
The `data` list containing integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` is sorted in ascending order. Since the initial states of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100, after sorting, the `data` list will be sorted in ascending order. 
Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100 and `data` contains these sorted integers**.
