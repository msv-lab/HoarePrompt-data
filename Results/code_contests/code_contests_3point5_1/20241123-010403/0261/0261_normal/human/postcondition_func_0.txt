The function `func` reads input from the user, splits it into integers, sorts the integers, and then checks if specific conditions are met based on the sorted integers. If the sum of the first and last elements of `data` is equal to the sum of the middle two elements of `data`, or if the sum of the first three elements of `data` is equal to the last element of `data`, then it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
