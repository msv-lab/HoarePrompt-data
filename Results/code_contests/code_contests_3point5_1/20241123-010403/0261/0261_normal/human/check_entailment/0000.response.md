Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes the input, splits it into integers, sorts the integers, and then checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted list is equal to the sum of the middle two elements, or if the sum of the first three elements is equal to the last element. This logic follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code is correctly implementing the required conditions for distributing the candies to Dawid's friends.
