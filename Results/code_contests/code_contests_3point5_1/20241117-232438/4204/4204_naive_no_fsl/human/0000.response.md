Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, constructs a graph representing the city districts and the roads, and then finds the minimum subset of candidates needed to repair all problem roads in the city. The function `func_1` recursively finds the maximum depth node from a given starting node, ensuring that all problem roads are covered by the subset of candidates elected from that district. The program outputs the correct minimum subset of candidates required to repair all problem roads. Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
