The function `func_1` recursively traverses a tree structure representing a city. It updates the value in the `cand` dictionary to be the maximum between the current value and `no[0]` if the road represented by `no[1]` is a problem road. It marks visited districts in the `visitados` list and explores neighboring districts that have not been visited yet. The function does not have a specified return value.
