Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, roads are described by `[xi, yi, ti]`, `cand` dictionary is updated for problem roads, and `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False for at least one neighbor of `no[0]` in `grafo[no[0]`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, then the function `func_1()` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`.***
