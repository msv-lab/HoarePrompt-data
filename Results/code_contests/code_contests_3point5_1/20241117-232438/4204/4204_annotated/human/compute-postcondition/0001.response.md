Example Answer:
The value of 'cand['value']' is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the first element of 'no'. Since 'no[0]' represents the district number of the road, this operation is comparing the district number of the current road with the district number of the road stored in 'cand['value']'. If the district number of the current road is greater, it will update 'cand['value']' with this new maximum value. Other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of districts in the city. Each road is described by three positive integers xi, yi, ti where xi and yi represent the districts connected by the road, and ti is either 1 or 2 indicating whether the road is a problem road or not. The graph structure of the city is a tree. The road represented by no[1] is a problem road.**
