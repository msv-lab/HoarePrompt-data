According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the neighbors of the current node `no[0]`. If there is at least one neighbor whose `visitados` flag is False, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, roads are described by `[xi, yi, ti]`, `cand` dictionary is updated for problem roads, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, and there is at least one neighbor in `grafo[no[0]`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, the function `func_1` is called with the updated parameters. 

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, roads are described by `[xi, yi, ti]`, `cand` dictionary is updated for problem roads, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False for at least one neighbor of `no[0]` in `grafo[no[0]`.**
