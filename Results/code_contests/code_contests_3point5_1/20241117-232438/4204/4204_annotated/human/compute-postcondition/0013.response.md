Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, roads are described by `[xi, yi, ti]`, `cand` dictionary is updated for problem roads, and at least one neighbor of `no[0] in `grafo[no[0]` has `visitados` set to False. After the execution of the if statement, the program may recursively call `func_1` with parameters `vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand` if `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False.***
