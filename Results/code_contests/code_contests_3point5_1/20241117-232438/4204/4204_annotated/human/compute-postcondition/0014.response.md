According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more neighbors in `grafo[no[0]]` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, at least one neighbor of `no[0]` in `grafo[no[0]` has `visitados` set to False. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next neighbor `vizinho` must have `visitados[vizinho[0]]` as False. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, roads are described by `[xi, yi, ti]`, `cand` dictionary is updated for problem roads, and at least one neighbor of `no[0] in `grafo[no[0]` has `visitados` set to False. After the execution of the if statement, the program may recursively call `func_1` with parameters `vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand` if `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False.**
