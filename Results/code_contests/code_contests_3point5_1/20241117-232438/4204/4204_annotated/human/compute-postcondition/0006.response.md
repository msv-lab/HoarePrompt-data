Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The depth is incremented by 1, and the function is called recursively. The variables `n`, `roads`, and other variables are not affected by this function call. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, roads are described by `[xi, yi, ti]`, `cand` dictionary is updated for problem roads, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, there is at least one neighbor in `grafo[no[0]`, and the function `func_1` is called with the updated parameters.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, roads are described by `[xi, yi, ti]`, `cand` dictionary is updated for problem roads, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, there is at least one neighbor in `grafo[no[0]`, and the function `func_1` is called with the updated parameters**
