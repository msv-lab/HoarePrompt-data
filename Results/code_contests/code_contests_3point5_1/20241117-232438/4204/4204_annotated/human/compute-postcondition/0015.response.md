Output State: **After the loop executes, the program recursively calls `func_1` for each neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]` that has `visitados[vizinho[0]]` set to False. The `cand` dictionary is updated for problem roads, and `visitados` array keeps track of visited districts. If there are no neighbors with `visitados[vizinho[0]]` set to False, the loop does not execute.**
