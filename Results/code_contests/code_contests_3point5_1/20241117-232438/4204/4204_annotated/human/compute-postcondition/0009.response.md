Example Answer:
`func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The function likely performs some operations based on these parameters but the specific impact on the program cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, the output state cannot be accurately determined.
Output State: **Unknown**
