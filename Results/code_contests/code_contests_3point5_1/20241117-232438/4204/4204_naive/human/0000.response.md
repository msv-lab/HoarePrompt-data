Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the subset of candidates that, if elected, will ensure that all problem roads in the city will be repaired. The logic in the program seems to be incorrect as it does not follow the problem description. 
The issue lies in the function `func_1` where it tries to find the maximum value among the candidates connected to a district. This logic is flawed as it does not guarantee that the subset of candidates chosen will repair all the problem roads.
Additionally, the program does not consider the scenario where certain problem roads are connected to multiple districts, which can lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
