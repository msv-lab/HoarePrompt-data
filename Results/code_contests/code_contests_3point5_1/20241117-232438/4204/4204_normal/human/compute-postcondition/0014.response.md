According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `grafo[no[0]]` list. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `xi` and `yi` are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, `ti` is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` was initially False, then `func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand)` is executed. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the next `vizinho` in the `grafo[no[0]]` list needs to be considered.
State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, ti is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, visitados[no[0]] is set to True, visitados[vizinho[0]] is True, if visitados[vizinho[0]] was initially False, then func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand) is executed**.
