Output State: **After the loop executes, the function func_1 is called recursively on each neighbor node in the graph starting from the initial node 'no[0]'. The visitados list keeps track of visited nodes, with the current node 'no[0]' marked as visited. If a neighbor node has not been visited before, the function func_1 is called on that neighbor node. The loop will not execute if all neighbor nodes have already been visited.**
