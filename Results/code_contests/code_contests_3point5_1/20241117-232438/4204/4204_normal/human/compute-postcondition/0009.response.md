Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand`. The variables have specific values: `vizinho` is a positive integer, `grafo` is a graph data structure, `visitados` has `visitados[no[0]]` set to True, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not True, `depth` is a positive integer, and `cand` is a variable. After the function call, the state of the variables may change based on the function's implementation, but the exact values cannot be determined without knowing the internal workings of the function. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `xi` and `yi` are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, `ti` is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not True.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `xi` and `yi` are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, `ti` is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not True**
