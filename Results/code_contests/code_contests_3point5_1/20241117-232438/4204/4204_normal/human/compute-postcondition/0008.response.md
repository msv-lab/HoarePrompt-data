According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `grafo[no[0]]` and the conditions specified. At the end of the last iteration, n, xi, yi, ti, and visitados[no[0]] have specific constraints. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `visitados[vizinho[0]]` must be checked, and if it is not True, then `func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand)` is executed. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, ti is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, visitados[no[0]] is set to True, visitados[vizinho[0]] is not True**
