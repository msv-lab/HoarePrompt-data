According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition that `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not True. If this condition is met, then `func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand)` is executed. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True, and `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is not True. For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True. 

State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, ti is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, visitados[no[0]] is set to True, visitados[vizinho[0]] is True**
