Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, xi, yi, and ti are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and 1 <= ti <= 2. If no[1] is true, the 'value' key in the 'cand' dictionary is updated to the maximum value between the current 'value' and no[0]. Otherwise, there is no change in the 'value' key.***
