Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, ti is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, visitados[no[0]] is set to True, visitados[vizinho[0]] is True. If visitados[vizinho[0]] was initially False, then func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand) is executed.***
