Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The variables `vizinho`, `grafo`, `depth`, and `cand` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The function call increases the depth by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, ti is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, visitados[no[0]] is set to True, visitados[vizinho[0]] is True.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n, ti is a positive integer such that 1 <= ti <= 2, visitados[no[0]] is set to True, visitados[vizinho[0]] is True**
