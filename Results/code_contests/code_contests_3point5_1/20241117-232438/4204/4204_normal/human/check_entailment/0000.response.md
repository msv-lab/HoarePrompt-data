Correctness: **False**

The code does not seem to accurately follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to recursively traverse a graph starting from a given node and update the 'value' key in the dictionary `cand` to the maximum value between the current 'value' and the node value if a certain condition is met. However, there are multiple issues in the code:
1. The function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which will result in a NameError.
2. The function `func_1` does not return any value, but it is expected to update the 'value' key in the dictionary `cand` with the maximum value.
3. The code has duplicated sections of code that are unnecessary and can lead to confusion and potential errors.
4. The code is also missing the cases where a road is not a problem road, which should be considered in the traversal logic.

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the discrepancies between the actual code and the problem description.
