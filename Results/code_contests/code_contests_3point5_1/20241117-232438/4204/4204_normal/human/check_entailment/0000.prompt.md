You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The city Valera lives in is going to hold elections to the city Parliament.

The city has n districts and n - 1 bidirectional roads. We know that from any district there is a path along the roads to any other district. Let's enumerate all districts in some way by integers from 1 to n, inclusive. Furthermore, for each road the residents decided if it is the problem road or not. A problem road is a road that needs to be repaired.

There are n candidates running the elections. Let's enumerate all candidates in some way by integers from 1 to n, inclusive. If the candidate number i will be elected in the city Parliament, he will perform exactly one promise — to repair all problem roads on the way from the i-th district to the district 1, where the city Parliament is located.

Help Valera and determine the subset of candidates such that if all candidates from the subset will be elected to the city Parliament, all problem roads in the city will be repaired. If there are several such subsets, you should choose the subset consisting of the minimum number of candidates.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of districts in the city.

Then n - 1 lines follow. Each line contains the description of a city road as three positive integers xi, yi, ti (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2) — the districts connected by the i-th bidirectional road and the road type. If ti equals to one, then the i-th road isn't the problem road; if ti equals to two, then the i-th road is the problem road.

It's guaranteed that the graph structure of the city is a tree.

Output

In the first line print a single non-negative number k — the minimum size of the required subset of candidates. Then on the second line print k space-separated integers a1, a2, ... ak — the numbers of the candidates that form the required subset. If there are multiple solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.

for i in xrange(1, n):
    (a, b, t) = map(int, raw_input().split())

            func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand)
n = int(raw_input())
grafo = [[] for _ in xrange(n + 1)]
for i in xrange(1, n):
    (a, b, t) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    grafo[a].append((b, False if t == 1 else True))
    grafo[b].append((a, False if t == 1 else True))

vizinhos = grafo[1]
visitados[1] = True
candi = []
for vizinho in vizinhos:
    maxi = {'value': -1}
    func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, 1, maxi)
    if maxi['value'] != -1:
        candi.append(maxi['value'])
print(len(set(candi)))
print(' '.join(list(set(map(str, candi)))))
```
Output hints: The function `func_1` recursively traverses a graph starting from a given node `no[0]`. It updates the 'value' key in the dictionary `cand` to the maximum value between the current 'value' and no[0] if no[1] is true. The function marks the current node as visited in the `visitados` list and then recursively calls itself on each unvisited neighbor node in the graph. There is no specific return value mentioned in the annotations.

First I want you to try to see if the code does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code must exactly follow the problem description for all cases to be correct.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
