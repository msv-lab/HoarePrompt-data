The function `func_1` recursively traverses a graph starting from a given node `no[0]`. It updates the 'value' key in the dictionary `cand` to the maximum value between the current 'value' and no[0] if no[1] is true. The function marks the current node as visited in the `visitados` list and then recursively calls itself on each unvisited neighbor node in the graph. There is no specific return value mentioned in the annotations.
