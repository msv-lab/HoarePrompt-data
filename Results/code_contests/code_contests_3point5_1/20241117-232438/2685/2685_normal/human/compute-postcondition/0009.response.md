According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If there are more candies in the array, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and the conditions about `res` being incremented and `res_map` being updated have been followed as described. The `candy_array` has at least 1 candy, and `candy` is the first candy in the array.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the condition in the if-else block was met, then `res` would be incremented by 2 and a value in `res_map` would be decremented. Therefore, the state of `res` and `res_map` needs to be adjusted accordingly based on the previous iteration's execution.
2. The `candy_array` needs to have at least one more candy for the loop to execute again.

State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies, `candy` is the second candy in the array**
