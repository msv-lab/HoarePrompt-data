Example Answer: 
The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it is known that `res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies, and `candy` is the second candy in the array. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies, `candy` is the second candy in the array, `res` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies, `candy` is the second candy in the array, `res` is incremented by 2**
