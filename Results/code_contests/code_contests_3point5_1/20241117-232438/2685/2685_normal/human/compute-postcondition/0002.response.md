According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the candy_array. If the array has at least 1 candy, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res_map` is an empty dictionary does not have a direct impact on the loop execution, but `res` being 0 does not ensure the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, the candy_array must have at least 1 candy, and `res` should be 0, and `candy` should be the first candy in the array.

State: **`res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, candy_array has at least 1 candy, `candy` is the first candy in the array**
