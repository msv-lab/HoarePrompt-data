Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If `res_map` has a key equal to `k - candy % k` and the associated value is greater than 0, then `res` is incremented by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if there is no key equal to `k - candy % k` in `res_map` or the value associated with that key is not greater than 0, then a new key `candy % k` is added to `res_map` with a value of 1 if `res_map` does not already have that key present. `res` is either 0 or 2 based on the condition in the if-else block. `candy_array` has at least 1 candy and `candy` is the first candy in the array.***
