Output State: **If candy_array is empty, the loop does not execute and res_map remains an empty dictionary with res equal to 0. If candy_array has at least one candy, the loop iterates through each candy, updating res_map based on the conditions provided in the if-else block. The final state of res_map will contain adjusted key-value pairs based on the calculations performed during the loop. The value of res will be the sum of all increments (2) made throughout the loop.**
