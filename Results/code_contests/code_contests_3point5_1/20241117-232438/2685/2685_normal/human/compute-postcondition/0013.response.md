Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 2 candies, `candy` is the second candy in the array. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` and the value is greater than 0, `res` is incremented by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, the value at key `candy % k` in `res_map` is increased by 1 if the key exists in `res_map`, otherwise it is set to 1. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if-else block.***
