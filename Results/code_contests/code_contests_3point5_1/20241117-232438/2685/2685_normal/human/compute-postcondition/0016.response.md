Example Answer:
The value of `candy` is the third candy in the array, and the value of `k` is derived from `candy` in the expression. The value of `res` is increased by 2 before the operation. The dictionary `res_map` is modified by decreasing the value of the key `k - candy % k` by 1. The output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 3 candies, `candy` is the third candy in the array, and `res` is increased by 2. 
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 3 candies, `candy` is the third candy in the array, and `res` is increased by 2**.
