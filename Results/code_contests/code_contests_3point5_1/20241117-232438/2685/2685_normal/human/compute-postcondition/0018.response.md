Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 3 candies, `candy` is the third candy in the array. If `res_map` has the key (k - candy % k) and the value at that key is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value at the key (k - candy % k) in `res_map` is decreased by 1. If the condition is not met, the value at the key (candy % k) in `res_map` is either incremented by 1 if the key exists in `res_map`, or initialized to 1 if the key does not exist. This covers all scenarios for the execution of the if else block.***
