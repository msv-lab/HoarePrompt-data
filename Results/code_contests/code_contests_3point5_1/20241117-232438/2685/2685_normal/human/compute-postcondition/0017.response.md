Example Answer:
The code snippet increments the value stored in the `res_map` dictionary at the key `candy % k` by 1 if the key exists, otherwise it initializes it to 1. Since `candy` is the third candy in the `candy_array`, it is assumed to have a value. The output state will be: `res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 3 candies, `candy` is the third candy in the array, and the value at `candy % k` key in `res_map` is either incremented or initialized to 1.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with adjusted key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least 3 candies, `candy` is the third candy in the array, and the value at `candy % k` key in `res_map` is either incremented or initialized to 1**
