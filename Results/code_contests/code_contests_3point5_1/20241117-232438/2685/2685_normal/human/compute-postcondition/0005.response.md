Example Answer:
The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. Since the key `k - candy % k` exists in `res_map` and its corresponding value is greater than 0, the value in `res_map[k - candy % k]` will be reduced by 1 without causing any issues. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 2, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy, `candy` is the first candy in the array, and the value at key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 2, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy, `candy` is the first candy in the array, and the value at key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decremented by 1**
