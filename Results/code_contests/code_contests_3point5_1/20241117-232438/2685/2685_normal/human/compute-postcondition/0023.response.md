Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `k` and `candy_array`. It iterates through the `candy_array` and updates a dictionary `res_map` based on certain conditions. If a specific key-value pair in `res_map` meets certain criteria, the result `res` is incremented by 2. There is no specified return value in the constraints. The function may encounter issues such as a KeyError if certain keys are not present in `res_map`.**
