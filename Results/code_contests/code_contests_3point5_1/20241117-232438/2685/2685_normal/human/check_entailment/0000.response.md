Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters `k` and `candy_array`, then iterates through the `candy_array` to determine the maximum number of boxes Polycarp can give as gifts. It appropriately updates the dictionary `res_map` based on the condition where if a specific key-value pair in `res_map` meets certain criteria, the result `res` is incremented by 2. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness.
