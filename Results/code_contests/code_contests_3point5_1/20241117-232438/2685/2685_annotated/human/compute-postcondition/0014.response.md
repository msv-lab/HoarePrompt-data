According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the candy_array. If there are more candies in the candy_array, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs. The state of `res` and `candy_array` remains unchanged. 

To execute the loop one more time, the candy_array should still have more candies. No adjustments need to be made to the existing states for the loop to execute again.

State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged**
