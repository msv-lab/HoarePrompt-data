Example Answer:
The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. The initial values are known, so after execution, the corresponding value in `res_map` is reduced by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 2, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy, `candy` is the first candy in the array, and the value corresponding to key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 2, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy, `candy` is the first candy in the array, and the value corresponding to key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decreased by 1**
