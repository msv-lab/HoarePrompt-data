Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and the value at that key is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` is decremented by 1. If the condition is not met, a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1 or the value at key `candy % k` is incremented by 1 if it already exists. `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged.***
