Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the `res_map` dictionary by incrementing the value of the key `candy % k` by 1 if the key already exists, otherwise, it initializes the value to 1. The keys and values in `res_map` are updated based on the calculations. The variables `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged**
