Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs. If `res_map` has key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `res_map` does not have key `k - candy % k` or the corresponding value is not greater than 0, then a new key `candy % k` is added to `res_map` with a value of 1. In either case, `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
