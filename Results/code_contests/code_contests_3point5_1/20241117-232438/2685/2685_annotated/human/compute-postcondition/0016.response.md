Example Answer:
The value of `k - candy % k` is used as the key to access and update the value in `res_map`. The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The `candy_array` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `res` is incremented by 2, `candy_array` remains unchanged**
