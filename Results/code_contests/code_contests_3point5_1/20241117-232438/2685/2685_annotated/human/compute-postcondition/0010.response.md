Example Answer: 
The value of `res` is increased by 2. Since `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged, the output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1 or the value at key `k - candy % k` is decremented by 1, `res` is increased by 2. 
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1 or the value at key `k - candy % k` is decremented by 1, `res` is increased by 2**
