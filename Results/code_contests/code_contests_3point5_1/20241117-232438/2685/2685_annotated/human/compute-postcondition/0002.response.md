According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If the array has at least 1 candy, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res_map` is an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `candy_array` has at least 1 candy, `res` is 0, and `candy` is the first candy in the array.

State: **`res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, `candy_array` has at least 1 candy, `candy` is the first candy in the array**
