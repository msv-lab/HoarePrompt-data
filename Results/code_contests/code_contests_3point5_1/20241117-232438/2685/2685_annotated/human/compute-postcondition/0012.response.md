Example Answer:
The code increments the value at key `candy % k` in `res_map` by 1 if the key already exists, otherwise, it creates a new key `candy % k` with a value of 1 in `res_map`. The values of `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, and either a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1 or the value at key `candy % k` is incremented by 1; `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, and either a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1 or the value at key `candy % k` is incremented by 1; `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged**.
