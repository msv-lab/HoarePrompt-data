According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If there are more candies in the array, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs based on the conditions mentioned. For the loop to execute one more time, there are two possibilities:
1. If `res_map` does not have key `k - candy % k` or the corresponding value is not greater than 0, then a new key `candy % k` should be added to `res_map` with a value of 1.
2. If `res_map` has key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, then `res` should be increased by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` should be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, and either a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1 or `res` is increased by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` is decremented by 1. `res` and `candy_array` remain unchanged.**
