Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `res` is incremented by 2, `candy_array` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `res` is incremented by 2, `candy_array` remains unchanged**
