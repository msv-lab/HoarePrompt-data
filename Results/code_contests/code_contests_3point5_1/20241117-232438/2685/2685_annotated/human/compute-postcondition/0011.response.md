Example Answer: 
The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. The key `k - candy % k` is selected from the dictionary `res_map`, and its value is decremented by 1. The value of `res` is increased by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1 or the value at key `k - candy % k` is decremented by 1, `res` is increased by 2.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1 or the value at key `k - candy % k` is decremented by 1, `res` is increased by 2**
