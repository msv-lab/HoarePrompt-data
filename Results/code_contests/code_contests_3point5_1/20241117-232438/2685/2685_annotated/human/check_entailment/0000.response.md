Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided function iterates through the candy_array and uses a dictionary (res_map) to keep track of the number of candies with remainders when divided by k. It correctly identifies pairs of boxes that can be combined as gifts by checking if the sum of candies in two boxes is divisible by k. The function updates the res variable accordingly and prints the maximum number of boxes that can be given as gifts. 
The logic of the code aligns with the problem description provided, and the examples given in the problem description are correctly handled by the function. Hence, the code is correct.
