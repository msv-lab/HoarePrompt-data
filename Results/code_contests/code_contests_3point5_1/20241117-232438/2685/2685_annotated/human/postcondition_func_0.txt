The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k`, a positive integer, and `candy_array`, a list of positive integers. Within a for loop that iterates over the elements in `candy_array`, the function updates a dictionary `res_map` based on specific conditions related to the key-value pairs. If a certain key exists in `res_map` and meets certain criteria, the result `res` is incremented by 2 and the corresponding value in `res_map` is decremented. Otherwise, a new key is added to `res_map` with a value of 1. If `candy_array` is empty, no iterations occur. However, the code seems to have missing logic as it tries to access keys in `res_map` without initializing them properly, which could lead to errors.
