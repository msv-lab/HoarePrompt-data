Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not correctly calculate the maximum number of boxes that Polycarp can give as gifts. The logic in the `func_1` function is incorrect as it does not handle all cases where the sum of candies in two boxes is divisible by k. For example, in the input `7 3\n1 2 2 3 2 4 5\n`, the code will output `0` instead of the correct answer `4`. This is because the logic in the code does not consider all possible pairs of boxes that can form a gift. Hence, the code is incorrect.
