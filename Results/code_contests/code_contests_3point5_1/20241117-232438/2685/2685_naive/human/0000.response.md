Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function. The function is trying to maintain a dictionary called `res_map` to keep track of the remainders of candies when divided by `k`. However, the logic to update and check the dictionary is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
7 2
1 2 2 3 2 4 10
```
The expected output is 6, but the program will output some incorrect value due to the incorrect logic in handling the remainders of candies. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
