Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n. It iterates through the array in reverse order and keeps track of the occurrences of each element in a dictionary. Then, it calculates the sum based on the occurrences of the current element and its neighbors. The code accounts for all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code and accurately describe the functionality of the program. Hence, the code is correct.
