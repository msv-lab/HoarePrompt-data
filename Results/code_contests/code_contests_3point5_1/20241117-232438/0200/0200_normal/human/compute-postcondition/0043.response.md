Postcondition: ***n >= 1, i = n - 2, a is a list of integers, sm is the sum of all elements in a up to index n - 1 increased by a[i], cnt is updated with the sum of occurrences of a[i] in set m and m[a[i] - 1], diff is updated with the value of diff + a[i] * m[a[i], ans is updated with the new calculated value, m is updated with the count of occurrences of a[i] where a[i] is in set m and if not present, m[a[i]] is assigned the value 1. If a[i] is in set m, m[a[i]] is incremented by 1. If a[i] is in set m, cnt is incremented by the count of occurrences of a[i] in m and diff is incremented by a[i] multiplied by the count of occurrences of a[i] in m. If a[i] + 1 is in set m, cnt is further incremented by the count of occurrences of a[i] + 1 in m and diff is updated with the value of diff + (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]. If a[i] - 1 is in set m, cnt is incremented by the count of occurrences of a[i] - 1 in m and diff is updated with the value of diff + (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]. All other variables retain their previous values. ans is updated with the value of sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt). In addition, m[a[i]] is assigned the value 1 after the execution of the if-else block.***
