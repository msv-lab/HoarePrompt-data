Example Answer:
The input is split based on spaces, converted to integers, and stored in a list `a`. The initial state is `n` is an input integer. After execution, `a` will hold the list of integers entered as input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**
