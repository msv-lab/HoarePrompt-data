Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `sm` is 0, `cnt` is the sum of values in set `m` corresponding to elements in list `a`, `diff` is the sum of the products of each element in list `a` with its corresponding value in set `m`, and if the element at index `i` in list `a` is present in set `m`, `cnt` is updated to include the value of `m[a[i]]` and `diff` is updated to include the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. Additionally, if `a[i] + 1` is present in set `m`, then `cnt` is updated to include the value of `m[a[i] + 1]` and `diff` is updated to include the product of `a[i] + 1` and `m[a[i] + 1`**.
