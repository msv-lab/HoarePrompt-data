Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `sm` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `sm` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `sm` is 0**
