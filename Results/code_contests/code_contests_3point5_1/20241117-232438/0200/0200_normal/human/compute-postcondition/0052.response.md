Postcondition: ***`n` >= 1, `i` is equal to `n` - 3, `a` is a list of integers. If `a[i]` is present in set `m`, then `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is updated with the result of `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` is updated with the new calculated value. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, `m[a[i]]` is assigned the value 1. If `a[i] + 1` is in `m`, `cnt` is further increased by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated with the result of `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. This ensures that all cases are covered, and the program variables maintain their relationships as specified.***
