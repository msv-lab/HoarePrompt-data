Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the user input, then reads a list of integers `a`. It calculates a value `ans` based on the elements in list `a` and their occurrences in dictionary `m`. The function updates the values of `cnt` and `diff` based on the elements in `a` and their neighbors in `m`. Finally, it prints the calculated `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.**
