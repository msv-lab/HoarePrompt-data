Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `n - 1` increased by `a[i]`, `cnt` is updated with the sum of occurrences of `a[i]` in set `m` and `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is updated with the value of `diff + a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` is updated with the new calculated value, and `m` is updated with the count of occurrences of `a[i]` where `a[i]` is in set `m` and if not present, `m[a[i]]` is assigned the value 1. If `a[i]` is in set `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the count of occurrences of `a[i]` in `m` and `diff` is incremented by `a[i]` multiplied by the count of occurrences of `a[i]` in `m`. If `a[i] + 1` is in set `m`, `cnt` is further incremented by the count of occurrences of `a[i] + 1` in `m` and `diff` is updated with the value of `diff + (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` is in set `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the count of occurrences of `a[i] - 1` in `m` and `diff` is updated with the value of `diff + (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values. `ans` is updated with the value of `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**
