Example Answer:
The code updates `ans` by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. The previous values of `ans`, `sm`, `diff`, `a[i]`, `n`, and `cnt` are known. Therefore, we can calculate the new value of `ans` based on the given formula.
Output State: **Updated value of `ans` after the calculation**
