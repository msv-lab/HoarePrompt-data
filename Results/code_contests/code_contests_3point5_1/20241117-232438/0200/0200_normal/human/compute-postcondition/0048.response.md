Output State: **`n` >= 1, `i` = `n` - 3, `a` is a list of integers, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `n` - 1 increased by `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is updated with the result of the calculation `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` is updated with the new calculated value, `m` is updated with the count of occurrences of `a[i] where `a[i]` is in set `m` and if not present, `m[a[i]]` is assigned the value 1.**
