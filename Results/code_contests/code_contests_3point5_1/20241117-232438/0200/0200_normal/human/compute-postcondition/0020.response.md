Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by subtracting `diff` and `a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from `sm`. The previous values of the affected variables are known, so we can calculate the result.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `sm` is 0, `cnt` is the sum of values in set `m` corresponding to elements in list `a`, `diff` is the sum of the products of each element in list `a` with its corresponding value in set `m`, `ans` is updated with the new calculated value.**
