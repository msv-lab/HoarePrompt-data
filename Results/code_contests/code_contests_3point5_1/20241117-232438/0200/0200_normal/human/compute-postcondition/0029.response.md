Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `n - 1`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, `ans` is updated with the new calculated value, and if `a[i]` is in set `m`, then `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not in set `m`, then `m[a[i]]` is assigned the value 1**
