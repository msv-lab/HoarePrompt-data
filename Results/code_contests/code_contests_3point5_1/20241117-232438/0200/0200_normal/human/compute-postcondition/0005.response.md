According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop will iterate from `n - 1` down to 0. Since `n` is an input integer, it is already defined. At the start of the loop, `sm` is 0, so it does not need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of integers, but it does not affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `sm` is 0**
