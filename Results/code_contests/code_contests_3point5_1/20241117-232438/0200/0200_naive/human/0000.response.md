Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array. Then, it iterates through the array in reverse order and calculates the required sum based on the formula provided in the problem description. The program covers all possible cases and correctly calculates the sum for each pair of elements in the array. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, making it correct.
