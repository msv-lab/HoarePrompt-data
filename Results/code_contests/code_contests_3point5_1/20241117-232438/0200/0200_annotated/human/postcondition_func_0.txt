The function reads an integer `n` from user input, then reads a list of integers `a`. It calculates the sum of all integers in list `a` based on specific conditions within a for loop. The final sum is printed as the output. However, the function lacks clear postconditions and edge case handling such as handling invalid inputs or empty lists.
