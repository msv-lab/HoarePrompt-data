Correctness: True

Explanation: 
- The program takes input as described in the problem statement.
- It correctly calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.
- The logic inside the for loop correctly calculates the required differences and updates the variables `sm`, `m`, and `ans` accordingly.
- The program prints the final calculated sum as the output.

Therefore, based on the provided annotations and the code logic, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
