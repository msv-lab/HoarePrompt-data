Example Answer:
`cnt` is updated by adding the value of `m[a[i]]`, where `a[i]` is the ith element of list `a`. The value of `cnt` is incremented accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary updated according to specified conditions, `cnt` is updated, `diff` is 0, `ans` is updated, `i` is `i - 1`**
