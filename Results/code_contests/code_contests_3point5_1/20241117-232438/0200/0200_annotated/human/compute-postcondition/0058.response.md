Example Answer:
The value of `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `a[i]` represents an element from the list `a`. The dictionary `m` is updated accordingly. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary with updated values, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary with updated values, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `ans` and `i` remain unchanged**
