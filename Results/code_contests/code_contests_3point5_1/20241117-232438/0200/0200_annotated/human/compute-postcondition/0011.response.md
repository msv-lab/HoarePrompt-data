Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9. `sm` remains 0. `m` is a dictionary with keys from list `a`. `ans` stays 0. If the element a[i] is present in dictionary `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the value corresponding to a[i] in dictionary `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of a[i] and its corresponding value in dictionary `m`. All variables maintain their initial conditions, and the program successfully handles the case when a[i] is not found in dictionary `m`.***
