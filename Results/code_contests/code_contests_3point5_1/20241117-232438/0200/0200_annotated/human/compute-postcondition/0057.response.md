Example Answer:
The value of `sm` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `ans` and `i` remain unchanged**
