Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary where if `a[i]` is already a key, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise a new key-value pair is added with `a[i]` as the key and 1 as the value. `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.***
