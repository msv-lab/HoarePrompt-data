Example Answer:
`sm` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0**
