Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary with keys from list `a`, `ans` is 0. If the element `a[i]` is present in dictionary `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the value corresponding to `a[i] + 1` in dictionary `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and its corresponding value in dictionary `m`.**
