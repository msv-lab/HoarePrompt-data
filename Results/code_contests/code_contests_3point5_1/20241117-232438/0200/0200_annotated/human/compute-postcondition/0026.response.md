Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `sm` is increased by the value of `a[i]`, `m` is a dictionary with keys from list `a`. If `a[i]` is already present in `m`, then its corresponding value is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not present in `m`, it is added to `m` with a value of 1. Additionally, `ans` is updated based on the changes in `m`. The variables `cnt` and `diff` are also updated accordingly.***
