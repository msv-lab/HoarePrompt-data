Example Answer:
The dictionary `m` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, and `m` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, and `m` is an empty dictionary**
