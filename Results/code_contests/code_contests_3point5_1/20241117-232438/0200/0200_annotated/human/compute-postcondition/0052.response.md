Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary. If `a[i] + 1` exists in `m`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]`, `diff` is incremented by the product of `a[i] + 1` and `m[a[i] + 1]`, `ans` and `i` are updated accordingly, and `i` is decremented by 1. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if statement, ensuring the correct updating of variables and dictionary based on the conditions specified.***
