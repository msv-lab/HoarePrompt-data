Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers. If the element at index i in list `a` is present in dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is updated by adding the value associated with `a[i]` in `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and its corresponding value in `m`. If the element at index i in list `a` is not in dictionary `m`, no changes occur in any of the variables. After the execution of the if statement, `cnt` and `diff` may have been updated based on the conditions met in the if block for `a[i] + 1` being in dictionary `m`. The other variables retain their original values.***
