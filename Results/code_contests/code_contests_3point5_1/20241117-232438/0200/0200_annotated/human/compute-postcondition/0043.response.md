Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary where if `a[i]` is already a key, its value is increased by 1; otherwise, a new key-value pair is added to `m`. Additionally, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on the conditions specified. `ans` is updated by subtracting `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt) after executing the if statement.***
