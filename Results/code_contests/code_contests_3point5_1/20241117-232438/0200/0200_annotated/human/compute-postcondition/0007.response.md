Example Answer:
The variable `diff` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0**
