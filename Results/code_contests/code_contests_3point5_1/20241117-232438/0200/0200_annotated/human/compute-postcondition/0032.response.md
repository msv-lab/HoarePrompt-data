Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers. If the element at index i in list `a` is present in dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is updated by adding the value associated with `a[i]` in `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and its corresponding value in `m`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. If the element at index i in list `a` is not in dictionary `m`, no changes occur in any of the variables.***
