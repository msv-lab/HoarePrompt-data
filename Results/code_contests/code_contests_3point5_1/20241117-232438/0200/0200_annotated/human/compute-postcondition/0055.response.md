Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary. If `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is incremented by the product of `a[i] - 1` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged. The postcondition covers all scenarios where `a[i] - 1` is present in `m` or not. If `a[i] - 1` is in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` are updated accordingly. If `a[i] - 1` is not in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` retain their previous values. `ans` and `i` are not affected by the if statement.***
