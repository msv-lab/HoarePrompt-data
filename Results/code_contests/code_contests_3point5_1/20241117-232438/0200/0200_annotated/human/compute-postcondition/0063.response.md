Output State: **If n is at least 1, after the loop execution, `sm` will be the sum of all elements in list `a`, `m` will be a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique element in list `a`, `ans` will be the final calculated value based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `cnt` and `diff` will be updated in each iteration. If n is 0, the loop will not execute, and `sm`, `m`, and `ans` will retain their initial values of 0.**
