Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated with a key-value pair where the key is `a[i]` and the value is `1`. The dictionaries are mutable, so the value of `m` changes to include this new key-value pair. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary with the new key-value pair, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, and `ans` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary with the new key-value pair, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, and `ans` is updated accordingly**
