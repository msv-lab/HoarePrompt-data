Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary updated according to specified conditions. If `a[i]` exists in `m`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]` and `diff` is incremented by the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. The variables `ans` and `i` are updated accordingly, and `i` is decremented by 1. The postcondition encapsulates all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if statement.***
