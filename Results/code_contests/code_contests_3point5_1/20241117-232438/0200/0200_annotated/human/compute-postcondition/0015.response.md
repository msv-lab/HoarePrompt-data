Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` remains 0, `m` is a dictionary with keys from list `a`, `ans` stays 0. If the element a[i] is present in dictionary `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the value corresponding to a[i] in dictionary `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of a[i] and its corresponding value in dictionary `m`. After the execution of the if statement, if a[i] + 1 exists in dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is incremented by the value of m[a[i] + 1], and `diff` is updated by adding the product of (a[i] + 1) and m[a[i] + 1]. All variables retain their initial conditions, and the program accounts for cases where a[i] + 1 is not found in dictionary `m`.***
