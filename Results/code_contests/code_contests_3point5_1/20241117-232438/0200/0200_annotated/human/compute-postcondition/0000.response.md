Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer input using `raw_input()`. Since the precondition states that `n` is a positive integer, the value of `n` will be a positive integer after input. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9**
