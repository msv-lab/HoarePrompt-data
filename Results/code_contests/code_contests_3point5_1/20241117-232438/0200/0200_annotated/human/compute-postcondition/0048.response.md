Example Answer:
The value of `diff` is incremented by the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`, where `i` is `i - 1`. The previous values of `diff`, `a`, `m`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `i` are not given. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary updated according to specified conditions, `cnt` is updated, `diff` is increased by the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`, `ans` is updated, `i` is `i - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary updated according to specified conditions, `cnt` is updated, `diff` is increased by the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`, `ans` is updated, `i` is `i - 1`**
