Example Answer:
The value of `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. The variables `n`, `a`, `m`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary, `cnt` is updated based on the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is updated, `ans`, and `i` are unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary, `cnt` is updated based on the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is updated, `ans`, and `i` are unchanged**
