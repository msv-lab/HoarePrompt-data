According to the code, the loop is iterating over the range from `n-1` down to 0 in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary with certain conditions, `cnt`, `diff`, `sm`, `ans`, and `i` are updated.
For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` should be decremented by 1 and all other states should remain the same.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `m` is a dictionary, `cnt` and `diff` are updated, `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `ans` and `i` is decremented**
