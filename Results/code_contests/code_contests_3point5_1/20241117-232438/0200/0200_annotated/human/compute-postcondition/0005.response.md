According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `n` is already a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for that. However, since the loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `0`, the loop will execute `n` times. Therefore, `sm` should be adjusted to 0, `m` should be initialized as an empty dictionary, and `ans` should be set to 0 before the loop starts.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0**
