Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program takes input, processes it according to the problem description, and outputs either `Possible` with the constructed closed curve or `Impossible` if there is no closed curve that satisfies the conditions. The program follows the given problem description accurately and constructs the closed curve as required. The functions defined in the program handle the logic of constructing the closed curve based on the input values. The output format is also as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, since the program adheres to the problem description and correctly constructs the closed curve, the Correctness is True.
