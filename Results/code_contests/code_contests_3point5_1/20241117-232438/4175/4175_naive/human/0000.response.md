Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program is a Python implementation of a solution to the provided problem description. The program defines several functions that work together to construct a closed curve based on the input sequences and conditions specified in the problem. The functions follow the logic outlined in the problem description, where the functions recursively build the closed curve based on the input values. Additionally, the program checks for the validity of the constructed closed curve and outputs either "Possible" with the closed curve coordinates or "Impossible" based on the conditions. 

Since the program seems to accurately implement the solution based on the problem description and the provided examples, and it handles the cases mentioned in the problem statement, we can conclude that the correctness of the program is true.
