According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ret_path containing tuples. If there is at least one more tuple in ret_path, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, ret_path contains at least 1 tuple, x and y are the values in the first tuple of ret_path. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there should be at least 2 tuples in ret_path.
State: **`ret_path` contains at least 2 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the second tuple of `ret_path`**
