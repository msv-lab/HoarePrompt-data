According to the code, the loop can execute again if `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1 and `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ind` needs to be adjusted to be less than the updated value of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is an integer that is one less than the current value, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N based on the condition specified in the list comprehension, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is 2, `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`**
