Output State: **The code snippet assigns `ret_path` the value of a list comprehension, where it appends tuples generated by calling `func_4` with each value in `ret_gp`. If the loop executes, `ret_path` will be updated with the resulting list. The variables `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `i`, `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `ret_gp` are not directly affected by this code snippet and will retain their initial values.**
