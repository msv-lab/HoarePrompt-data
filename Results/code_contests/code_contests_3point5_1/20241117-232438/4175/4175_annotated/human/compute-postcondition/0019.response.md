Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is True. If `s2[i]` is '0', the loop checks for each index `ind` in the range of `n` if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` == '1') holds true, then sets `ok` to False. After the loop, `ret_gp` is appended with the return value of `func_2(s)`. The postcondition covers all possible states of the variables after the execution of the if block, considering the edge cases of the loop conditions and variable modifications.***
