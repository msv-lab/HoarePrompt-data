Output State: **If `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is an integer, `s` is a list, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is the current index in the loop, `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`**
