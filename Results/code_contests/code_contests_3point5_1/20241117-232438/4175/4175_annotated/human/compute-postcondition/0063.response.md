Example Answer:
The code prints the values of `x` and `y` with a space in between. The values of `x` and `y` are the values in the third tuple of `ret_path. Therefore, the output state is: `ret_path` contains at least 3 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the third tuple of `ret_path.
Output State: **`ret_path` contains at least 3 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the third tuple of `ret_path**
