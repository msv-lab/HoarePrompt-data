Example Answer:
The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment changes the value of `ok` to `False`, irrespective of the previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, and `ok` is False.
Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, and `ok` is False**
