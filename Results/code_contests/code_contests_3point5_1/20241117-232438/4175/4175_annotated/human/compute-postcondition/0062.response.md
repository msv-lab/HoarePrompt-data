According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ret_path`. If `ret_path` contains at least 3 tuples, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` contains at least 2 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the second tuple of `ret_path`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ret_path` must contain at least 3 tuples, and `x` and `y` should be the values in the third tuple of `ret_path`.
State: **`ret_path` contains at least 3 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the third tuple of `ret_path**
