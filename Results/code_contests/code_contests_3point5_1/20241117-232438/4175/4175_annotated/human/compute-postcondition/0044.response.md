Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is an integer that is one less than the current value, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N based on the condition specified in the list comprehension, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is 1, `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is met, then `ok` is set to False. This update only occurs if the specified conditions are satisfied, otherwise the variables remain unchanged.***
