According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range specified in the `range` function. At the end of the last iteration, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is an integer, `s` is a list, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is the current index in the loop, and `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted within the range of the `range` function. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from `2 ** n - 1` to -1, the next iteration would require adjusting `i` to be one less than the current value. 
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is an integer that is one less than the current value, `s` is a list, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is the current index in the loop, and `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`**
