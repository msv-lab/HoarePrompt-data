Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer greater than 0. `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s. `ok` is either True or False based on the conditions. `i` is an integer. `s` is a list. `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is met, then `ok` is set to False. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the if else block executes, ensuring the correct state of the program variables.***
