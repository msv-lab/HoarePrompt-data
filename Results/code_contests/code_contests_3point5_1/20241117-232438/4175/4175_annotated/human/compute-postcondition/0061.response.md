Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are extracted from the second tuple of `ret_path` and then converted to strings before being concatenated and printed. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state is: `ret_path` contains at least 2 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the second tuple of `ret_path`.
Output State: **`ret_path` contains at least 2 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the second tuple of `ret_path`**
