Functionality: ** The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, and `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s. The function then performs operations on the variables `ok`, `n`, `ret_gp`, `i`, `s`, `ind`, and `ret_path` based on the conditions specified in the code. If `ok` is true and `ret_path` is not empty, the function prints 'Possible', the length of `ret_path` minus 1, and each tuple's elements in `ret_path`. If `ok` is false or `ret_path` is empty, the function prints 'Impossible'.**
