According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s. If ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2, the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s**.
