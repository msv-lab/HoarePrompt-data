According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ret_path`. If `ret_path` contains at least 4 tuples, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` contains at least 3 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the third tuple of `ret_path`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `ret_path` must contain at least 4 tuples, and the values of `x` and `y` should be from the fourth tuple.
State: **`ret_path` contains at least 4 tuples, `x` and `y` are the values in the fourth tuple of `ret_path**
