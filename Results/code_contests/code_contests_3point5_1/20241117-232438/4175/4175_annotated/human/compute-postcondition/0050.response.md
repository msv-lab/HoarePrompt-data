Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with the parameter `s`, and the return value is added to `ret_gp`. The initial state specifies that `ok` is False, and it remains False if `n` is 0 or if `'1'` is not present at the specific index of `s2`. Since no information is provided about the values of `n` and `s2`, we cannot determine if the loop executes or not. Therefore, the output state is: `ok` is False.
Output State: **`ok` is False**
