Example Answer: 
The code prints the values of `x` and `y` from the first tuple in `ret_path`. Therefore, the output state is: `ret_path` contains at least 1 tuple, `x` and `y` are the values in the first tuple of `ret_path`.
Output State: **`ret_path` contains at least 1 tuple, `x` and `y` are the values in the first tuple of `ret_path`**
