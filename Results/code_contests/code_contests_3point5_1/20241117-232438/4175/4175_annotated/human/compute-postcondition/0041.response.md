Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is an integer that is one less than the current value, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N based on the condition specified in the list comprehension, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is 0, `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`. In the case where the binary representation of `i` at position `ind` is even and the element in `s2` at index `i + 2 ** ind` is '1', `ok` is set to False. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
