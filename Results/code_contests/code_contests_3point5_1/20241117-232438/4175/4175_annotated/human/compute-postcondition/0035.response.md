Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is an integer, `s` is a list, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is the current index in the loop, and `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is '0', the loop iterates over `ind` from 0 to `n`, and if the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', `ok` is set to False. Finally, `ret_gp` is updated with the result of `func_2(s)` based on the sequence `s`.***
