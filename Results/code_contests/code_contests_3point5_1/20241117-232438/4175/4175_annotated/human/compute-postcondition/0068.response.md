Postcondition: ***`ret_path` is a list where each element is a tuple generated by calling `func_4` with the corresponding element in `ret_gp`. If `ok` is true and `ret_path` is not empty, the loop iterates through `ret_path` tuples, and `x` and `y` take on the values in each tuple. The program prints 'Possible', the length of `ret_path` minus 1, and each tuple's elements in `ret_path`. If `ok` is false or `ret_path` is empty, the program prints 'Impossible'. The variables `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `i`, `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values after the execution of the if else block.***
