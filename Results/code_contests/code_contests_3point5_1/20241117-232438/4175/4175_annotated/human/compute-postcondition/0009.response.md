Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is True if ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') is not satisfied for any value of `i` and `ind`, `n` is an integer value converted from `s1`, `ret_gp` is a list of integers ranging from 2^n - 1 to 0 in descending order, `s` is a list of integers where each element is v + 1 for v in range(n) if (i >> v) % 2 == 1, and the element at index i in `s2` is '0', `ind` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.***
