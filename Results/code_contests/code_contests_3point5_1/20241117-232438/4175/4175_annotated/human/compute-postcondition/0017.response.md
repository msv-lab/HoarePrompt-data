Output State: **After the loop executes, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s. `ok` is True if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') is False for all iterations. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.**
