Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is 0. If (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1', then `ok` is set to False.***
