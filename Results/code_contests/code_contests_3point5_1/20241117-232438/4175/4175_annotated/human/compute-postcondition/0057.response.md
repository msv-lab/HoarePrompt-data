Example Answer:
The `print` statement outputs the length of `ret_path` minus 1. Since no modifications are made to the initial state, the length of `ret_path` remains the same. Therefore, the output will be one less than the original length of `ret_path`.
Output State: **`ret_path` is a list containing tuples generated by calling `func_4` with each value in `ret_gp`, `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `i`, `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. The program prints 'Possible'.**
