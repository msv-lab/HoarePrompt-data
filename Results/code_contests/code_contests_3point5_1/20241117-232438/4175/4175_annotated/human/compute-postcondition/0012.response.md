Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, and `ok` is True if ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] is less than N+1. If ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1', then `ok` is set to False.***
