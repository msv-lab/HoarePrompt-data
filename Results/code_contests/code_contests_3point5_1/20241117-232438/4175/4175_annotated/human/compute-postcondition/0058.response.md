According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `ret_path` contains at least 1 tuple. Additionally, the values of `x` and `y` in the first tuple of `ret_path` need to be specified for the loop to execute.
State: **`ret_path` contains at least 1 tuple, `x` and `y` are the values in the first tuple of `ret_path`**
