Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N greater than 0, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N containing only 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `i` is an integer that is one less than the current value, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N based on the condition specified in the list comprehension, `n` is the integer value represented by `s1`, `ind` is the current index in the loop, and `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is '0', the loop iterates over `ind` from 0 to n-1. If `(i >> ind) % 2` is 0 and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` remains False. After the loop, `ret_gp` is updated by the result of `func_2(s)`. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if else block executes.***
