The function func_3 accepts an integer parameter v. If v is greater than 0, the function returns a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a number and a binary digit (0 or 1) based on certain conditions. If v is less than 0, the function returns the reversed result of func_3(-v). If v is 0, no action is taken. It is important to note that the function is limited to handling positive integers within the range 1 to 8.
