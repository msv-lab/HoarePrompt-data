Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines multiple functions to handle the construction of a closed curve based on the given problem description. The functions are designed to process the input data and generate the required output in the specified format. The functions utilize recursion and loops to iterate through the input data and construct the closed curve accordingly.

The functions handle different scenarios based on the input values and conditions specified in the problem description. The program prints "Possible" if a closed curve satisfying the conditions exists and constructs the curve as required. If there is no closed curve that satisfies the condition, the program correctly prints "Impossible".

Overall, the program structure aligns with the problem description, and the functions are implemented to fulfill the requirements. Since no specific case has been identified where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the code is evaluated as **True**.
