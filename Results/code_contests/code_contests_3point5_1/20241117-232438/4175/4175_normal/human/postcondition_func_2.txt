The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `v` and returns a list of tuples based on a specific pattern. If `v` is greater than 0, the function generates a list starting from 1 up to `v` with 0 as the second element, then includes (v, 1), (v-1, 1), and finally integers from v-1 down to 1 with 0 as the second element. If `v` is less than 0, the function returns the reversed result of applying `func_3` to the negative value of `v`. If `v` is not less than 0, there is no change in the state of the program variables.
