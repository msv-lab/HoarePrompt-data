Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as the provided examples, it seems that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The functions are implemented to handle the given input format and constraints, and the output generation also aligns with the expected output format specified in the problem description. Additionally, the implementation seems to cover all the necessary calculations and conditions to determine the existence of a closed curve that satisfies the given conditions. Since no specific edge cases or discrepancies were identified between the code and the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
