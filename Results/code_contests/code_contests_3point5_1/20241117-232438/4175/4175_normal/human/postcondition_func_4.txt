The function `func_5` calls another function `func_6` with two string arguments '1' and '11'. However, the `func_5` function itself does not accept any parameters. The annotations mention generating all possible binary strings of length N, but there is no actual implementation for this in the code provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is limited to invoking `func_6` with specific arguments and does not generate binary strings as mentioned in the annotations.
