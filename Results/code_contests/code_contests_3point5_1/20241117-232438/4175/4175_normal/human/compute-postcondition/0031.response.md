Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block, the program variables are in the following states: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -1, `ind` is in the range of 0 to n+1. The condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2**ind] == '1' results in assigning False to `ok` if satisfied. All other variables remain unchanged.***
