According to the code, the loop execution depends on the length of `ret_path` and the index of the current iteration. To execute one more time, the length of `ret_path` must be greater than the index of the current iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N,
`s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s,
`ok` is True,
`n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1,
`ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s),
`s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0',
`i` is greater than or equal to -1,
`ret_path` is updated with a list that starts with (0,0) followed by tuples generated from applying func_4 to the values in `ret_gp`,
`print('Possible')`,
the length of `ret_path` is greater than the index of the current iteration,
`x` and `y` are printed.

To execute one more time, the length of `ret_path` should be greater than the index of the current iteration + 1.
