Example Answer:
The variable `ok` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: s1 is a string representing a positive integer N, s2 is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s. ok is True.
Output State: **Precondition: s1 is a string representing a positive integer N, s2 is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s. ok is True**
