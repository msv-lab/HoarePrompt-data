According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is in the range from `2 ** n - 1` to -1. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True or False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -2.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be within the range from `2 ** n - 1` to -1. Since the loop is currently iterating in reverse order, the next value of `i` would be the current value of `i` minus 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` should be `i - 1`.

State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True or False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -3.**
