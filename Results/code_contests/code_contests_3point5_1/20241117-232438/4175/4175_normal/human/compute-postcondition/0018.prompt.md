You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `z` is 0
```
y = x
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`y` is assigned the value of `x`, and `x` is 1, so after execution, `y` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `z` is 0.
Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 1, `z` is 0**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `n` is 0, `m` is 2
```
return n
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
The function returns `n`, and `n` has a value of 0, so the function returns 0. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is 0, `m` is 2, and the function returns 0.
Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 2, and the function returns 0**

Example 7:
Initial State: `x` is 0, `y` is 1
```
return 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
The function returns `1`, and `x` has a value of 0, and y has a value of 1. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `x` is 0, `y` is 2, and the function returns 1.
Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 1, and the function returns 1**

Your Task:
Initial State: Output State: 
The loop checks if the conditions `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'` are met for each `ind` in the range of `n`. If the conditions are met at any point, `ok` is set to False. The loop will execute for all values of `ind` from 0 to `n-1`. 
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `ok` remains True.
At the end of the loop, the output state is: 
- `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N
- `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s
- `ok` is True if the conditions are not met, False if the conditions are met
- `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1
- `ret_gp` is an empty list
- `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position, and s2[i] is equal to '0'
- `ind` is the index being checked in the loop, ranging from 0 to n-1. If the loop does not execute, ind is not defined.
```
ret_gp += func_2(s)

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
