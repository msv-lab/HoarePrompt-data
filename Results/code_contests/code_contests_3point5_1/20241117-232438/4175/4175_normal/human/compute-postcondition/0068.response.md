Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is a boolean flag. If `ok` is True, 'Possible' is printed followed by the length of `ret_path` - 1, and each tuple in `ret_path` is printed as a concatenation of x and y. If `ret_path` is empty, the loop does not execute. After the loop, `ok` is True. If `ok` is False, 'Impossible' is printed. In this case, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -1. The condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2^ind] == '1') is not met for any `ind` in the range of 0 to n-1. The loop will execute if n is greater than 0. Additionally, `ret_gp` is incremented by the result of `func_2(s)`. `ret_path` is updated with a list that starts with (0,0) followed by tuples generated from applying func_4 to the values in `ret_gp`.***
