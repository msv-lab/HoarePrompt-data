According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ret_path` and `ret_gp`. If `ret_path` has at least one tuple and `ret_gp` has been updated with return values, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ok` is False, so it needs to be adjusted to `ok` is True to ensure the loop execution. The loop iterates over tuples (x, y) in `ret_path`, so for the loop to be executed, the first tuple in `ret_path` should be (0,0). 
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -1, `ret_path` is updated with a list that starts with (0,0) followed by tuples generated from applying func_4 to the values in `ret_gp`, `print('Possible')`, and the length of `ret_path` is printed after subtracting 1**.
