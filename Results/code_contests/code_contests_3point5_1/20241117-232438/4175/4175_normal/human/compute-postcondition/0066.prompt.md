You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True or False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -1. After the if statement executes, `ok` will be False if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2^ind] == '1') is met for any `ind` in the range of 0 to n-1 and the loop will not execute if n is less than or equal to 0. In such cases, the variables will retain their initial values. Additionally, `ret_gp` is incremented by the result of `func_2(s)`. `ret_path` is updated with a list that starts with (0,0) followed by tuples generated from applying func_4 to the values in `ret_gp`.
if condition:
```
if (ok):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
