According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2^n - 1 to -1. At the end of the previous iteration, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True or False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. Increment `i` by -1 to continue the loop iteration.
2. Update `s` to contain values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0'.
3. Check if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2^ind] == '1') is met for any `ind` in the range of 0 to n-1 and update `ok` accordingly.
4. Increment `ret_gp` by the result of `func_2(s)`.

State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True or False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -2.**
