Functionality: **The function `func_6` takes two parameters `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N and `s2` is a sequence of 0s and 1s. The function processes the input strings and performs various operations based on conditions within loops. It constructs `ret_gp` by calling `func_2` on certain values, then generates `ret_path` by calling `func_4` on elements of `ret_gp`. Depending on the value of `ok`, it either prints information about the paths or 'Impossible'. The function does not have a specific return value specified in the provided description.**
