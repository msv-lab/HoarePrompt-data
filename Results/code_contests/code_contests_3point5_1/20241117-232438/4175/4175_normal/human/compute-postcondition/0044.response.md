Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N where N is at least 1, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -2, `ind` is n. If the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') is true, `ok` is set to False. The loop can execute again based on the variables `ind` and `n`, where at the end of the last iteration, `ind` ranges from 0 to n-1. To execute the loop one more time, `ind` is adjusted to the next value after n-1, which is n. No other states need adjustment.***
