Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True or False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -2. If s2[i] is equal to '0', then for each ind in the range of n, if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 equals 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] is equal to '1', `ok` is set to False. Additionally, `ret_gp` is incremented by the value returned by func_2(s).***
