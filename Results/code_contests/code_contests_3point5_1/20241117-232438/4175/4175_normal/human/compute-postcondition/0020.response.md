According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` remains True or False based on conditions, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s) under certain conditions, and `s` is a list containing values based on specific conditions.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be set to a value greater than or equal to -1 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True or False, `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1, `ret_gp` is updated with return values of func_2(s), `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0', `i` is greater than or equal to -1**
