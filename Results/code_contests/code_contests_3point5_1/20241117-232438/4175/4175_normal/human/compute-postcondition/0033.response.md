Output State: **After the loop executes, the value of `ok` will be False if the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2^ind] == '1') is met for any `ind` in the range of 0 to n-1. The loop will not execute if n is less than or equal to 0. In that case, the variables will retain their initial values.**
