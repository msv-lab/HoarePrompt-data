Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s. If s2[i] == '0' and certain conditions are met based on the loop iteration, `ok` is set to False; otherwise, `ok` remains True. `n` is a non-negative integer value converted from s1. `ret_gp` is updated with the return values of func_2(s) if the conditions are met. `s` is a list containing values incremented by 1 for each value from 0 to n-1 where the binary representation of the index i has a 1 bit in the corresponding position and s2[i] is equal to '0'.***
