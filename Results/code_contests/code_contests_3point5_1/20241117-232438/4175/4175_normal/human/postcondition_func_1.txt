The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, where `s` is a string. The function assigns the last character of the string `s` to the variable `v`. If the length of the string `pre_s` is 0, the function returns a list containing `v`. Otherwise, the function returns a list containing the last character of the string `s`, followed by the result of calling `func_2` on the string `pre_s`, then the result of calling `func_1` on the result of `func_2(pre_s)`, and finally the negative of the last character of the string `s`. It is important to note that there seems to be a typo in the call to `func_1` as it should be `func_2` instead.
