Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment as described in the problem. The program simply calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array and then adds 1 and divides by 2, which is not the correct approach. The expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment should be calculated based on the probabilities of choosing different segments.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The expected output should be 2.1666666666666665, but the program will output 2.5, which is incorrect.
