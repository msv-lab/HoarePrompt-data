Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, then reads a list of `n` integers. It calculates the number of unique integers in the list `arr`, increments this count by 1, and then attempts to divide this count by 2. However, the division operation is performed incorrectly as it is outside the print statement, which will lead to a syntax error. Additionally, there is a missing logic to handle the case when the input list is empty or when the input integers are not positive. **
