Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is now the input provided. The list `arr` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n positive integers**
