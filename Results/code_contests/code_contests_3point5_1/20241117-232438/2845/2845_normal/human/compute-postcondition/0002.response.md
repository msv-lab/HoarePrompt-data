Example Answer:
The variable `req` is assigned the length of the set of elements in the list `arr`. As `arr` is a list of n positive integers, taking the set of `arr` removes any duplicates, and then `req` is assigned the length of this set. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `req` is the number of unique elements in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `req` is the number of unique elements in `arr`**
