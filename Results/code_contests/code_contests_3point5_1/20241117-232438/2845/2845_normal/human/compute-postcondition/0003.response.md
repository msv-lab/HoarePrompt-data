Example Answer:
The code calculates `req + 1` and then divides the result by 2. The value of `req` represents the number of unique elements in the list `arr`, which is a list of `n` positive integers. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `req` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, and the result of the calculation `req + 1 / 2`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `req` is the number of unique elements in `arr`, and the result of the calculation `req + 1 / 2`**
