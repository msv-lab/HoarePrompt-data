Example Answer:
The `map` function converts each input value to an integer and assigns it to the list `arr`. The previous values of `n` and `arr` are positive integers. Therefore, after execution, `arr` will contain a list of positive integers entered as input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n positive integers**
