Correctness: **False**

The given code does not accurately calculate the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment as described in the problem statement. The code simply calculates the number of unique integers in the list `arr`, increments this count by 1, and then attempts to divide this count by 2. However, this approach does not consider all possible cases and does not accurately calculate the expected value.

The code is missing the logic to handle cases where the input list is empty or when the input integers are not positive. Additionally, the division operation is performed incorrectly as it is outside the print statement, which will lead to a syntax error. 

Hence, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
