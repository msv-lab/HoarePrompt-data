Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment of the array. It simply calculates the number of unique elements in the array and adds 1 to it, then divides the result by 2, which is not the expected calculation based on the problem description.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input
2
1 2

Expected Output
1.500000

Actual Output (from the program)
2.0

Explanation:
For the input [1, 2], the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment should be 1.5, as there are 2 elements in total with 1 unique element. However, the program incorrectly outputs 2.0. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
