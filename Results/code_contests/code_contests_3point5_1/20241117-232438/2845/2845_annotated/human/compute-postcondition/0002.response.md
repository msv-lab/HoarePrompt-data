Example Answer:
req is assigned the length of the set of arr, which removes any duplicate elements from the list. Since arr is a list of positive integers, set(arr) will contain unique positive integers only. Therefore, req will be the number of unique positive integers in the list arr. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of positive integers, req is the number of unique positive integers in arr**
