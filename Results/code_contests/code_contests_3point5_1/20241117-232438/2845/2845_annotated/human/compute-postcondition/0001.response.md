Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input from the user, splits it by spaces, converts each element into an integer, and stores them in the list arr. As n is not used in the code snippet, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of positive integers**
