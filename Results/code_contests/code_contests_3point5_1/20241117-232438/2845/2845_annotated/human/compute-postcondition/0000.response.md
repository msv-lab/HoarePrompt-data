Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer input using `raw_input()`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it will hold a valid value. The list `arr` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer and arr is a list of positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer and arr is a list of positive integers**
