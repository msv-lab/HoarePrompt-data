Example Answer:
If the first character in `S` is '0', `s0` will be increased by 1. If the first character in `S` is not '0', `s1` will be increased by 1. The value of `s0` or `s1` depends on the first character of `S`. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is not empty, `s0` and `s1` are integers based on the condition mentioned.
Output State: **`S` is not empty, `s0` and `s1` are integers based on the condition mentioned**
