Example Answer: 
`s1` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `s1` is unknown, the output state is: `S` has more characters left to process, updated `s0` or `s1` based on the condition, `s1` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`S` has more characters left to process, updated `s0` or `s1` based on the condition, `s1` is increased by 1**
