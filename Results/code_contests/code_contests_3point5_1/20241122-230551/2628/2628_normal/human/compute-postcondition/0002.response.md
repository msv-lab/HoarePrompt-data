According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `S`. To ensure the loop executes, `S` must not be empty. Initially, `s0` and `s1` are both 0. For the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `S` is not empty, and `c` is the first character in `S`.
State: **`S` is not empty, `s0` is 0, `s1` is 0, `c` is the first character in `S`**
