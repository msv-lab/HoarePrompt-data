Example Answer: 
Variables `s0` and `s1` are both assigned a value of 0. The previous values of both variables are unknown, so the output state is: S is a string consisting of only '0' and '1', `s0` and `s1` are both 0.
Output State: **S is a string consisting of only '0' and '1', `s0` and `s1` are both 0**
