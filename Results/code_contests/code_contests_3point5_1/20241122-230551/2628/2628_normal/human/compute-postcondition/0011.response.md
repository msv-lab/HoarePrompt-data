Postcondition: ***`S` is not empty, `s0` and `s1` are integers. If the first character in `S` is '0', `s0` is increased by 1 and `s1` remains 0. If the first character in `S` is not '0', `s1` is increased by 1 and `s0` remains 0. In all cases, either `s0` or `s1` is increased by 1 based on the condition, while the other variable remains unchanged.***
