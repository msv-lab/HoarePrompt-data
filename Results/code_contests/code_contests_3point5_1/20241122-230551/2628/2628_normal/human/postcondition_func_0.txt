The function takes user input as a string `S` consisting of only '0' and '1'. It then iterates through each character in `S`, counting the occurrences of '0' in `s0` and '1' in `s1`. After the loop, it prints the maximum count between `s0` and `s1`. If `S` is empty, both counts remain 0. The function does not return any value.
