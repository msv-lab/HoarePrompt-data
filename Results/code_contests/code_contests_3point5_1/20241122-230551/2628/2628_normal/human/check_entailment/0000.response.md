Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the input string `S`. It then prints the maximum count between `s0` and `s1`, which is the maximum integer K such that we can turn all the characters of S into `0` by repeating the operation some number of times. The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it accurately calculates the maximum integer K as required.
