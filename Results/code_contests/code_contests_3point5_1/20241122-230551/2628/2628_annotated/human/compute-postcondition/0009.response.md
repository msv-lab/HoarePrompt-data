Example Answer:
If the next character in `S` is '0', `s0` is incremented by 1. If the previous value of `s0` is k, then after execution, `s0` will be k+1, and `s1` will remain 0. If the next character in `S` is '1', `s0` remains the same, and `s1` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `s0` is incremented by 1, `s1` remains 0.
Output State: **`s0` is incremented by 1, `s1` remains 0**
