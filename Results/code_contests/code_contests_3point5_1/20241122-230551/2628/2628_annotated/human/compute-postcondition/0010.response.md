Example Answer: 
`s1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s1` is unknown. Since the code provided does not have any condition based on the next character in `S`, we cannot determine the exact values of `s0` and `s1`. Therefore, the output state is: `s0` is 0, `s1` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s0` is 0, `s1` is incremented by 1**
