Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the count of '0's and '1's in the input string `S` and then prints the maximum count between the two. This is in line with the problem description, as the maximum integer K required to turn all characters of `S` into '0' can be achieved by flipping the character with the maximum count. The program handles all potential cases correctly.
