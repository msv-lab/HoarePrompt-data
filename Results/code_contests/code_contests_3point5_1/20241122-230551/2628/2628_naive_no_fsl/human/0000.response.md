Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the maximum integer K by counting the number of '0's and '1's in the input string S and then taking the maximum of the two counts. This approach aligns with the problem description as the maximum integer K corresponds to the maximum count of either '0's or '1's in the string S. The program handles all potential cases and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
