**Precondition**: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 5000, and 1 <= k <= 100000. Each query input describes one of the following operations: 
- 1 ri ai (1 ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9), means that row ri is painted in color ai.
- 2 ci ai (1 ≤ ci ≤ m, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9), means that column ci is painted in color ai.
