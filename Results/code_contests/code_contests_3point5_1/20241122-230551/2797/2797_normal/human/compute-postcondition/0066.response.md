According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be at least 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`k` is at least 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values assigned based on the input.
