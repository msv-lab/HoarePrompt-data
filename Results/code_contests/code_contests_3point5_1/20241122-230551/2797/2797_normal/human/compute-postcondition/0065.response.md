Postcondition: ***`k` is decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values assigned based on the input. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is greater than 0 with `k` at least 0, the loop will execute `m` times. After the loop, `k` will be decreased by `m`, `a`, `b`, `c` will retain their assigned values, `i` will be `m-1`, and `l[b - 1][i]` will be assigned the value of `c`. If `m` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and `k` will remain decreased by 1. If `a` is not equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is decreased by 1, the loop will execute `n` times. After the loop, `k` will be decreased by `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` will retain their assigned values, `i` will be `n-1`, and `l[i][b - 1]` will be assigned the value of `c`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.***
