Example Answer:
The value of l at index (b-1, i) is assigned the value of c. The variables n, m, k remain unaffected. Since i is initially equal to m, the value of l at index (b-1, m) is assigned the value of c.
Output State: **n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000, i is m, l[b-1][m] = c**
