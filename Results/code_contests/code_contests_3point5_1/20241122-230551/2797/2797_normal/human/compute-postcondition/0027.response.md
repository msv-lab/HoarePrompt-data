According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n, m, and k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000. Since the loop is based on `m`, we need to adjust the state such that m is greater than 0. 
State: **n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000, m is greater than 0**
