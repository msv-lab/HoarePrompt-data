Postcondition: ***n, m, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n*m ≤ 100000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000. Each query description is either of the form "1 ri ai" where 1 ≤ ri ≤ n and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, or "2 ci ai" where 1 ≤ ci ≤ m and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; a 2D list l is created based on the values of n and m, with all elements initialized to 0; k is decreased by 1.***
