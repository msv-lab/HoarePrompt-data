Example Answer:
A 2D list `l` of size n x m is created, where each element is initialized to 0. The dimensions of the list are determined by the values of n and m. The previous values of n and m are used to create the list, and the elements are all set to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n*m ≤ 100000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000. Each query description is either of the form "1 ri ai" where 1 ≤ ri ≤ n and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, or "2 ci ai" where 1 ≤ ci ≤ m and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; a 2D list l is created based on the values of n and m, with all elements initialized to 0.
