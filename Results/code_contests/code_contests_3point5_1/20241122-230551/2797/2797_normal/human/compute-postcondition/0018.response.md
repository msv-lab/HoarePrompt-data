Example Answer: 
The element at index i and b-1 in the 2D list `l` is updated to the value of c. The index i is incremented by 1, but the previous values of n, m, k-1, and the 2D list `l` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, k-1 are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n*m ≤ 100000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000; 2D list `l` created based on the values of n and m with all elements initialized to 0, where the specific element at index i and b-1 is updated to the value of c, and i is incremented by 1.
