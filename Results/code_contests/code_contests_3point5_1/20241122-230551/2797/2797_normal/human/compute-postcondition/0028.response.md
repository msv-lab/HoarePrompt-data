Example Answer:
The value of `l` at index `b - 1` and index `i` is assigned the value of `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000, m is greater than 0.
Output State: **n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000, m is greater than 0**
