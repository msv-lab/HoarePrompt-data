Example Answer:
The value of the 2D list l at index (b - 1, i) is assigned the value of c. The variables n, m, and k are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000.
Output State: **n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000**
