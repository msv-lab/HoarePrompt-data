Example Answer:
The value of the element at index `[i][b - 1]` in the 2D list `l` is updated to the value of `c`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000, k is a positive integer, l is a 2D list based on n and m with some elements updated based on the assignment operation, i is less than n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000, k is a positive integer, l is a 2D list based on n and m with some elements updated based on the assignment operation, i is less than n**
