According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a 2D list based on n and m, and `i` is less than n + 1. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is incremented by 1.
State: **n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000, k is a positive integer, l is a 2D list based on n and m with some elements updated based on the assignment operation, i is less than n + 2**
