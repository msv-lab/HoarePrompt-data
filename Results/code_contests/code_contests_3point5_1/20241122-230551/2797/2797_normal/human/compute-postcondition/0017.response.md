According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `k-1` are positive integers meeting certain conditions, and 2D list `l` has been modified. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted. Since `i` is the loop variable, it needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n*m ≤ 100000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000; 2D list `l` created based on the values of n and m with all elements initialized to 0, where the specific element at index i and b-1 is updated to the value of c, `i` is incremented by 1**
