According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `m`, as it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000, i is m**
