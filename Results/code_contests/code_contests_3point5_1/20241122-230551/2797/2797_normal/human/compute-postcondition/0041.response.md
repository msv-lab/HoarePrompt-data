Example Answer:
The value at the ith row and (b-1)th column of the 2D list l is updated to c. The values of n, m, k, and the other elements of l remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000, k is a positive integer, l is a 2D list based on n and m with some elements updated based on the assignment operation, i is less than n + 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000, k is a positive integer, l is a 2D list based on n and m with some elements updated based on the assignment operation, i is less than n + 1**
