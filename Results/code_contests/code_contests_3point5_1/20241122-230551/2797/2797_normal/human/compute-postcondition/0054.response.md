According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values based on the input, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c. Since `i` is 2 and `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values based on the input, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c**.
