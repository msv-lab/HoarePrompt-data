According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0. Since `m` is greater than 0, it does not guarantee that the loop will execute again. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `m` should be greater than 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **n, m (greater than 1), k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000**
