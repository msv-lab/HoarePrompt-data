Example Answer:
The value at index i and b-1 in the 2D list l is assigned the value of c. The indices i and b-1 should be within the range of the dimensions of the list l. After execution, the specific element in the list l is updated to the value of c. Other variables and elements in the list remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n*m ≤ 100000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000; 2D list `l` created based on the values of n and m with all elements initialized to 0, where the specific element at index i and b-1 is updated to the value of c**
