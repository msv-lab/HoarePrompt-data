According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`. 
State: **n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000, i is 0, l[b-1][m] = c**
