Postcondition: ***n, m, k are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and n*m ≤ 100000. Each query description is either of the form "1 ri ai" where 1 ≤ ri ≤ n and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, or "2 ci ai" where 1 ≤ ci ≤ m and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9. A 2D list l is created based on the values of n and m, with all elements initialized to 0. If a == 1, for each valid index i < m, l[b - 1][i] is assigned the value of c; otherwise, for each valid index i < n, l[i][b - 1] is assigned the value of c. If n is less than 1, the loop doesn't execute, and no changes are made to the list l. If m is 0 or less, k is decreased by 1. After the loop execution, the 2D list l is updated based on n, m, and k-1. If n is less than 1, the loop doesn't execute, and no changes are made to the list l. If a == 1 and n is at least 1, m is at least 1, and k is a positive integer, the loop assigns the value of c to elements in the 2D list l based on the indices i and b-1 for m iterations. If a == 2 and n is at least 1, m is at least 1, and k is a positive integer, the loop assigns the value of c to elements in the 2D list l based on the indices i and b-1 for n iterations. The final state of l is updated based on the assignments, covering all edge cases and summarizing the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes.***
