Output State: **A 2D list `l` is created based on the values of `n` and `m`, with all elements initialized to 0; `k` is decreased by 2, `m` is greater than 0, value of `i` is less than `m`, value of `b` such that `l[b - 1][i]` is a valid assignment index, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`. If `m` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `k` is decreased by 1.**
