Example Answer:
The variables a, b, and c are assigned values by mapping integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of a, b, and c are dependent on the input provided. The variable k is decreased by 1, but the impact of this change is not reflected in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: k is decreased by 1, and a, b, c are assigned values based on the input.
Output State: **k is decreased by 1, and a, b, c are assigned values based on the input**
