The function `func` reads input values for n, m, k and initializes a 2D list l with dimensions n x m. It then processes k queries of the form "1 ri ai" or "2 ci ai", updating the elements of list l accordingly. If a query is of type 1, it updates elements in row (ri-1) of list l with the value ai. If a query is of type 2, it updates elements in column (ci-1) of list l with the value ai. The function does not return any value but prints the final state of list l after processing all queries. The loop executes up to k times if k is greater than 0. If n or m is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and the list l remains unchanged.
