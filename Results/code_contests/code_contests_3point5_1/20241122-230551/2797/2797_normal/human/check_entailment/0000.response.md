Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code initializes a 2D list representing the sheet of paper with all cells painted in color 0.
- It then processes k queries, where each query either paints a row or a column with a specific color.
- If the query is of type 1, it updates the elements in the specified row with the given color.
- If the query is of type 2, it updates the elements in the specified column with the given color.
- The code prints the final state of the sheet after processing all queries.

The code seems to correctly implement the operations described in the problem statement. It updates the cells in the rows and columns as specified by the queries, and prints the final result accordingly. There are no apparent edge cases that the code does not handle based on the problem description.
