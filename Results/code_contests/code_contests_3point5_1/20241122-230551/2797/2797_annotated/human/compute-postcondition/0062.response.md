Example Answer:
The value `c` is assigned to the element in the 2D list `l` at index `i` and `b - 1`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k` remain unchanged, and `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `i` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `i` is less than `n**
