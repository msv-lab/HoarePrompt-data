According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `l` is a 2D list where if `a` is not equal to 1, `c` is assigned to the element at index `[i][b - 1]` in `l` for `n` times. `k` is decreased by 1, `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`**
