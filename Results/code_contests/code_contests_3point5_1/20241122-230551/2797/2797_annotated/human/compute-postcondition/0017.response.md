According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list with the value of `c` assigned to element at index `[i][b - 1]`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. The value of `a` is not equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list with the value of `c` assigned to element at index `[i + 1][b - 1]`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. The value of `a` is not equal to 1**
