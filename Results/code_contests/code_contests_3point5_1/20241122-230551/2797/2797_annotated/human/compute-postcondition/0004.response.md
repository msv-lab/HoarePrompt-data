Example Answer:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input split by spaces. The initial conditions state that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `l` is a 2D list filled with zeros, so they remain unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying the conditions, `l` is a 2D list filled with zeros; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying the conditions, `l` is a 2D list filled with zeros; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned input integers**
