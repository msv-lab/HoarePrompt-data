Postcondition: ***n, m, k are positive integers. a, b, c are input integers where a is not equal to 1. k is decremented by 1. l is a 2D list with specific elements updated to the value of c based on the conditions of the if-else block. If a is not equal to 1, c is assigned to the element at index [i][b - 1] in l for n times***
