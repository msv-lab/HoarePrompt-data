Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `l` is a 2D list where if a == 1, `c` is assigned to each element in the `b-1` row of `l` for `m` times. If a is not equal to 1, `c` is assigned to the element at index `[i][b - 1]` in `l` for `n` times. If m < 1, the loop for the if part does not execute. If n = 0, the loop for the else part does not execute. In each iteration of the loop, k is decremented by 1. After the loops execute, the elements in the respective rows/columns are updated as described. If n = 0 or a = 1, the loop for the else part does not execute.***
