According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i]`, `i` is less than `m+1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i+1]`, `i` is less than `m+1`**
