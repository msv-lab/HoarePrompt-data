According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, and the value `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i]`. Since `i` is the looping variable and it increments by 1 in each iteration, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `m+1` for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, and the value `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i]`, `i` is less than `m+1`**
