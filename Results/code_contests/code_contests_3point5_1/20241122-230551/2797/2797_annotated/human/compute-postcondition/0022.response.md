Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `n` times, assigning the value of `c` to the element at index `[i][b - 1]` in the 2D list `l`. If `n` is 0, the loop won't execute. After the loop, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers; `l` is a 2D list with the values of `c` assigned to specific elements based on the loop; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers where the value of `a` is not equal to 1.**
