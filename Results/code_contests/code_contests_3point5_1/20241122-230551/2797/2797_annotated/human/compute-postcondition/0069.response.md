The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined constraints and relationships between positive integers n, m, and k. Each query input is in the format of "1 ri ai" or "2 ci ai" where 1 <= ri <= n, 1 <= ci <= m, and 1 <= ai <= 10^9. The function does not return any specific value.
