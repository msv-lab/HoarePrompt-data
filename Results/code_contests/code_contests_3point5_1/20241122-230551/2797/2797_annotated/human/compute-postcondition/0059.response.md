According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. If `a` is not equal to 1, `c` is assigned to the element at index `[i][b - 1]` in `l` for `n` times. `k` is decreased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` ranges from 0 to `n`.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `i` ranges from 0 to `n`.**
