Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying the conditions. `l` is a 2D list with specific elements updated to the value of `c` based on the conditions of the if-else block. If `a` is equal to 1, `c` is assigned to each element in the `b-1` row of `l` for `m` times, otherwise `c` is assigned to the element at index `[i][b - 1]` in `l` for `n` times. If `m` is less than 1, the loop for the if part does not execute, and if `n` is 0, the loop for the else part does not execute. `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers where `a` is not equal to 1.***
