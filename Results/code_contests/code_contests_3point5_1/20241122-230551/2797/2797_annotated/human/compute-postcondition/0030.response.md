Example Answer:
The value `c` is assigned to the element at index `i` of the sublist at index `b - 1` in the list `l`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1, `m` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1, `m` is incremented by 1**
