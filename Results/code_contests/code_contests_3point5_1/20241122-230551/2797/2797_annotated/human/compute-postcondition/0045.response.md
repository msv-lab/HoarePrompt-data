According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. In each iteration of the loop, `k` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `l` is a 2D list where if a == 1, `c` is assigned to each element in the `b-1` row of `l` for `m` times. If a is not equal to 1, `c` is assigned to the element at index `[i][b - 1]` in `l` for `n` times.**
