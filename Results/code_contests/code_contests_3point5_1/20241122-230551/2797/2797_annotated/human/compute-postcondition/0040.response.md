According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0, k is decremented by 1, a is not equal to 1, c is assigned to l[i][b - 1], b is a valid index within l, i is less than n. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1, so the state that needs adjustment is `i is less than or equal to n`.
State: **n is greater than 0, k is decremented by 1, a is not equal to 1, c is assigned to l[i][b - 1], b is a valid index within l, i is less than or equal to n**
