Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for positive integers n, m, and k. It then creates a 2D list `l` of size n x m initialized with zeros. The function processes queries in the format "1 ri ai" or "2 ci ai" where 1 <= ri <= n, 1 <= ci <= m, and 1 <= ai <= 10^9. For each query, if a is 1, it updates the elements in the (b-1)th row of l to c, and if a is not 1, it updates the elements in the (b-1)th column of l to c. The function does not return any specific value and prints the updated 2D list `l` at the end.**
