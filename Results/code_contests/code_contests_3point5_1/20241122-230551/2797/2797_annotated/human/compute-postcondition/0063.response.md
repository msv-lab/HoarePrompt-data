According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `i` is less than `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `i` is less than `n+1**
