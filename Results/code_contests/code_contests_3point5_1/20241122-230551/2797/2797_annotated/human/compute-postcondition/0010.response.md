According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a positive integer satisfying the conditions, `l` is a 2D list filled with zeros, `a` is assigned input integer and equal to 1, `b` and `c` are assigned input integers, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`**
