Since the loop is for `m` times, the loop will always execute as long as `m` is a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `m` is a positive integer. Additionally, `k` is decremented by 1 after the loop, so we need to adjust `k` accordingly.

State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1**
