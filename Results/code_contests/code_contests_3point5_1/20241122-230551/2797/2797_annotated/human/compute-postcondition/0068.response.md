Output State: **If k is greater than 0, the loop will iterate at least once. Depending on the value of a, either the elements in the (b-1) row or column of l will be updated to c for m or n times, respectively. If a is not equal to 1, the loop for the if part will not execute. If m is less than 1, the loop for the if part will not execute. If n is 0, the loop for the else part will not execute. After the loop finishes, the values of n, m, and k will remain positive integers.**
