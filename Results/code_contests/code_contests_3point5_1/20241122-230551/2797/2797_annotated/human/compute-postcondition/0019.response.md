According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list with the value of `c` assigned to element at index `[i + 1][b - 1]`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers; value of `a` is not equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list with the value of `c` assigned to element at index `[i + 2][b - 1]`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers; value of `a` is not equal to 1**
