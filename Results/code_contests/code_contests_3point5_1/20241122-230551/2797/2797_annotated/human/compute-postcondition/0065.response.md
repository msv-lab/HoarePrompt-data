Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. If a == 1 and m > 0, c is assigned to each element in the (b-1) row of l for m times. k is decreased by 1. If m <= 0, no assignment is made, and the initial state is preserved. If a != 1 and n > 0, c is assigned to the element at index [i][b - 1] in l for n times. k is decreased by 1, i ranges from 0 to n-1. If n < 1, no assignment is made, and the initial state is preserved.***
