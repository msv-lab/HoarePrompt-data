Example Answer:
The value `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1, `m` is incremented by 2, and the value `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1, `m` is incremented by 2, and the value `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i]`**
