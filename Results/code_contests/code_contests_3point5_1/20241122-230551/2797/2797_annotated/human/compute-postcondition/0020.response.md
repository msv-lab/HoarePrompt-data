Example Answer:
The value of `c` is assigned to the element at index `[i + 2][b - 1]` of the 2D list `l`. The values of `i` and `b` are unknown, but the value of `c` is known as an input integer. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list with the value of `c` assigned to element at index `[i + 2][b - 1]`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers; value of `a` is not equal to 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list with the value of `c` assigned to element at index `[i + 2][b - 1]`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers; value of `a` is not equal to 1**
