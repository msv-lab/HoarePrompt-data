Example Answer:
The value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `i` ranges from 0 to `n`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `i` ranges from 0 to `n`**
