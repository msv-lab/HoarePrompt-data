According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, and `i` ranges from 0 to `n`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be less than `n`. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `i` is less than `n`**
