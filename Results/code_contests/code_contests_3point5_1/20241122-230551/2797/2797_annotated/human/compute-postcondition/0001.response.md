Example Answer:
A 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns filled with zeros. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `l` is a 2D list filled with zeros.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `l` is a 2D list filled with zeros**
