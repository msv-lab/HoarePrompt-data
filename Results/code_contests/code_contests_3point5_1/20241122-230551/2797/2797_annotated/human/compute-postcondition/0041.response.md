Example Answer:
The value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, k is decremented by 1, a is not equal to 1, c is assigned to l[i][b - 1], b is a valid index within l, i is less than or equal to n.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is decremented by 1, a is not equal to 1, c is assigned to l[i][b - 1], b is a valid index within l, i is less than or equal to n**
