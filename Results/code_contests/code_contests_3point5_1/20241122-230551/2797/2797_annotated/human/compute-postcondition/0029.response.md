According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m` are positive integers, and `k` is decremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `m` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1, `m` is incremented by 1**
