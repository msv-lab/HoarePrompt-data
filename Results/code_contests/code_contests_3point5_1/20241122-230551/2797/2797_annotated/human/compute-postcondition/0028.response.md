Example Answer:
The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1**
