According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1, `m` is incremented by 2, and the value `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` needs to be adjusted to `m + 1` since `i` is zero-based index and it should be less than `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m + 1` are positive integers, `k` is decremented by 1, `m` is incremented by 2, and the value `c` is assigned to `l[b - 1][i]**
