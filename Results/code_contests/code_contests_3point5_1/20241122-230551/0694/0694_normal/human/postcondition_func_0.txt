The function `func` continuously prompts the user to input two integers, `h` and `w`, until both `h` and `w` are entered as 0. If either `h` or `w` is less than or equal to 1, the loop won't execute. For each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, '#' is printed; otherwise, '.' is printed. The function does not explicitly return any value.
