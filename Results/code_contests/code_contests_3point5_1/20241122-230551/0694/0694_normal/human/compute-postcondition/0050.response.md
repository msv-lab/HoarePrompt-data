Postcondition: ***`w` is greater than 0, `h` has a previous value, `j` is incremented by 1. If i equals 0 or j equals 0 or i equals h - 1 or j equals w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. The program ensures that proper characters are printed based on the conditions of i, j, w, and h, covering all edge cases and incrementing j by 1.***
