According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is less than w. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, j is 2, and w is greater than 0. This means the loop can execute one more time. In order to do so, j needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300, 3 <= W <= 300. h is an integer between 1 and 300, w is an integer between 3 and 300. i is 1, j is 3, and w is greater than 0**
