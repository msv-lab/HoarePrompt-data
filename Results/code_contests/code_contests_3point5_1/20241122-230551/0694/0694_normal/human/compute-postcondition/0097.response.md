According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `h`, `j`, `w` are integers. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is h - 1 or `j` is w - 1, the code prints '#'. Otherwise, the code prints '.'. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `h`, `j`, `w` are integers with `j` less than `w`**
