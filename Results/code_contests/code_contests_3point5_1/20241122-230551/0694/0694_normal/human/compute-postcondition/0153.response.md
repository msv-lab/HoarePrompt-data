According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w`, `i`, and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is less than `w`. Since `j` is less than `w`, it meets the condition for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is less than `w`**
