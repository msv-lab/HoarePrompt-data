According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range `w` is greater than 0. The loop will iterate `w` times starting from 0. Before the loop starts, the initial state should be adjusted so that `w` is greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes. Additionally, `j` should be set to 0 to represent the starting point of the loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0**
