Example Answer:
The values of `h` and `w` are assigned by mapping the integer inputs from the user. The values of `h` and `w` will depend on the user input, so the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: the values of `h` and `w` depend on the user input.
Output State: **the values of `h` and `w` depend on the user input**
