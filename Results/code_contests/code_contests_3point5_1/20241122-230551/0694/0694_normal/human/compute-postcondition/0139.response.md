According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `j` are integers greater than 0, and `j` is less than `w`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`**
