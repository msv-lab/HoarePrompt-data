According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w`, `h`, `i`, and `j`. At the end of the previous iteration, `w` is greater than 0, and `h` has a previous value. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and not `h - 1`, and `j` is not 0 and not `w - 1`, the program prints '.'.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `j` value needs to be adjusted. Since the loop is iterating over the range from 0 to `w`, the next iteration should have `j` incremented by 1.

State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` has a previous value, `j` is incremented by 1**
