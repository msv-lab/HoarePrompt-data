According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are positive integers, `j` is less than `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` and `w` are positive integers, `j` is less than `w**
