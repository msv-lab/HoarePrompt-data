According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. In this case, `w` is 0 which means the loop will not execute as the range is from 0 to 0. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `w` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0**
