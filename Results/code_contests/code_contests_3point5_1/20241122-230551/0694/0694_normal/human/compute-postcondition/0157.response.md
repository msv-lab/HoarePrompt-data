According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is less than `w`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `w-1` as the loop goes up to, but does not include, `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is `w-1`**
