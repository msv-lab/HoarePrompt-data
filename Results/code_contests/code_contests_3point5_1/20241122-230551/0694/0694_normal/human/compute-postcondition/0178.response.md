According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w` and `h`. If `w` is greater than 1, the loop will execute `w` times. At the end of the last iteration, `w` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `w` is greater than 1, `i` and `j` remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.**
