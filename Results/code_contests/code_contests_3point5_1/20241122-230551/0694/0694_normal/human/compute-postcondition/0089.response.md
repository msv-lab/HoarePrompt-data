According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` should be less than `w`.
State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, `w` is greater than 0**
