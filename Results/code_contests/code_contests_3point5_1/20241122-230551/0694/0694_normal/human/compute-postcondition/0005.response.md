According to the code, the loop will always execute since the range is specified from 0 to `w`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `H` and `W` remain the same, `h` remains the same, `w` remains the same, and `i` remains the same.
State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 <= H <= 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 <= W <= 300; `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0**
