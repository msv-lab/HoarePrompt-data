According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `h` has a previous value, `j` is less than `w`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` has a previous value, `j` is less than `w + 1**
