Postcondition: ***`i`, `h`, `j`, `w` are integers. If `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0, and either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. All conditions regarding `i` and `j` are considered, ensuring that the program handles all possible edge cases.***
