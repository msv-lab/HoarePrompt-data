According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are positive integers. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. Since the loop is based on `j` and `w`, only `j` needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. 
State: **`h` and `w` are positive integers, `j` is less than `w`**
