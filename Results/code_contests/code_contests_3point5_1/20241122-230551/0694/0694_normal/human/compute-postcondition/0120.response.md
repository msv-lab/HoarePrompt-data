Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely until explicitly stopped. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are based on the conditions within the loop body.

For the program to execute one more time, the conditions within the loop body need to be met. The loop prints '#' if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. Otherwise, it prints '.'.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, no adjustments to the states are necessary as the loop will continue indefinitely.

Output State: **No adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time**.
