According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of 0 to `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2 to stay within the range. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2**
