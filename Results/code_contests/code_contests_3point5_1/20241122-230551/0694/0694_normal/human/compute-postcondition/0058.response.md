According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `i` from 0 to `h-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0 and `h` has the same value as the previous iteration. To execute one more time, the loop needs to increment `h` by 1 to move to the next iteration.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` has increased by 1**
