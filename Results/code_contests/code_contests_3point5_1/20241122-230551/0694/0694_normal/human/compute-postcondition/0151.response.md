Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints a period "." to the console. There is no change in the state of variables `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is greater than 0, `i` and `j` are integers, where `j` is less than `w`.
Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `i` and `j` are integers, where `j` is less than `w`**
