Output State: **If `h` is less than or equal to 1 or `w` is less than or equal to 1, the loop won't execute. If `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0, and either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'.**
