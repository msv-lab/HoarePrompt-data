Postcondition: ***`w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If either i is 0, j is 0, i is h - 1, or j is w - 1, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, when i is not equal to 0, j is not equal to 0, i is not equal to h - 1, and j is not equal to w - 1, the program prints '.'. This covers all possible scenarios for the given program fragment.***
