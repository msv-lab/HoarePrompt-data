According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `H` and `W` are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300, 3 <= W <= 300; `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 <= H <= 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 <= W <= 300; `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
