According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` being greater than 0 is not directly related to the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0**
