The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that `H` and `W` are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300. The function does not return any value explicitly. 

Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that `H` and `W` are integers within the range 3 to 300. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
