Postcondition: ***`w` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is less than `w`. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is h - 1 or `j` is w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. This covers all possible cases where the program will print either '#' or '.' based on the conditions of `i` and `j` relative to `w` and `h`.***
