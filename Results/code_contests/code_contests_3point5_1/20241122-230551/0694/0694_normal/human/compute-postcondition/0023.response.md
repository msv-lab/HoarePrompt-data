According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. Therefore, before the loop starts the following states need to be adjusted: `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0.
State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 <= H <= 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0**
