According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 1. No other information is provided about the values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 1**
