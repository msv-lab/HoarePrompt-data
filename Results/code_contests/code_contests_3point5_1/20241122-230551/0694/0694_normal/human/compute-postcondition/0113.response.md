Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('.')` simply prints a period "." to the console. The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` and `w` are integers greater than 1, `j` is less than `w`.
Output State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 1, `j` is less than `w`**
