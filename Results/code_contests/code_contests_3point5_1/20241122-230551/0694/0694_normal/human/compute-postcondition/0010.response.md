Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that 3 <= H <= 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 <= W <= 300; `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is h - 1 or `j` is w - 1, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'.***
