Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` has the same value as the previous iteration. The loop iterates through all values of `j` from 0 to `w-1`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h-1`, or `j` is `w-1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. The loop ensures proper characters are printed based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, `w`, and `h`. If `w` is 0 or `h` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed.**
