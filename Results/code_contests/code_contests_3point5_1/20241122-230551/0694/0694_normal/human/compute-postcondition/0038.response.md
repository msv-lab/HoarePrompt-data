Output State: 

The loop iterates through the range of columns in the grid. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, the character '.' is printed.

If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed. 

If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, printing characters based on the conditions mentioned above.

**If w is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If w is greater than 0, the loop prints characters '#' or '.' based on the conditions mentioned above.**
