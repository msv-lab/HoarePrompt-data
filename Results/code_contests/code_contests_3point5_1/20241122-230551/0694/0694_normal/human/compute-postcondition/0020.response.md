Output State: **The loop iterates through each column of a grid with dimensions H x W. If the current position is on the border of the grid (i=0 or j=0 or i=h-1 or j=w-1), then the program prints '#', otherwise it prints '.'. After the loop executes, `H` is an integer such that 3 <= H <= 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to the number of columns in the grid. If either `h` is less than 3, `w` is less than 3, or if `i` is not equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and the program does not print anything.**
