According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `H` and `W` remain the same, `h` and `w` remain the same, `i` is 0, and `j` is the previous value incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `w`, so `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 <= H <= 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 <= W <= 300; `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
