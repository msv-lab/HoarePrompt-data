Since there is no output as there is no code to execute, we need to determine the initial state for the first iteration of the loop. 

In the case of the given code snippet:
```
for i in range(0, h):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. Since there is no previous iteration state provided, we need to set the initial state for the first iteration. In this case, since `i` starts from 0 and the loop will execute while `i` is less than `h`, the initial state for the first iteration would be:
State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0**
