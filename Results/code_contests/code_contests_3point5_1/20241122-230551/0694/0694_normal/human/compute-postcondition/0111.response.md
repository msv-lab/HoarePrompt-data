According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 1. If either `i` or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the code prints '#' indicating a boundary case. Otherwise, the code prints '.' indicating a non-boundary case. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `w`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 1, `j` is less than `w`**
