According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `h` has a previous value, and `j` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` has a previous value, `j` is less than w**
