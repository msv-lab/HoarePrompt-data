According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value, which is 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
