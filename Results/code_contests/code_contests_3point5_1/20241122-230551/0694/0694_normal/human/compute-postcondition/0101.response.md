According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 1. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute, `w` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1. Additionally, since the loop won't execute if `h` is less than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `h` is greater than 1 as well.
State: **Output State: `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 1**
