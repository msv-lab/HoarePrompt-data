Output State: **If either H or W is less than or equal to 1, the loop won't execute. The loop will continue to execute until h and w are entered as 0. During each iteration, if i is 0, j is 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. After the loop execution, i is 0, j is 0. If h is 0, the loop does not execute at all.**
