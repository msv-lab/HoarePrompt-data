According to the code, the loop will execute `h` number of times. Since the loop did not execute in the previous iteration due to `w` being 0, we can conclude that `w` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: No characters are printed as the loop does not execute due to `w` being 0.**
