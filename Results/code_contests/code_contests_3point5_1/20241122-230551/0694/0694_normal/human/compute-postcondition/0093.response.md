According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`, and `w` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `w + 1`, `w` is greater than 0**
