Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a '.' to the console but does not affect the variables `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state is `w` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is less than `w`.
Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is less than `w`**
