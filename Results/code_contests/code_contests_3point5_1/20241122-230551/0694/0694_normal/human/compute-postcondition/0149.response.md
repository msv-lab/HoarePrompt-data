According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `i` and `j` are integers, where `j` is less than `w`**
