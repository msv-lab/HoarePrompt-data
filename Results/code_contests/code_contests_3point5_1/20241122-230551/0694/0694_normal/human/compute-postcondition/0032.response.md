Postcondition: ***H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300, 3 <= W <= 300. h is an integer between 1 and 300, w is an integer between 3 and 300. i is 1, j is 1, and w is greater than 0. If i equals 0 or j equals 0 or i equals h - 1 or j equals w - 1, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.' in all other cases.***
