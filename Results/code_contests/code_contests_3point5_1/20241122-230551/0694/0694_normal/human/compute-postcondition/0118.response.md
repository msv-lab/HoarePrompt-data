According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `w`. If `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is `h`, `w` is `w`, `i` is `h - 1`, and `j` is `w - 1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`, and `j` needs to be adjusted to 0.
State: **`h` is `h`, `w` is `w`, `i` is `h`, `j` is 0**
