According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w` and `h`. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is less than or equal to 0. This means the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `w` needs to be adjusted to `w` is greater than 0.
State: **If w is greater than 0, `h` is the same as the previous iteration**
