According to the code, the loop can execute if `h` is greater than 0. Since the loop range is from 0 to `h`, `h` must be at least 1 for the loop to run. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `h` is greater than 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` are user input values. If `h` is equal to 0 and `w` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
