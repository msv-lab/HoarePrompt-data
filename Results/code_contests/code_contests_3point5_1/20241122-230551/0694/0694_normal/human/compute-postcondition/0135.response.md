According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `j` are integers greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` should be less than `w`.
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`**
