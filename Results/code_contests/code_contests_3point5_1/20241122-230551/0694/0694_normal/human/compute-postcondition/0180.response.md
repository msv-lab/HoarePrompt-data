According to the code, the loop will execute `w` times if `w` is greater than 0. During each iteration, certain conditions need to be met for either '#' or '.' to be printed. At the end of the loop execution, `i` is `h - 1` and `j` is `w - 1`.

Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will certainly execute one more time. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `w` needs to be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` needs to be 0 for '#' to be printed in the next iteration.
- `j` needs to be 0 for '#' to be printed in the next iteration.
- `i` needs to be `h - 1` at the end of the loop execution.
- `j` needs to be `w - 1` at the end of the loop execution.

State: **`w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, and `j` is `w - 1`**
