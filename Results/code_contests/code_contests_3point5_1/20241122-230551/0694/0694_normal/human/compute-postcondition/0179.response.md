Output State: If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times. During each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. After the loop execution, `i` is `h - 1` and `j` is `w - 1`. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed. If `h` is 0, the loop does not execute at all.
