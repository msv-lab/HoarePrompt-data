Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that 3 <= H <= 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 <= W <= 300; `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is h - 1, or `j` is w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed.***
