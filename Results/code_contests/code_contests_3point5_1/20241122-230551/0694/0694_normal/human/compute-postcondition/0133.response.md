Example Answer:
The code simply prints a period '.' to the output. It does not affect the initial state of the variables `h`, `w`, or `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`.
Output State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`**
