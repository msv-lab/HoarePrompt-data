Example Answer:
`h` and `w` are assigned the values from the input after splitting by spaces. The values of `H` and `W` are between 3 and 300, so `h` and `w` will also fall within the same range. Therefore, the Output State is: H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300; h and w are integers within the same range.
Output State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300; h and w are integers within the same range**
