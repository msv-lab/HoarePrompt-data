According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are positive integers, and `j` is less than `w`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`h` and `w` are positive integers, `j` is less than `w + 1**
