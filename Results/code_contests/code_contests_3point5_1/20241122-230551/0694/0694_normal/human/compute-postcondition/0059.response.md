Output State: **After the loop executes, the program prints a grid of characters '#' and '.' based on the conditions mentioned in the loop. If either `h` or `w` is 0, the loop does not execute. The values of `H`, `W`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` depend on the number of iterations and the conditions met within the loop.**
