Postcondition: ***H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300, 3 <= W <= 300. h is an integer between 1 and 300, w is an integer between 3 and 300. i is 1, j is 0, and w is greater than 0. If i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, the character '.' is printed.***
