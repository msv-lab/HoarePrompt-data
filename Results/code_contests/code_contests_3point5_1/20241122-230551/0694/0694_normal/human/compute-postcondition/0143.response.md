According to the code, the loop will only execute if `w` is greater than 0. Since the output states that no characters are printed due to `w` being 0, we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, to make the loop execute, `w` should be greater than 0.
State: **`w` is greater than 0**
