According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. Since `h` is the same as the previous iteration, it implies that `h` has a previous value. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0 and `h` must have a previous value.
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` has a previous value**
