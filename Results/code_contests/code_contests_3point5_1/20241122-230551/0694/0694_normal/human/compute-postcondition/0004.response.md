According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `h`. If h is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, h is equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than or equal to 1. Also, since i starts at 0, the state needs to be updated to reflect that.
State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300; `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0**
