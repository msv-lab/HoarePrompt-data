According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300. Since `j` is 2 and the loop can execute again, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 at the start of the next iteration.
State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 <= H <= 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 <= W <= 300; `h` is an integer between 1 and 300, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
