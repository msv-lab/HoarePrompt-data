According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 1, `j` is less than `w`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w - 1`.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 1, `j` is less than `w - 1**
