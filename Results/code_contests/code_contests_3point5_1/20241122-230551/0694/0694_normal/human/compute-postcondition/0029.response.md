According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is less than w. At the end of the previous iteration, i is 1, j is 0, and w is greater than 0. Since j is less than w, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is j. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300, 3 <= W <= 300. h is an integer between 1 and 300, w is an integer between 3 and 300. i is 1, j is 1, and w is greater than 0**.
