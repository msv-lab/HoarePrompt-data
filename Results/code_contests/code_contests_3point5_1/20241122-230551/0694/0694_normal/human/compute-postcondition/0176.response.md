Output State: **If `w` is greater than 1, the loop will iterate `w` times. At each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. The values of `j` will range from 0 to `w - 1` after the loop executes. If `w` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `i` and `j` remain 0.**
