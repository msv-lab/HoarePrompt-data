According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w` and `i` needs to remain unchanged. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is 1**
