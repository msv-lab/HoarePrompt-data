According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is between 0 and `w`, and `i` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is between 0 and `w`, `i` is incremented by 1**
