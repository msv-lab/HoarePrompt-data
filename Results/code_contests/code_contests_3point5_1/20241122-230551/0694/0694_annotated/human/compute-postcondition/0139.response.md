According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `j` are integers where `h` and `w` are greater than 0, and `j` is less than `w + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` are integers where `h` and `w` are greater than 0, and `j` is less than `w + 1**
