According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `w` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `h` and `w` being integers greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `h` and `w` need to be greater than 0 and `i` is less than `h`, as well as `j` is now 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0**
