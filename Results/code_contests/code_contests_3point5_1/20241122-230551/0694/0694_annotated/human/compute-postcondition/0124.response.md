According to the code, the loop will only execute if `h` is greater than 0. In this case, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Since `w` does not affect the loop execution directly, we only need to focus on `h`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is input integer**
