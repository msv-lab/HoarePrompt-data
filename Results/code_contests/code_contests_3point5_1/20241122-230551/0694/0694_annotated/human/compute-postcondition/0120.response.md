According to the code, the loop will always execute as it is a `while True` loop. The conditions for printing '#' are when `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, otherwise it prints '.'. After the loop execution, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `h - 1`, and `j` is between 0 and `w - 1`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be set to 0 or `i` needs to be incremented to reach `h - 1`.
- `j` needs to be set to 0 or `j` needs to be incremented to reach `w - 1`.

State: **After adjusting the states accordingly based on the above conditions**.
