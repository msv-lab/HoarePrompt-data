According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `h` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` is an integer between 3 and 300, but it does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop will execute, `h` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0**
