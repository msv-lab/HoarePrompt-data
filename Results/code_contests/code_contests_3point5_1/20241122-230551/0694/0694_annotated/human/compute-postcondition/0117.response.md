Output State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w - 1`, `i` is less than `h - 1. If either i is 0, j is 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. If h is 0 or w is 0 the loop does not execute and no output is generated.**
