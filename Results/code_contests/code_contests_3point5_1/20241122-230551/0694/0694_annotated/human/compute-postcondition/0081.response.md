Output State: **After the loop execution, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` reaches the value of `w - 1`. The program prints '#' if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no output is generated.**
