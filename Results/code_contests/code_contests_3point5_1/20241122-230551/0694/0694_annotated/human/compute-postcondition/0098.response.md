Output State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is between 0 and `w-1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the code prints '#'. Otherwise, the code prints '.'. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.**
