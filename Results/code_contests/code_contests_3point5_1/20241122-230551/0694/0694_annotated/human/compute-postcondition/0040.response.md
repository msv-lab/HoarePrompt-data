According to the code, the loop executes `w` times, not executing if `w` is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value.

State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is one more than the previous value**
