According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, `j` is 1**
