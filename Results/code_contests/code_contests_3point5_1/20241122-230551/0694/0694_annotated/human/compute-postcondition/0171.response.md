According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, `j` is 1. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`, so `j` needs to be adjusted. The next value of `j` should be the current value of `j` plus 1.

State: **`h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, `j` is 2**
