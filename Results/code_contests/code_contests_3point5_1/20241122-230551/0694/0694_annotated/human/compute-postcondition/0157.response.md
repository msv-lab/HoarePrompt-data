According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is an integer less than `h`, and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `j`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`h`, `w` are positive integers, `i` is an integer less than `h`, `j` is 3**
