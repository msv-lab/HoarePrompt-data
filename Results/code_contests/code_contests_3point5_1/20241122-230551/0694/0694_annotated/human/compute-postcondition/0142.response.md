According to the code, the loop can execute if `w` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `h`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, `#` is printed; otherwise, `.` is printed.
At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `h`.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`**
