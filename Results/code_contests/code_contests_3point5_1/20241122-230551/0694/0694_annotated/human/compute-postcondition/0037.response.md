According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is 1**
