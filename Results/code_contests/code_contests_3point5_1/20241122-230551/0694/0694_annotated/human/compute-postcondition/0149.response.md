According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `w-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w` are positive integers, `i` is an integer less than `h`, `j` is 0. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'.

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `j` is incremented to the next value. Since the loop iterates over the values of `j` from 0 to `w-1`, the next value of `j` should be 1 more than the current value.

State: **`h`, `w` are positive integers, `i` is an integer less than `h`, `j` is 1**
