According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `w` is at least 1. The loop will iterate over values of `j` from 0 to `w-1`. Before the loop starts, `j` is between 0 and `w-1` ensures that the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w-1`, and `i` is less than `h-1`.
State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w-1`, `i` is less than `h - 1**
