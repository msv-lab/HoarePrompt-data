According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` is greater than 0 does not impact the loop execution. So, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0**
