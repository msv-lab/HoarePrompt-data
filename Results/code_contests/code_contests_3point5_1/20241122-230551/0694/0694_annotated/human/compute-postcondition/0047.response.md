According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of 0 to `w` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and `i` is one more than the previous value. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `i` is one more than the previous value**
