According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are positive integers. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w-1` to satisfy the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are positive integers where `j` is less than `w-1**
