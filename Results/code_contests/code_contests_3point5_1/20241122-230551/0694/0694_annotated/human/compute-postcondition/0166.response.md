Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and iterates up to (w-1). If i is 0 or j is 0 or i is equal to h - 1 or j is equal to w - 1, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, when none of the conditions (i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1) are met, the program prints '.'. This behavior covers all possible cases of the if-else block.***
