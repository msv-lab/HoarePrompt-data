Since the loop is iterating over the range from 0 to `w`, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `w - 1` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w - 1`, `i` is less than `h - 1**
