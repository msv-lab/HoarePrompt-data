According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w`, `h`, and `i`. If `w` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute `w` times. After the loop executes, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `i` is one more than the previous value. The program prints '#' if either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`; otherwise, it prints '.'. If `w` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
Output State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is one more than the previous value**

State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is one more than the previous value**
