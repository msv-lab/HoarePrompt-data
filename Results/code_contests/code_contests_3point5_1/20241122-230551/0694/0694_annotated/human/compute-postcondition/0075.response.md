According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is 2**
