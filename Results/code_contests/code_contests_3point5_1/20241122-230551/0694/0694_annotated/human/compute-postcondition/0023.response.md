According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, so they do not need adjustment. However, since `i` is incremented by 1, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is now 1. 
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is 1**
