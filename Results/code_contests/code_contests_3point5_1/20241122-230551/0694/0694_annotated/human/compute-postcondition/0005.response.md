According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `w` is an integer between 3 and 300. `h` being greater than 0 does not directly impact the loop execution. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, and `j` is 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
