According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `h`, and the condition that `w` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` reaches the value of `w - 1`. The program prints '#' if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no output is generated. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` should be incremented by 1.
2. If the condition to print '#' is met, adjust `j` to be 0 again.
State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
