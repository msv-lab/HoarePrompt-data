According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w - 1`, `i` is less than `h - 1. If i is 0 or j is 0 or i is h - 1 or j is w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w - 1`.
State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w - 1`, `i` is less than `h - 1, `j` is less than `w - 1`.**
