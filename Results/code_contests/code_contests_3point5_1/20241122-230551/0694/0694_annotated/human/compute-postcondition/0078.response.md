Postcondition: ***h is greater than 0, w remains unchanged, j is 2. If i is equal to 0 or j is equal to 0 or i is equal to h - 1 or j is equal to w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. This covers all cases where the program either prints '#' or '.' based on the conditions involving i, j, h, and w.***
