Postcondition: ***`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `i` is one more than the previous value. If `(i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1)` is true, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. In all cases, the values of `h`, `w`, `j`, and `i` remain intact after the execution of the if-else block.***
