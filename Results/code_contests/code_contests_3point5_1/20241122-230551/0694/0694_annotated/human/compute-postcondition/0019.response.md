According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `h`, and `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than w - 1. So the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` should be less than w - 1.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, and `j` is less than w - 1**
