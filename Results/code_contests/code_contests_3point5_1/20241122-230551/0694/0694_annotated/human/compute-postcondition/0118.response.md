According to the code, the loop can execute if `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w-1`, and `i` is less than `h-1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `h - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w - 1`, `i` is less than or equal to `h - 1`**
