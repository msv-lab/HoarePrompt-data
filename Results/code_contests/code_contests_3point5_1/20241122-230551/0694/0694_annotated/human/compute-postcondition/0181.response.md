Output State: **If both `h` and `w` are greater than 0, the loop will execute `h x w` times. After the loop executes, `h`, `w`, and `j` will remain unchanged, and `i` will be equal to `h-1`. The program will print '#' if either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`; otherwise, it will print '.'. If either `h` or `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.**
