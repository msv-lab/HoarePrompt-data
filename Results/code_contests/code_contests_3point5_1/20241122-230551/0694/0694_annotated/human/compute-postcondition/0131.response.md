According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then `#` is printed. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, `.` is printed. Since the loop is controlled by `j` and `w`, you need to adjust the state in such a way that `j` is less than `w` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`**
