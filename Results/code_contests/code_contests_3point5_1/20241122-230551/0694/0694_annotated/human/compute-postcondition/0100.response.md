According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is between 0 and `w-1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `h`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next `i` value should be considered. Therefore, `i` needs to be less than `h - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is between 0 and `w-1`, `i` is less than `h - 1**
