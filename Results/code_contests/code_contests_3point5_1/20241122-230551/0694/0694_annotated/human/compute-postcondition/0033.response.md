According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `w`, `h`, and `i`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is 1**
