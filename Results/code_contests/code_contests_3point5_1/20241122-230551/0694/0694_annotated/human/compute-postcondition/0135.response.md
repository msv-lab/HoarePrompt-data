According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `j` are integers where `h` and `w` are greater than 0, and `j` is less than `w`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` are integers where `h` and `w` are greater than 0, and `j` is less than `w + 1**`.
