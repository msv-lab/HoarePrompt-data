Output State: If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the loop won't execute. Otherwise, the loop iterates through each value of `i` from 0 to `h-1` and each value of `j` from 0 to `w-1`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h-1`, or `j` is `w-1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop won't execute. After the loop executes, `h` and `w` remain as input integers, `i` is an integer less than `h`, and `j` is an integer less than `w`.
