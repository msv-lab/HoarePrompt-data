Output State: **After the loop executes, the loop prints either '#' or '.' based on the conditions provided. The loop will iterate w times, printing '#' when i is 0, j is 0, i is h - 1, or j is w - 1; otherwise, it prints '.'. The final state will have h, w, and i unchanged, and j will be equal to w-1. If h is not greater than 0 or if w is not between 3 and 300, the loop will not execute.**
