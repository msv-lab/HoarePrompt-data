According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is between 0 and `w`, and `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and `i` must remain within the specified range. 
State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is between 0 and `w`, `i` is incremented by 1**
