According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `j` is 1**
