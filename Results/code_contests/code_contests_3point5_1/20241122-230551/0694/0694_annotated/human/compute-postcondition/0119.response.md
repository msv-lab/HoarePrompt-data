Output State: **If h is greater than 0 and w is greater than 0, the loop will execute printing '#' when i is 0, j is 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, otherwise it prints '.'. After the loop execution, h remains greater than 0, w remains unchanged, i is less than h - 1, and j is between 0 and w - 1. If w is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no output is generated. If h is 0 or w is 0, the loop does not execute and no output is generated.**
