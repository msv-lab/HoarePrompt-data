According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. As `j` starts at 0 and iterates up to (w-1), the loop will execute for `w` iterations. 
State: **`h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, `j` is 0, `j` iterates up to (w-1)**.
