According to the code, the `while True` loop will execute indefinitely. Since the loop will execute `h x w` times if both `h` and `w` are greater than 0 and the loop will print '#' under certain conditions, we need to ensure that `h` and `w` are greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` and `w` are greater than 0**
