According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `j` is equal to `w-1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `h`, so `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
