According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w-1`, `i` is less than `h - 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` remains greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is between 0 and `w`, `i` is less than `h - 1**
