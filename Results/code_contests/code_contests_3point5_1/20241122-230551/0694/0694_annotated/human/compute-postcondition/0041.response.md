According to the code, the loop can execute if `w` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `i` needs to be one more than the previous value for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `h`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and `i` is one more than the previous value.
State: **`h` is unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `i` is one more than the previous value**
