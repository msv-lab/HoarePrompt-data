According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer between 3 and 300, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1**
