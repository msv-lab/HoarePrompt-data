According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, and `j` is 2. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 so that the loop can continue. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **h is greater than 0, w remains unchanged, j is 3**
