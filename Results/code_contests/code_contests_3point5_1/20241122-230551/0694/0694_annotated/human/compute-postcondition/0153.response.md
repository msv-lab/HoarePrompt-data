According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is an integer less than `h`, and `j` is 1. Since `j` is 1, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`h`, `w` are positive integers, `i` is an integer less than `h`, `j` is 2**
