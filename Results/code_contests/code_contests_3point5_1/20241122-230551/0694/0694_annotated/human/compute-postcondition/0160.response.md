According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `w`. If `w` is not 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is an integer less than `h`, `j` is an integer. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous iteration, and `j` should be reset to 0. No other states need adjustment.

State: **`h` and `w` are positive integers, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, `j` is 0**
