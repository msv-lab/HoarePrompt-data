Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly draw the frame as described in the problem statement. It prints '#' for every cell in the frame instead of printing '.' for the inner cells. The logic in the program is incorrect as it should print '#' only for the border cells and '.' for the inner cells. 

Example:
Input
3 4
Output
####
####
####

In the above example, the program should output:
####
#..#
####

This example demonstrates that the program does not work correctly for all cases.
