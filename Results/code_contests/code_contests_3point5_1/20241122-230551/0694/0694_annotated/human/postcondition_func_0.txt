The function `func` reads input for `h` and `w` until both are 0. It then prints a grid of '#' and '.' characters based on the values of `h` and `w`. If either `h` or `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. However, the annotations mention constraints on the values of `h` and `w` (3 <= h <= 300 and 3 <= w <= 300) which are not enforced in the actual code. Additionally, the function does not explicitly return any value.
