Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly draw the frame based on the problem description. The issue lies in how the program prints the characters. Each character should be printed on the same line, but the program is printing each character on a new line. Additionally, the condition for printing '#' characters is incorrect, as it should check if the current position is on the border of the frame. 

Example:
Input
