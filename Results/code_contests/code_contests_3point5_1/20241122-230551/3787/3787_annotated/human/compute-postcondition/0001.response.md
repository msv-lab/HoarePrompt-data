Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value of the stripped input, where `input()` accepts user input and `strip()` removes any leading/trailing whitespaces. The variable `K` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: K is an input integer, S is the stripped input string.
Output State: **K is an input integer, S is the stripped input string**
