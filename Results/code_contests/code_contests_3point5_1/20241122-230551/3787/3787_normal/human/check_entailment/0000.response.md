Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It reads an integer K and a string S from the user input. If the length of the string S is less than or equal to K, it prints the string S. If the length of S is greater than K, it prints the first K characters of S followed by '...'. The code also ensures the constraints of the problem by checking that K is between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and that S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function always returns 0 after printing the desired output. The code is simple and straightforward, meeting all the requirements of the problem description.
