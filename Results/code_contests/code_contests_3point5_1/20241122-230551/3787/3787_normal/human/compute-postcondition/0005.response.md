Example Answer:
The code slices the first `K` characters of string `S` and appends '...' to the end. Since `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 and `S` is a string with a length larger than `K`, the slicing operation is valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length larger than `K`.
Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length larger than `K`**
