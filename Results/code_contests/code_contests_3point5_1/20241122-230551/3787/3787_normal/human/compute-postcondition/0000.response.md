Example Answer:
`K` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `K` can be any integer between 1 and 100, the value of `K` after execution is in that range. The string `S` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100**
