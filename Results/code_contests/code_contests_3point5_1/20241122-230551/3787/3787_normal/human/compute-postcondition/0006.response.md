Postcondition: ***`K` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100. If the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`, the program outputs the string `S`. If the length of `S` is larger than `K`, the program outputs the first `K` characters of `S` followed by '...'.***
