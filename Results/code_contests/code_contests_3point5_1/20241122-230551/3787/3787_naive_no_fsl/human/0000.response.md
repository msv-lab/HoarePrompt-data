Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input integer K and a string S, then checks if the length of S is less than or equal to K. If it is, it prints the string S. Otherwise, it extracts the first K characters in S, appends '...' to the end of them, and prints the result. The program logic follows the problem description for all potential cases. The constraints are also respected. The program handles the given examples correctly and there are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
