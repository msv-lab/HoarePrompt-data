Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the good letters and pattern as input, then processes n query strings to determine if the pattern matches each query string.
- If the pattern contains "*", it splits the pattern into two parts and performs specific comparisons based on the parts.
- If the pattern does not contain "*", it compares each character in the pattern and query string to check for matches.
- The code correctly handles cases where the pattern contains "?" and "*", and adjusts the comparisons accordingly.
- The logic in the code aligns with the problem description, as it checks for the matching conditions as specified.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output based on the comparisons made.
