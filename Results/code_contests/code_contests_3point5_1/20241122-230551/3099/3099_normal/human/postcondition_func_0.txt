The function `func` reads user inputs to manipulate strings according to predefined patterns. If the input string contains '*', it splits the string into two parts and performs specific comparisons. The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the comparisons meet the defined conditions. If the input string does not contain '*', it performs character comparisons between two strings and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
