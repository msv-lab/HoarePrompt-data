Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list where the element at index `i` is not equal to '?'. If the element at index `i` in list `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `qr', then 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False. Additionally, the loop is exited.***
