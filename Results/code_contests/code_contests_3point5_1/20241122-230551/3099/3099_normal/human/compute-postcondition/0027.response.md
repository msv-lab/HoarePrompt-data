Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` matches the character at index `i` in string `p` or if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is "?", the program checks if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`. If not, the output is 'NO' and `y` is set to False, breaking the loop. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not "?", the program checks if the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q` are equal. If not, the output is 'NO' and `y` is set to False, breaking the loop. This covers all possible scenarios and outcomes after the execution of the if else block.***
