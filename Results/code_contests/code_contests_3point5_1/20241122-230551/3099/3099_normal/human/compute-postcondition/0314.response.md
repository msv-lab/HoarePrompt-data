Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list. If the element at index `i` in the list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False. If the element at index `i` in the list `p1` is equal to '?', then 'NO' is printed. If the element at index `i` in list `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `qr', then 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False. In all cases, the loop is exited, and the program state remains consistent with the initial precondition.***
