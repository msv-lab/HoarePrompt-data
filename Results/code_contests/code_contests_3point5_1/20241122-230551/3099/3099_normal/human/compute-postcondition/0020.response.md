Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `i` is 0. The character at index `i` in string `p` is "?". If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y` to False. In all cases, the program breaks after the if statement.***
