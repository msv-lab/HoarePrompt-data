According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `gls`, `p`, `plen`, `n`, `q`, `qlen`, and `y` are in their respective states. Since the loop is supposed to execute one more time, the `_` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is less than `n` for the next iteration. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is a string input decreased by 1, `q` is a string input with length equal to `plen`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False based on the conditions evaluated in the if and elif parts**
