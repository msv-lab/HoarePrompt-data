Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0. If qr[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program remains in a consistent state with `y0` being True, `y1` being either True or False, `i` being 1, and `p1len` being greater than 0.***
