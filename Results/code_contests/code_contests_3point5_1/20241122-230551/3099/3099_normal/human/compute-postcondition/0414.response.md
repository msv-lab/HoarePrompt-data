Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean initially set to True. `i` is an integer initialized to 0. `p1len` is an integer greater than 0. If the element at index `i` in list `p1` is equal to '?', then in the if part, if the element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the element at index `i` in list `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The final state includes `y1` as a boolean that could be either True or False, `i` as an integer that remains 0, and `p1len` as an integer that remains greater than 0.***
