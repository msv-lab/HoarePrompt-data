According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 2, `n` is a string input decreased by 4, `q` is a string input with length equal to the new value of `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the new value of `q`, `y` is either True or False. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `plen` should be greater than the current `plen` value to continue the loop.
- `n` should be further decreased by 4 to reflect the new input value.
- `q` should have a length equal to the new value of `plen`.
- `qlen` should be adjusted to the length of the new value of `q`.
- `y` should remain as True if no conditions in the loop body change it to False.

State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than the current value, `n` is a string input further decreased by 4, `q` is a string input with length equal to the new value of `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the new value of `q`, `y` is either True or False**
