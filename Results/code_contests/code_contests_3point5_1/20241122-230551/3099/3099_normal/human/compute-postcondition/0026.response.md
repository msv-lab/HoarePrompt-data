Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is either True or False, `i` is 0. The character at index `i` in string `p` is not "?" and is compared with the character at index `i` in string `q`. If they are not equal, the output is 'NO' and `y` is set to False. The program breaks after the if condition is checked. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and outcomes after the execution of the if statement.***
