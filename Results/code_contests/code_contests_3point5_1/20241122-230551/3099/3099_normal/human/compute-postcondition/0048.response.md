According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean that signifies whether the character at index `i` in string `q` matches the character at index `i` in string `p` or if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `i` is 3**
