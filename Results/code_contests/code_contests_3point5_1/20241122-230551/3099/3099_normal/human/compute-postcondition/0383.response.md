Postcondition: ***q is a valid input that allows the loop to continue, y0 is a boolean indicating the state of the loop. If p0[i] is equal to '?', and q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p0[i] is not equal to '?', and p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. p0len is greater than 0, i is 1. This postcondition covers all possible cases where the loop can exit based on the conditions inside the if else block.***
