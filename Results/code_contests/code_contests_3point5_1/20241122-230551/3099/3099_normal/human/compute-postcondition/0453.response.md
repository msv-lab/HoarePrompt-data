According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` remains a boolean value, `i` reaches the value of `p1len - 1`, and the postcondition after the if-else block is satisfied. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`y1` remains a boolean value, `i` reaches the value of `p1len - 1`, postcondition after if-else block is satisfied**
