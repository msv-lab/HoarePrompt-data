Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in the list `p1` is not equal to '?' and is compared with the element at index `i` in the list `qr`. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Overall, after the if else block executes, `y0` remains True, `y1` can be either True or False, `i` remains 0, and the length of `p1` remains greater than 0. The element at index `i` in `p1` is ensured not to be equal to '?' and is checked against the corresponding element in `qr`.***
