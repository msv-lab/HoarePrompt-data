According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean (True or False), `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`y1` is a boolean (True or False), `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0**
