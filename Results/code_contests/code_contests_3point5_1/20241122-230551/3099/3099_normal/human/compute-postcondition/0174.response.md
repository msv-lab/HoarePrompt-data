According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `p0len`. At the end of the previous iteration, `gls`, `p`, `plen`, `n`, `p0`, `p1`, `p1len`, `q`, `qlen`, and `y0` retain their initial values and relationships. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue iterating through `p0`.

State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y0` is a boolean, `i` is incremented by 1**
