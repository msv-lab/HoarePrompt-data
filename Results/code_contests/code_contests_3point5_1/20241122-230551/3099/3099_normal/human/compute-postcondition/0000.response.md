Example Answer:
`gls` is assigned the value of the input string, and based on the initial state, `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters. Therefore, the Output State is: gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105. n is a positive integer. For each query string q, it is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, and the total length of all query strings is not greater than 105.
