Postcondition: ***`t` remains a slice of list `q`, `p1len` is 0, `p1` and `qr` remain unchanged, `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `q` is assigned the value of the raw input, `qlen` is the length of list `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
