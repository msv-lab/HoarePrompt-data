Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. The value of `q` will depend on the user input, which can be any string. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string.
Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string**
