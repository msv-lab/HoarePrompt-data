Postcondition: ***`y0` remains True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` remains 1, `p1len` is still greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. In all cases, the program maintains the initial conditions of `y0`, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len`, ensuring the program's overall consistency and correctness.***
