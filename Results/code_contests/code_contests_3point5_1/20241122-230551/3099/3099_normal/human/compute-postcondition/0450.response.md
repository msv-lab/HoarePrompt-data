Postcondition: ***`y1` remains a boolean value (either True or False), `i` reaches the value of `p1len - 1`. If `p1len` is 0 or negative, `y1` remains the same and `t` is assigned the value of `q[p0len:]`. If `p1len` is positive, `t` is assigned the value of the slice of `q` from index `p0len` to the negative index of `p1len`. Additionally, if the intersection between `t` and `good_letters` has at least one element, the program prints 'NO' and continues. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if else block.***
