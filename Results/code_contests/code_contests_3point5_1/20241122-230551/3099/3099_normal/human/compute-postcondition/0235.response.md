According to the code, the loop can execute one more time as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y0` remains True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is still greater than 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 3.
State: **`y0` remains True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is 3, `p1len` is still greater than 0**
