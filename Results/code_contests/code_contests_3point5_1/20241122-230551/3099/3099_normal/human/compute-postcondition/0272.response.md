Postcondition: ***t remains a slice of list q, p1len is 0, p1 and qr remain unchanged, y0 is False, y1 is False, i is 0, q is assigned the value of the raw input, qlen is the length of list q, p0len is greater than 0, i goes from 0 to p0len - 1, p0[i] is not equal to '?'. If p0[i] is not equal to q[i], then 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the program maintains the initial values and conditions, with the exception of y0 being set to False when a mismatch between p0 and q is encountered in the loop.***
