Output State: **`t` is a slice of the list `q`, `p1len` is 0, `p1` and `qr` remain unchanged, `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `i` is the index of the last iteration. If the intersection of elements in `t` and `good_letters` has a length greater than 0, then 'NO' is printed and the program continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
