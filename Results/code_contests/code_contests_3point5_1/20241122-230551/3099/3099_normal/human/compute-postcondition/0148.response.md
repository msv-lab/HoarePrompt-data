Example Answer:
The string p is split at the "*" character, and the resulting substrings are assigned to p0 and p1. The values of gls, p, characters "?", and plen are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, plen is the length of string p, n is a string input, p0 contains the characters before "*", p1 contains the characters after "*".
Output State: **gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, plen is the length of string p, n is a string input, p0 contains the characters before "*", p1 contains the characters after "*"**
