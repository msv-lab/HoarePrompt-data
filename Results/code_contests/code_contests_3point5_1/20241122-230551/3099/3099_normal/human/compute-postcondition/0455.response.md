Postcondition: ***gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", plen is the length of string p, n is a string input that decreases by 1 after each iteration. If '*' is not in p, the loop executes for n iterations. For each iteration, the user inputs a string q, and if qlen is not equal to plen, 'NO' is printed. The loop then compares each character of p and q based on given conditions, printing 'NO' and setting y to False if conditions are not met. If all comparisons pass, 'YES' is printed. If '*' is in p, p is split into p0 and p1, the loop executes for n iterations. For each iteration, a string q is inputted, and if qlen is less than plen - 1, 'NO' is printed. The loop then compares p0 and the prefix of q, followed by p1 and the suffix of q, reversing p1 for comparison. If all comparisons pass, a substring t is extracted from q to check against good_letters. If t contains any elements from good_letters, 'NO' is printed. If all conditions are met, 'YES' is printed.***
