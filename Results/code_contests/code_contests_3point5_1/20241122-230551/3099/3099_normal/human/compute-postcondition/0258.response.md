Postcondition: ***`t` remains a slice of list `q`, `p1len` is 0, `p1` and `qr` remain unchanged, `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `i` is the index of the last iteration + 1, `q` is assigned the value of the raw input, `qlen` is the length of list `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, the program prints 'NO' and continues.***
