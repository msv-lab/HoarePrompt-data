Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 2, `n` is a string input decreased by 4, `q` is a string input with length equal to the new value of `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the new value of `q`, `y` is either True or False. If the character at index `i` in `q` is not in the set of good_letters, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is exited. This covers the cases where the condition is not met and ensures `y` reflects the outcome of the if statement.***
