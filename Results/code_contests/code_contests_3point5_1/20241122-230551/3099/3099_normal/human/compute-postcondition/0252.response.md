Postcondition: ***`t` is a slice of list `q`, `p1len` is 0, `p1` and `qr` remain unchanged, `y0` is True, `y1` is False, and `i` is the index of the last iteration. If the intersection of elements in `t` and `good_letters` has a length greater than 0, then 'NO' is printed and the program continues. Otherwise, all variables remain in their initial state. After the execution of the if statement, the program has no changes in its variables.***
