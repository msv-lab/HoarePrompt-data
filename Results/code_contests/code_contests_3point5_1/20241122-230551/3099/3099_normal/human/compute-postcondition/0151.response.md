Example Answer:
The length of string `p1` is calculated and assigned to `p1len`. The value of `p1` is the length of the original `p1` string, which was the reverse of the original `p1` string. Therefore, the Output State is: gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, plen is the length of string p, n is a string input, p0 contains the characters before "*", p1 contains the characters after "*", p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string, p0len is the length of p0, p1len is the length of the original p1 string.
Output State: **gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, plen is the length of string p, n is a string input, p0 contains the characters before "*", p1 contains the characters after "*", p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string, p0len is the length of p0, p1len is the length of the original p1 string**
