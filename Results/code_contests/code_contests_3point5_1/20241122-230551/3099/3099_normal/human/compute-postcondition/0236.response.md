Output State: **If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop iterates through the elements of `p1`. If `p1[i]` is '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If this condition is true, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. After the loop execution, `y0` remains True, `y1` can be either True or False, `i` is the index of the last iteration, and the lengths of `p1` and `qr` remain the same.**
