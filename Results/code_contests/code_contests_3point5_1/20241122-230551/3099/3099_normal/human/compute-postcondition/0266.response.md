Postcondition: ***t remains a slice of list q, p1len is 0, p1 and qr remain unchanged, y0 is False, y1 is False, i is 0, q is assigned the value of the raw input, qlen is the length of list q, p0len is greater than 0, i goes from 0 to p0len - 1. The ith element of p0 is '?' and if q[i] is not in good_letters, then 'NO' is printed and y0 is set to False. In all cases, the break statement is encountered after the if condition.***
