Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is a string input decreased by 2, `q` is a string input with length equal to `plen`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False based on the conditions evaluated in the if and elif parts. If the character at position i in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` becomes False, and the loop breaks. If the character at position i in string `p` is not "?", and it is not equal to the character at position i in string `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` becomes False, and the loop breaks.***
