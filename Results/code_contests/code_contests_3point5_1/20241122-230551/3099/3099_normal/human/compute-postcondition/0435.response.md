According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, and `y1` should not be set to False and the conditions mentioned should not have occurred.
State: **`y1` is a boolean (True or False), `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 0**
