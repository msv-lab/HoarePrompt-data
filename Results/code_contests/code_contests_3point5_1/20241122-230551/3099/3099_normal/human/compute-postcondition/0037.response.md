Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` matches the character at index `i` in string `p` or if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `i` is 1. The program fragment correctly handles the scenarios where the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters` or if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, printing 'NO', setting `y` to False, and breaking the loop. The postcondition covers all possible cases and ensures the appropriate state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
