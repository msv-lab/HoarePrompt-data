Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 2, `n` is a string input decreased by 4, `q` is a string input with length equal to the new value of `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the new value of `q`, `y` is True or False based on the conditions evaluated in the if and elif parts. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is broken. This covers all possible scenarios for the given program fragment.***
