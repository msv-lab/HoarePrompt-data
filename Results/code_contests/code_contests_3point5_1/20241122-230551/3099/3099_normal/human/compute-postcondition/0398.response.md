Postcondition: ***q is a valid input that allows the loop to continue. If the length of q is less than the length of p0 minus 1, 'NO' is printed, and the loop does not execute. If p0[i] is equal to '?', and q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p0[i] is not equal to '?', and p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. p0len is greater than 0, i is the current index of the loop. Additionally, if y0 is False, the loop continues without executing.***
