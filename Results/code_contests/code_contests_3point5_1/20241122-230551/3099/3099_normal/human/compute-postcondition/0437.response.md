Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `y1` is a boolean that could be either True or False based on the conditions met during the loop. `i` is an integer that reaches the value of `p1len - 1` after the loop completes. If the loop does not execute (if `p1len` is 0 or negative), `y1` remains True. In addition, `y1` is False***
