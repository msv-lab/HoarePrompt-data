According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters
- `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", with 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105
- `plen` is the length of string `p`
- `n` is a string input greater than 0
- `q` is a user input string
- `qlen` is the length of `q`
- `y` is a boolean

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `n` should be decreased by 1 to indicate that the loop will execute one more time.

State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", with 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean**
