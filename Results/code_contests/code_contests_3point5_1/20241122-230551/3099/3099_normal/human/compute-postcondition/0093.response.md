Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is a string input greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean that is True if all characters in `q` are in `good_letters`, and False otherwise, `i` is less than `plen + 1. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and terminates the loop. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. All conditions are handled appropriately, ensuring the program maintains the initial state described in the precondition.***
