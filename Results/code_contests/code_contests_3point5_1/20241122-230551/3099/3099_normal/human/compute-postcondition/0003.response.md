Example Answer:
The length of string p is assigned to plen. The value of plen depends on the length of string p, which is given as 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105. Therefore, the output state is: gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, n is a positive integer, plen is the length of string p.
Output State: **gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, n is a positive integer, plen is the length of string p**
