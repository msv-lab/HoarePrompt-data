Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i` in the list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False. Otherwise, `y1` remains True. In either case, `i` remains 0, and `p1len` is greater than 0. If the element at index `i` in the list `p1` is equal to '?', then 'NO' is printed.***
