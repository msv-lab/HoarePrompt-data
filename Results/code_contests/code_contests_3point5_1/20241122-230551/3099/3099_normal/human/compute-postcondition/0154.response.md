Example Answer:
The variable `qlen` is assigned the length of the string `q`. The previous values of the affected variables are `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string, `q` is a user input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of string `q`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of string `q**.
