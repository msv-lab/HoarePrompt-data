Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, if p0len is greater than 0 and y0 is False due to a mismatch between p0 and q at any index, causing the loop to break, all variables retain their initial values except y0 being False. If p0len is 0 or qlen is less than p0len - 1, the program prints 'NO' without altering the initial state.***
