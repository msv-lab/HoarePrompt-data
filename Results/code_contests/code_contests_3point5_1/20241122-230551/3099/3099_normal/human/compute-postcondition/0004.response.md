Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the input, which could be any string. The variables `gls`, `p`, and `plen` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, plen is the length of string p, n is a string input.
Output State: **gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, plen is the length of string p, n is a string input**
