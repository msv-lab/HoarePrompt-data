Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed and the program continues. This ensures that the lengths of the user input string and string p are the same, maintaining the initial state of the variables.***
