Postcondition: ***`y1` remains a boolean value (either True or False) after the loop executes, `i` reaches the value of `p1len - 1`. If `p1len` is 0 or negative, `y1` remains the same. `t` is assigned the value of `q[p0len:]` if `p1len` is 0 or negative. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value of the slice of `q` from index `p0len` to the negative index of `p1len`. The set intersection between `t` and `good_letters` has at least one element.***
