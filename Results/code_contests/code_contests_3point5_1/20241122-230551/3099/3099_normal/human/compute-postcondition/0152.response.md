According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, and `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string.
