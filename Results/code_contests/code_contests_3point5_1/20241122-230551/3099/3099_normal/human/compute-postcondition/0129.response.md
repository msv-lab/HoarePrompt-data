Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 1, `n` is a string input decreased by 4, `q` is a string input with length equal to the new value of `plen`, `qlen` is the length of the new value of `q`, `y` is True or False based on the conditions evaluated in the if and elif parts. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if the character at index `i` in `q` is not in good_letters. If it is not, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?', the program checks if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`. If they are not equal, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks. All initial conditions are preserved after the execution of the if else block, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
