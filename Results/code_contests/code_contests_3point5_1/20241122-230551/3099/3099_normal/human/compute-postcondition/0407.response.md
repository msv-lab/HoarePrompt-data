Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, initially set to True. `i` is an integer initialized to 0. `p1len` is an integer greater than 0. `p1` is a list, and the element at index `i` is equal to '?'. In the if part, if the element at index `i` in `qr` is not in the list `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This results in `y1` being False.***
