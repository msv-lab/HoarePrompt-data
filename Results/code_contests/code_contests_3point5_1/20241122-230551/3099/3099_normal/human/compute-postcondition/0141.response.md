Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is a string input decreased by 2, `q` is a string input with length equal to `plen`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False based on the conditions evaluated in the if and elif parts. If the length of `q` is not equal to `plen`, the program prints 'NO' and `y` becomes False. The loop iterates over the characters of `p` and `q`, checking if they match or if the character in `q` is not in `good_letters`. If a mismatch is found or a character is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks.**
