Postcondition: ***`y0` remains True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is still greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop.***
