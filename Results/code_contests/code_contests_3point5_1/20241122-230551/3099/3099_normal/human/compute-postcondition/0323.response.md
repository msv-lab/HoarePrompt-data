Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. This condition covers all cases where `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`.***
