Output State: **`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list. If `p1` has elements that are not in `good_letters` when they correspond to '?' in `p1`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If there are elements in `p1` that do not match the corresponding elements in `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p1` is empty or `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute and the initial state is maintained with `y1` as True.**
