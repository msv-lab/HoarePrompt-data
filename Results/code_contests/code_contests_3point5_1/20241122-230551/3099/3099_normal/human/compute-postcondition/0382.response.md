Postcondition: ***`q` is a valid input that allows the loop to continue, `y0` is a boolean indicating the state of the loop. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken. `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. This covers the case where the condition in the if statement is not satisfied and the program breaks out of the loop.***
