Example Answer:
The value of p0len is assigned the length of string p0. The previous state of the variables gls, p, plen, n, p0, and p1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, plen is the length of string p, n is a string input, p0 contains the characters before "*", p1 contains the characters after "*", p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string, p0len is the length of p0.
Output State: **gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, plen is the length of string p, n is a string input, p0 contains the characters before "*", p1 contains the characters after "*", p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string, p0len is the length of p0**
