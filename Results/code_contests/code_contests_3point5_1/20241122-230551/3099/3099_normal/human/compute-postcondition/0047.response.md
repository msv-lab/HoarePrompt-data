Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean that signifies whether the character at index `i` in string `q` matches the character at index `i` in string `p` or if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `i` is 2. If `p[i]` is '?', then if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop. If `p[i]` is not '?', and `p[i]` does not match `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The postcondition encompasses the varied outcomes of the if else block, ensuring the correctness of the program's behavior in handling different scenarios, including edge cases.***
