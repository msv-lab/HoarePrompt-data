Postcondition: ***t remains a slice of list q, p1len is 0, p1 and qr remain unchanged, y0 is False, y1 is False, i is 0, q is assigned the value of the raw input, qlen is the length of list q, p0len is greater than 0, i goes from 0 to p0len - 1. If p0[i] is '?', and q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, and y0 is set to False. If p0[i] is not '?', and p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, and y0 is set to False. In either case, the loop breaks ensuring no change in the initial state except for y0 being set to False when a mismatch occurs between p0 and q.***
