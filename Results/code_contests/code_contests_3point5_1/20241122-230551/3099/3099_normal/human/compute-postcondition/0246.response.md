Postcondition: ***`t` is a slice of the list `q`. If `p1len` is 0, `t` is assigned the value of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value of `q` from index `p0len` up to the end minus `p1len`. In both cases, `p1len` remains 0, `p1` and `qr` are unchanged, `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `i` is the index of the last iteration. The intersection of elements in `t` and `good_letters` has a length greater than 0.***
