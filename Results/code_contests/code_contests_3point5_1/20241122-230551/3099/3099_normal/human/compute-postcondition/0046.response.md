Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` matches the character at index `i` in string `p` or if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `i` is 2. If `p[i]` does not match `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The overall state of the program after the if statement executes is determined by the conditions described above, ensuring the integrity of the variables and their relationships under different scenarios, including edge cases.***
