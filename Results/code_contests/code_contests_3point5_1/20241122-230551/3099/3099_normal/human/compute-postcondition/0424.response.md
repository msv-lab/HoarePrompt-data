Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean (True or False), `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
