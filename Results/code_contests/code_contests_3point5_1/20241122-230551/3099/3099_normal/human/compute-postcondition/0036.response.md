Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` matches the character at index `i` in string `p` or if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `i` is 1. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output prints 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This accounts for all possible cases when comparing the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q`, ensuring the correct behavior and state of the program after execution.***
