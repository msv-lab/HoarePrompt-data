Postcondition: ***`q` is a valid input that allows the loop to continue, `y0` is True, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `p0` is equal to '?' and the element at index `i` in list `q` is not in `good_letters'. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters', then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is terminated.***
