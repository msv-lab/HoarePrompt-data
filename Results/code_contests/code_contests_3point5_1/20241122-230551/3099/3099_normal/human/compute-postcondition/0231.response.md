Example Answer:
`y1` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `y1` can be either True or False, but after execution, `y1` is specifically set to False. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` remains True, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is still greater than 0.
Output State: **`y0` remains True, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is still greater than 0**
