Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean indicating whether the conditions specified for each character comparison in strings `p` and `q` are met. The loop iterates over each character in string `p` and verifies if the character at the corresponding index in string `q` satisfies the conditions. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is "?", the program evaluates if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop terminates. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not "?", the program checks if the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q` are identical. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop stops. Upon completion of the loop, if `y` remains True, the output 'YES' is displayed.***
