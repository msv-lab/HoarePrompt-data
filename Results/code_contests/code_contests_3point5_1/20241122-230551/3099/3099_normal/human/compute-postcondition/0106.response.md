According to the code, the loop will execute if `plen` is greater than 0. Since `plen` is guaranteed to be greater than 0, no adjustment is needed for `plen`. However, the loop will only execute if the length of `q` is equal to `plen`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the length of `q` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `plen`. Additionally, since `n` is a string input decreased by 2, it needs to be adjusted accordingly. 

State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is a string input decreased by 2, `q` is a string input with length equal to `plen`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True**
