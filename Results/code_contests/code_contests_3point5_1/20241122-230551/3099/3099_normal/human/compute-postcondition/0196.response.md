Postcondition: ***If the length of string `q` is less than `plen - 1`, the loop does not execute, `y0` remains True. If the loop executes, for each character in `p0`, if it is a '?', the program checks if the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`. If this condition is met, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the characters do not match, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. All variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
