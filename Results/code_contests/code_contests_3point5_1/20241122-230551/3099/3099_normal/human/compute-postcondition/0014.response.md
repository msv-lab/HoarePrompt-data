According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `plen` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True, and `i` is 0.
State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True, `i` is 0**
