Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If this condition is true, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. After the execution of the if else block, `y0` remains True, `y1` can be either True or False, `i` remains 0, and the length of `p1` remains greater than 0. The element at index `i` in `p1` is ensured not to be equal to '?' and is checked against the corresponding element in `qr`.***
