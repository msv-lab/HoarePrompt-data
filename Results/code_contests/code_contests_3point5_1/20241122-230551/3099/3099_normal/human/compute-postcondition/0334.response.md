Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer less than `p1len + 1`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The postcondition encompasses all possible scenarios, ensuring the correct handling of the if and else conditions.***
