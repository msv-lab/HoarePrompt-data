According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list. If the loop is to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `p1len`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list**
