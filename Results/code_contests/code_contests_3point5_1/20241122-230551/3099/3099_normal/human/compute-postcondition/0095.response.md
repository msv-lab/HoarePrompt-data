Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is a string input greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean that is True if all characters in `q` are in `good_letters`, and False otherwise. If any character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not "?", then if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and reflects the final state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.**
