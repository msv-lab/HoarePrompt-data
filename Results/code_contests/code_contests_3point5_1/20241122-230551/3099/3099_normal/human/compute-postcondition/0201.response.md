According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `p1len`. If `p1len` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `y0` is True and `y1` is True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so the states need to be adjusted to `p1len` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is True, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0**
