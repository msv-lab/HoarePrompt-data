Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input greater than 0, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` matches the character at index `i` in string `p` or if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`. The loop iterates over each character in string `p` and checks if the character at the corresponding index in string `q` matches the conditions specified. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is "?", the program checks if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not "?", the program checks if the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q` are equal. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This logic covers all possible scenarios and outcomes after the loop's execution. Upon execution of the code snippet, the output 'YES' is printed.**
