Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y0` is a boolean. If a character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output "NO" is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the program terminates. Otherwise, if p0[i] is not equal to q[i], "NO" is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. All variables retain their initial values and relationships, and the conditions described handle all possible edge cases.***
