Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", and 1 ≤ |p| ≤ 105, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y0` is a boolean. If the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is terminated. This postcondition covers all possible cases after the execution of the if else block, ensuring the state of the variables and their relationships are accurately described.***
