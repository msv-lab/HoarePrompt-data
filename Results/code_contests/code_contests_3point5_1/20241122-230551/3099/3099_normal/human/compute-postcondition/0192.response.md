Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters and special characters, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y0` is a boolean, `i` is an integer less than `p0len`. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop. This represents the overall state of the program after the execution of the if else block, ensuring all edge cases are covered.***
