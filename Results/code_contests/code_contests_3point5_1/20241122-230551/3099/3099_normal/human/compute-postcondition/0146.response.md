Output State: **If the length of the string `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `gls` remains a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` remains a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` remains the length of string `p`, `n` is a string input that decreases by 1 after each iteration, `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean representing whether the conditions for each character comparison in strings `p` and `q` are met. If the length of `q` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` becomes False. The loop iterates over each character in string `p` and verifies if the character at the corresponding index in string `q` satisfies the conditions. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is "?", the program evaluates if the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop terminates. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not "?", and the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q` are not identical, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop stops. If `y` remains True after the loop, 'YES' is printed.**
