Postcondition: ***`t` remains a slice of list `q`, `p1len` is 0, `p1` and `qr` remain unchanged, `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is 1, `q` is assigned the value of the raw input, `qlen` is the length of list `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y0` remains False. In all cases, the loop breaks after the if condition is checked.***
