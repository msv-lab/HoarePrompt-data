Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters and special characters, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `p0` contains the characters before "*", `p1` contains the characters after "*", `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of the original `p1` string, `q` is a user input string, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y0` is a boolean, `i` is an integer. If `p0[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in `good_letters`. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. All other variables retain their original values after the execution of the if else block, ensuring the postcondition accurately reflects the state of the program.***
