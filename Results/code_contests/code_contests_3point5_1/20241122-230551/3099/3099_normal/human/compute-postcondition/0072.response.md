Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is a string input greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`. If the character at index `i` in `p` is not "?", then if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This scenario handles the case when there is a mismatch between the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q` causing the program to print 'NO', set `y` to False, and exit the loop.***
