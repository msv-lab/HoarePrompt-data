According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `p1len`, along with the conditions related to the elements of `p1` and `qr`. At the end of the last iteration, `y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. Increment the value of `i` by 1 to move to the next index for comparison.
2. Ensure that the new index `i` is within the range of `p1len` to continue iterating.
3. Update the condition to check if `p1[i]` is equal to '?' to proceed with the comparison.
4. If the conditions are met for the comparison, set `y1` to either True or False based on the comparison results.

State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0**
