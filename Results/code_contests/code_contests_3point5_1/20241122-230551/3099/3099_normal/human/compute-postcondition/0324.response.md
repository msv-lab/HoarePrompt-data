Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', the function checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If this condition is true, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks. Otherwise, if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks. This covers all scenarios where either `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters` or `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, ensuring proper error handling and termination of the program.***
