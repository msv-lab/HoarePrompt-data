Postcondition: ***`q` is a valid input that allows the loop to continue, `y0` is a boolean indicating the state of the loop, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` in list `p0` is equal to '?', then the element at index `i` in list `q` is not in `good_letters', 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop terminates. If the element at index `i` in list `p0` is not equal to '?', and the ith element of `p0` is not equal to the ith element of `q', 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks.***
