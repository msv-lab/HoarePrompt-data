Example Answer:
The input string `q` is assigned the user's raw input. The other variables (`gls`, `p`, `plen`, `n`, `qlen`, `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters with characters "?" and "*", `plen` is the length of string p, `n` is a string input greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `q` is the user input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a boolean.
