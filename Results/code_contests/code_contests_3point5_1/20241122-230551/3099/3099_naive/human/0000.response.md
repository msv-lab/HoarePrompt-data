Explanation: The program correctly handles the input as described in the problem statement. It checks if the pattern matches each query string and outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly. The program also correctly handles the cases where the pattern contains a "?" or a "*", and checks if the query string can be matched. The logic appears to be sound and covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description.
