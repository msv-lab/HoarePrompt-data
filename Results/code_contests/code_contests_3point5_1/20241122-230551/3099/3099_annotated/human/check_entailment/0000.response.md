Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given pattern matches a query string based on the problem description. It handles cases where the pattern contains '?' and '*' characters, and correctly checks if the query strings match the pattern by replacing '?' with good letters and '*' with any string of bad letters. The program iterates through each query string, comparing it to the pattern, and prints "YES" if the pattern matches the query string, and "NO" otherwise. The program handles both cases where '*' is present in the pattern and where it is not present, covering all potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. The logic within the program is sound and follows the requirements outlined in the problem description.
