The function does not accept any parameters and implements a conditional logic for string comparison. It reads input strings and compares them based on a predetermined pattern within the strings. Depending on the presence of certain characters and their positions, the function prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function handles cases where the input strings do not match the expected pattern by printing 'NO' and potentially skipping certain comparisons.
