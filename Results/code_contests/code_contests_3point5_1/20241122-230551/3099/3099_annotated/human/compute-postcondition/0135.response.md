Example Answer:
The code simply prints 'NO', and it does not affect the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is True, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters, `i` is less than `plen`, `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, and `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is True, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters, `i` is less than `plen`, `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, and `p[i]` is equal to `q[i`]**
