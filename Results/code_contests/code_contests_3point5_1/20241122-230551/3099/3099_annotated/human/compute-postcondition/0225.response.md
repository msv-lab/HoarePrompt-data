According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y0` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p0`, `p0` is not empty and satisfies conditions for `y0`. If the loop is to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `p1len+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`y0` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p0`, `p0` is not empty and satisfies conditions for `y0`, `i` is less than `p1len+1`**
