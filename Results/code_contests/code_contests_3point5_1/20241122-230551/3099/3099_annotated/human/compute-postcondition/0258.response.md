Postcondition: ***`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` and `y1` are booleans, `t` is a substring of `q`, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, then 'NO' is printed and the program continues. This ensures that the length of `q` is at least one character longer than the length of `p0` to proceed further.***
