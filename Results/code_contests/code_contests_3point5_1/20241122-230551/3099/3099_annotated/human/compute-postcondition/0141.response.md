Output State: **If qlen is not equal to plen, 'NO' is printed and the loop does not execute. If qlen is equal to plen, the loop compares each character of strings p and q. If a character in p at index i is '?', and the corresponding character in q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues with the initial values of the variables maintained.**
