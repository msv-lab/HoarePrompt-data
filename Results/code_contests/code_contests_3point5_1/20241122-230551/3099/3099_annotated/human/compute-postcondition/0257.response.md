Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the state of the program. It simply moves to the next iteration of the loop if one exists. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` and `y1` are booleans, `t` is a substring of `q`, and `qlen` is the length of `q`**
