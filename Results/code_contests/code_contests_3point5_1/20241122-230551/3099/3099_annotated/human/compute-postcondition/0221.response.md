Example Answer:
The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `y0`, `qr`, `p1len`, and `p0` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p0`, `p0` is not empty and satisfies conditions for `y0`, `y1` is False.
Output State: **`y0` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p0`, `p0` is not empty and satisfies conditions for `y0`, `y1` is False**
