Output State: **`y0` is True, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1` is adjusted accordingly, `p1len` is an integer representing the length of `p0` but greater than the current value, `t` has intersection with `good_letters`, `q` is assigned the raw input value, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y1` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
