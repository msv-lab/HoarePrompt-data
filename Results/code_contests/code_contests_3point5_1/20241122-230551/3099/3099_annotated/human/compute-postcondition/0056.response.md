Example Answer: 
The code prints 'NO' to the console. The values of variables `p`, `q`, `y`, and `qlen` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is True, `qlen` is the length of string `q`.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is True, `qlen` is the length of string `q`**
