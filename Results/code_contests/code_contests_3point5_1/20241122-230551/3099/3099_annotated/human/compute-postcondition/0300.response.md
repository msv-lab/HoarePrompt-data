Example Answer:
The variable `qr` is assigned the reversed version of the list `q` denoted by `q[::-1]`. Since the initial state does not provide information about the content of list `q`, the output state will be: y1 is True, and `qr` is the reversed version of list `q`.
Output State: **y1 is True, and `qr` is the reversed version of list `q`**
