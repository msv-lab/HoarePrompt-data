Example Answer:
The length of the string `q` is calculated and stored in `qlen`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, and `q` is assigned the value entered through raw_input(). Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `q` is the entered string, and `qlen` holds the length of string `q`.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `q` is the entered string, and `qlen` holds the length of string `q`**
