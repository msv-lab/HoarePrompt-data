Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the substring of `q` starting from the index `p0len` to the index `-p1len`. The values of `p0len` and `p1len` are not provided, so the exact substring cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `p0` is a string, `q` is a string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is a boolean, `y1` is a boolean, `t` is a substring of `q` with unknown indices.
Output State: **`p0` is a string, `q` is a string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is a boolean, `y1` is a boolean, `t` is a substring of `q` with unknown indices**
