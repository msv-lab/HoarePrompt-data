Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p0`, `p0` is not empty and satisfies conditions for `y0`. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then `y1` is set to False if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', then `y1` is set to False if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. In both cases, 'NO' is printed and the loop breaks. The program state remains consistent with the initial conditions specified in the Precondition.***
