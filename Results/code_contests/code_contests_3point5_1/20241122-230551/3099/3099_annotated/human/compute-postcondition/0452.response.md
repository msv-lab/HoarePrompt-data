Postcondition: ***`t` is a subset of list `q` based on the slicing indices, or None if `p1len` is 0. The length of `p1len` is not equal to 0. If the intersection of elements in `t` and `good_letters` is greater than 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of `t` or any other variable. When `y0` and `y1` are both true, the program prints 'YES'.***
