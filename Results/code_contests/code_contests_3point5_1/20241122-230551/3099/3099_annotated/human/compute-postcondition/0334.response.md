Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i+1` of list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the element at index `i+1` in list `p1` is not equal to '?' and not equal to the element at index `i+1` in list `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop breaks. In all other cases, the program continues with the initial conditions unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop executes one more time.***
