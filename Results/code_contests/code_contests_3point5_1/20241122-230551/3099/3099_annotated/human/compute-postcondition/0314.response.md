Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i` of list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the element at index `i` in list `p1` is not equal to '?', and it is also not equal to the element at index `i` in list `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. In all other cases, the program continues with the initial conditions unchanged.***
