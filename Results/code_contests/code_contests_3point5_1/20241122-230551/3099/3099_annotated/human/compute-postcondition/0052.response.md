Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings. If there is at least one index in string `p` where the character is a question mark '?' and the corresponding character in string `q` is not in the set `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If there is at least one index where the characters at the same position in strings `p` and `q` are not equal, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If none of these conditions are met, the loop executes until the end of string `p` is reached, 'YES' is printed, and `y` remains True.***
