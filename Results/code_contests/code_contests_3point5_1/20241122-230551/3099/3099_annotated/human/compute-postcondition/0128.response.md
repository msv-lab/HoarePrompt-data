Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is either True or False, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. This condition covers the case where the characters at position `i` in `p` and `q` are different.***
