Postcondition: ***After the loop iterates through each character of `p0` and compares it with the corresponding character in `q`, handling cases where a character in `p0` is '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, as well as cases where there is a mismatch between characters in `p0` and `q`, `y0` is set to False and 'NO' is printed. If the loop doesn't execute, implying `p0len` is 0, `y0` remains True.***
