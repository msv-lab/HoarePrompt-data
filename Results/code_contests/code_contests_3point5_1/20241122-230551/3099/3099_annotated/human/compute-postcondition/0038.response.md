According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `i` is 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `i` is 2**
