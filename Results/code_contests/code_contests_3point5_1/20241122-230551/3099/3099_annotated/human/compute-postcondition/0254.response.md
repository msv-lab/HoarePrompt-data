Example Answer: 
`q` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input as a string. The values of `p0`, `good_letters`, `y0`, `y1`, and `t` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` and `y1` are booleans, `t` is a substring of `q`.
Output State: **`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` and `y1` are booleans, `t` is a substring of `q`**
