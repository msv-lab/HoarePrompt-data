Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer. The loop has iterated through each character at index `i` in string `p` and checked the conditions. If there was a character mismatch or a '?' in `p` not matching with the character in `q` that is not in the list of good_letters, 'NO' was printed, `y` was set to False, and the loop broke. If the loop did not execute due to `plen` not being equal to `qlen`, 'NO' was printed and `y` remained True. After the if statement, 'YES' is printed if and only if `y` is True.***
