Example Answer: 
`y0` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The value of `y0` is now explicitly set as `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is False.
Output State: **`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is False**
