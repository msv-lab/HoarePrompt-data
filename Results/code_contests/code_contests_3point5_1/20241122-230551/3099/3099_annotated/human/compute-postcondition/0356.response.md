Example Answer: 
The code prints 'NO' to the console but does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `y1` is a boolean, `qr` is a list with all elements in `good_letters`, `good_letters` is a set, `p1` is adjusted accordingly, `p1len` is an integer, `t` is adjusted to have intersection with `good_letters` as 0, `q` is assigned the raw input value, `qlen` is the length of `q`.
