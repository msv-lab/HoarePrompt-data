Example Answer:
`y0` is assigned the value False. Since `y0` was previously True, the value has been changed to False. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is False.
Output State: **`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is False**
