Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean initialized as True. `qr` is the reversed version of list `q`. `i` is 0. `p1len` is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `p1` is not equal to '?' initially. After the execution of the if statement, if the element at index `i` in list `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. All initial conditions are retained, and the program continues to execute based on the updated value of `y1` and the break statement.***
