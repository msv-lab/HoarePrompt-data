Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is the input value. If '*' is not present in `p`, the program iterates `n` times, comparing each input string `q` to `p`. If the length of `q` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed. If the characters at each index 'i' in `p` and `q` do not match or if a character in `p` is '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed. If all characters are successfully compared, 'YES' is printed. If '*' is present in `p`, `p` is split into `p0` and `p1`. `p1` is reversed. The program then iterates `n` times, checking each input string `q`. If the length of `q` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed. The program then compares characters in `p0` and the beginning of `q`, followed by characters in `p1` and the reversed `q`. If any character mismatches or if a character in `p0` or `p1` is '?' and the corresponding character in `q` or the reversed `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed. If all comparisons are successful, a substring `t` is extracted from `q`. If any character in `t` is in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed. If all conditions are met, 'YES' is printed.***
