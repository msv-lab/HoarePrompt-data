Example Answer: 
The variable `plen` is assigned the length of the string `p`. The value of `p` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact length of `p` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`**
