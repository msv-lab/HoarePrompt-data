Postcondition: ***Output State: `p0` is a string, `q` is a string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` and `y1` are boolean variables. If `y1` is False, the loop has executed and `y0` is True if all characters of `p0` match `q` up to index `i`. If a character at index `i` is '?', and the character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` is set to False. If a character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` is set to False. `y1` will be False if any of the conditions inside the loop are met.***
