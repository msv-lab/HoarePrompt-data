Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1` is adjusted accordingly, `p1len` is an integer representing the length of `p0` but greater than the current value, `t` has intersection with `good_letters`, `q` is assigned the raw input value, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `y1` is True. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop.***
