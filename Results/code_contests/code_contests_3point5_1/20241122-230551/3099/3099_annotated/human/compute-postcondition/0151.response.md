Example Answer:
`p1len` is assigned the length of `p1`. The previous value of `p1` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `p1len`. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is the input value, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, and `p1len` is the length of `p1`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is the input value, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, and `p1len` is the length of `p1`**
