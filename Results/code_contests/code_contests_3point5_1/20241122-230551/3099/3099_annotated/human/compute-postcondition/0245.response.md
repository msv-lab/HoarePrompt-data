Postcondition: ***`p0`, `q` are strings, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0`, `y1` are booleans, `t` is a substring of `q`. If `p1len` is equal to 0, `t` is a substring of `q` starting from index `p0len`. If `p1len` is not equal to 0, `t` is a substring of `q` starting from index `p0len` and excluding the last `p1len` characters.***
