Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is a question mark '?', the program checks if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in the set `good_letters`. If not, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is in the set `good_letters`, no action is taken. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not a question mark '?', the program checks if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `q`. If they are not equal, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. If they are equal, no action is taken.***
