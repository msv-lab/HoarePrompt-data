Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p0`, `p0` is not empty and satisfies conditions for `y0`, there is no element '?' at index `i` in `p1`. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop.***
