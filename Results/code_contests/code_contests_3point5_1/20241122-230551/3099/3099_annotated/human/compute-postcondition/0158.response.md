Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `_` is 1, `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If the length of `q` is less than the length of `p` minus 1, then 'NO' is printed and the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
