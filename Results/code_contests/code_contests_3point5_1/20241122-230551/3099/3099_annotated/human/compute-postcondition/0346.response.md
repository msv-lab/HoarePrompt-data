Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is a list, `good_letters` is a set, `p1` is a list, `p1len` is an integer, `t` is a sublist of `q` starting from index `p0len` up to but not including index `-p1len`. The loop will break with 'NO' printed if any element at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if any element at index `i` in `p1` is not equal to '?' and not equal to the element at index `i` in `qr`. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute and the initial conditions remain unchanged. The length of the intersection of `t` and `good_letters` is greater than 0.***
