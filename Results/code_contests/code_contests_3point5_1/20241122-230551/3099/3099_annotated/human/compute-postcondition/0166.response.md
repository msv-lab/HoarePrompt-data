Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `_` is 1, `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is a boolean indicating if a character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is an index from 0 to `p0len`. The character at index `i` in `p0` is '?' and the character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`. If any character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y0` is set to False. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
