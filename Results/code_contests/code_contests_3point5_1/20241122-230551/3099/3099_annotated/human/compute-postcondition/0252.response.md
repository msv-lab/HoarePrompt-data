Postcondition: ***`p0`, `q` are strings, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0`, `y1` are booleans, `t` is a substring of `q`. If the intersection of characters in `t` and `good_letters` is not empty, the program prints 'YES'. This covers all scenarios where the program either prints 'YES' or continues without any changes to the initial state.***
