Postcondition: ***`p`, `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean that can be either True or False, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters, `i` is less than `plen`, `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, and `p[i]` is equal to `q[i`]. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is broken. All other variables remain in the precondition state.***
