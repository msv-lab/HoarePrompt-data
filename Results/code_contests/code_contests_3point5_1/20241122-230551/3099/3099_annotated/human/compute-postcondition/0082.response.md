Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This occurs when `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is False, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, and `i` is 1.***
