According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the key variables that need to be adjusted are `n` to be greater than 0, and `_` should be set to 1 as it represents the iteration in the loop. 
State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `_` is 1**
