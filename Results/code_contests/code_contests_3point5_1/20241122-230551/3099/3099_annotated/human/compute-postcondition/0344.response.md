Output State: **`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is a list of elements, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `p1` is a list of elements, `p1len` is an integer. The loop will either break with 'NO' printed due to certain conditions not being met, or it will continue running if `y1 == True` and all conditions are satisfied. `t` is a sublist of `q` starting from index `p0len` up to but not including index `-p1len`.**
