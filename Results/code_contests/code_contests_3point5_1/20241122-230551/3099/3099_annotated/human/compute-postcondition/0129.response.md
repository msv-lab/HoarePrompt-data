Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is either True or False, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is exited. This postcondition ensures that `y` reflects the outcome of the comparisons made in the if else block, and 'NO' is displayed if any condition is not met.***
