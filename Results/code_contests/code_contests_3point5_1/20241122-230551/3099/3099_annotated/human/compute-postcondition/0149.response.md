Example Answer:
`p1` is assigned the reversed version of the string `p1`. The previous values of the variables are known, so if `p1` was "hello", after execution it will be "olleh". Therefore, the Output State is: gls is a string, good_letters is a set containing unique characters from the string gls, plen is the length of an unknown string p, n is the input value, p0 is the substring of p before the '*', p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string.
Output State: **gls is a string, good_letters is a set containing unique characters from the string gls, plen is the length of an unknown string p, n is the input value, p0 is the substring of p before the '*', p1 is the reverse of the original p1 string**
