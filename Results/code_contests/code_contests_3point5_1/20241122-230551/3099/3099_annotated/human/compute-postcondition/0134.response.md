Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is either True or False based on whether `q[i]` is in `good_letters` or not, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters, `i` is less than `plen`, `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, and `p[i]` is equal to `q[i`]. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.***
