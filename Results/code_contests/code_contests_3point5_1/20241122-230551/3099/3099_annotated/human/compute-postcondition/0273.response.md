Postcondition: ***`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is a boolean. If any character at index `i` in `p0` is '?', the program checks if the corresponding character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`. If so, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If no such mismatch occurs, the program continues. Otherwise, if any character at index `i` in `p0` is not '?' and there is a mismatch with the corresponding character at index `i` in `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program handles all cases where there are mismatches between `p0` and `q`, updating the state of `y0` accordingly.***
