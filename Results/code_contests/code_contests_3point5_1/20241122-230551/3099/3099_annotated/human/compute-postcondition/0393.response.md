Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is a list with all elements in `good_letters`, `good_letters` is a set, `p1` is adjusted accordingly, `p1len` is an integer, `t` is adjusted to have an intersection with `good_letters` as 1, `q` is assigned the raw input value, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than `i+1`. If the character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. In both cases, the program state retains the initial values of the variables before the execution of the program fragment.***
