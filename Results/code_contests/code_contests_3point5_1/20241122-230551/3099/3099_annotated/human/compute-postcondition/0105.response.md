Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is True, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `q` is the entered string, and `qlen` holds the length of string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration. In all other cases where `qlen` is equal to `plen`, the program proceeds without printing anything.**
