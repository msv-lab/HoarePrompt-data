Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1` is adjusted accordingly, `p1len` is an integer representing the length of `p0`, `t` has intersection with `good_letters`, `q` is assigned the raw input value, `qlen` is the length of `q`. If the element at index `i` in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is a question mark and the element at the same index in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, `y1` is False. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is not a question mark and does not match the element at the same index in `qr`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False. Otherwise, `y1` remains True after the execution of the if else block.***
