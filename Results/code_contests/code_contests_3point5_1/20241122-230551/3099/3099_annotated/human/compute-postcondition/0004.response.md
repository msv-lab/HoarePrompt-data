Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the input value. The previous values of `gls`, `good_letters`, and `plen` are unknown, so the output state is: `gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is the input value.
Output State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is the input value**
