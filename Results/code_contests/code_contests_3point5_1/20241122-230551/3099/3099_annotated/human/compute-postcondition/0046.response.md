Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `i` is 2. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
