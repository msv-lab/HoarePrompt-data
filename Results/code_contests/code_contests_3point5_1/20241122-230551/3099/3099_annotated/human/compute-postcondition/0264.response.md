Output State: **`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is False, `y1` is a boolean, `t` is a substring of `q`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is within the range of `p0len`. The character at index `i` in `p0` is '?'. The character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`. The program prints 'NO'**
