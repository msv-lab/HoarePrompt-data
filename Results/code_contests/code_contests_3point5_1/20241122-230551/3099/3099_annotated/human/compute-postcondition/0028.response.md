According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `plen` is greater than 0. Since `plen` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`. `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `i` is 1**
