Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `_` is 1, `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is False when `p0[i]` does not match `q[i]` and the loop breaks, keeping the index `i` within the range 0 to `p0len + 1`.***
