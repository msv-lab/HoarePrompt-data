Postcondition: ***`p` is a string, `q` is a string, `y` is a boolean variable indicating whether the characters at corresponding indices in strings `p` and `q` are equal. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks. The rest of the variables retain their initial values.***
