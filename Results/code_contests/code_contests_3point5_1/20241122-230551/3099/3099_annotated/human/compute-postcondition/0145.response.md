According to the code, the loop can execute again if `qlen` is equal to `plen` and certain conditions are met within the loop body. At the end of the last iteration, if `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the loop does not execute. If the loop has executed up to this point, then the loop can execute again. So, the necessary adjustment in this case is to ensure that `qlen` is equal to `plen` for the loop to continue.
State: **If qlen is equal to plen, maintain the initial values of all variables**
