Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is True, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This encompasses all cases where `q[i]` is not in `good_letters` and ensures that `y` is False after the execution of the if statement.***
