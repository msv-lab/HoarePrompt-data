Example Answer: 
`q` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. The variables `gls`, `good_letters`, `plen`, and `n` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than 0**
