Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is a list with all elements in `good_letters`, `good_letters` is a set, `p1` is adjusted accordingly, `p1len` is an integer, `t` is adjusted to have intersection with `good_letters` as 0, `q` is assigned the raw input value, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, `y0` is True. The character at index `i` in `p0` is not '?'. The character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`.***
