Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is a list with all elements in `good_letters`, `good_letters` is a set, `p1` is adjusted accordingly, `p1len` is an integer, `t` is adjusted to have intersection with `good_letters` as 0, `q` is assigned the raw input value, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0. If the element at index `i` in `p0` is '?', and the element at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, then the program prints 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks. If the element at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the element at index `i` in `q`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks. If none of these conditions are met, `y0` remains True.***
