Example Answer:
The variable `y` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since the variables `gls`, `good_letters`, `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` are not affected by this assignment, their values remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`**
