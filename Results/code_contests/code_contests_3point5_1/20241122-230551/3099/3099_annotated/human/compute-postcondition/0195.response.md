Output State: **`y0` is a boolean variable indicating whether all characters of `p0` match `q` up to index `i`. If a character at index `i` in `p0` is '?', and the character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` is set to False. If a character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` is set to False. The loop terminates if any of these conditions are met. If `p0` is empty or the length of `p0` is 0, the loop does not execute and `y0` remains True.**
