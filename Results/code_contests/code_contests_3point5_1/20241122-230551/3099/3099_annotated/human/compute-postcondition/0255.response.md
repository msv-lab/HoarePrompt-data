Example Answer: 
`qlen` is assigned the length of the input string `q`, so `qlen` now holds the number of characters in the input string. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` and `y1` are booleans, `t` is a substring of `q`, and `qlen` is the length of `q`.
Output State: **`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` and `y1` are booleans, `t` is a substring of `q`, and `qlen` is the length of `q`**
