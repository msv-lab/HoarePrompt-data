Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer. If `plen` is not equal to `qlen`, the program prints 'NO' and continues. The loop iterates through each character at index `i` in string `p` and checks the conditions. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is '?', and the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in the list of good_letters, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the characters at index `i` of string `p` and string `q` are not equal, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The loop continues to iterate as long as `i` is less than `plen`. If the loop does not execute due to the initial condition of `plen` not being equal to `qlen`, the program prints 'NO' and `y` remains True.**
