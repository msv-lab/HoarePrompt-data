Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean. If the character at index 1 of string `q` is not in the list of good_letters, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.***
