Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p0`, `p0` is not empty and satisfies conditions for `y0`. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If this condition is met, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', the program checks if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. If this condition is true, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and exits the loop or if statement. In all other cases, the program continues to execute.***
