Postcondition: ***If qlen is not equal to plen, 'NO' is printed and the loop does not execute. If qlen is equal to plen and all characters of strings p and q have been compared without any mismatches or invalid characters, 'YES' is printed. If a character in p at index i is '?', and the corresponding character in q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all other cases where the loop continues, the initial values of the variables are maintained.***
