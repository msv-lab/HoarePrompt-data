Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `i` is less than `plen`. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. In all other cases, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the if else block. This postcondition ensures that the program responds correctly to different scenarios where the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q` do not match or where the character in `q` is not a good letter.***
