Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in the set of `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
