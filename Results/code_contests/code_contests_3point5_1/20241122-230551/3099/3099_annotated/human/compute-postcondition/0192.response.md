Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `_` is 1, `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is a boolean variable representing whether all characters of `p0` match `q` up to index `i`. If `p0[i]` is '?', `y0` becomes False and the loop breaks if the character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`. If `p0[i]` does not match `q[i]`, `y0` becomes False and the loop breaks while maintaining `i` within the range 0 to `p0len + 1. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is terminated.***
