Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`. If the length of string `q` is not equal to the length of string `p`, then 'NO' is printed and the program continues without any further changes to the variables.***
