Example Answer:
The variable `p` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes a user input. The values of `gls` and `good_letters` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`**
