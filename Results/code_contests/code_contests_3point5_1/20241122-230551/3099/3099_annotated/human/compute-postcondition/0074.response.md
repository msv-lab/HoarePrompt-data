According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `i` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, as it should be less than `plen` for the next iteration.
State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
