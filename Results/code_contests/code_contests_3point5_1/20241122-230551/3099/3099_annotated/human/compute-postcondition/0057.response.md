Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the state of the variables. It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is True, `qlen` is the length of string `q`.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is True, `qlen` is the length of string `q`**
