Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set with unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `i` is 2. If the character at index 2 of string `q` is not in the set `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y` to False, then breaks.***
