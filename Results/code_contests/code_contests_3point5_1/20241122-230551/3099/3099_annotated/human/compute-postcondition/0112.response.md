Postcondition: ***`p` is a string, `q` is a string, `y` is a boolean where False indicates a character in string `q` at index `i` is not in the list of good_letters. `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `q` is the entered string, `qlen` is equal to `plen`, and the character at index `i` in string `p` is '?'. If a character in `q` at index `i` is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False. A break statement is executed.***
