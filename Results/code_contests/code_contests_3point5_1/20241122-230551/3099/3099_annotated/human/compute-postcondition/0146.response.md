Output State: **If qlen is not equal to plen, 'NO' is printed and the loop does not execute. If qlen is equal to plen, the loop iterates through each character at index 'i' in strings p and q, comparing them. If there is a mismatch or a character in p is '?' and the corresponding character in q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. If all characters are successfully compared without any issues, 'YES' is printed.**
