Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'NO' to the console. The variables `p`, `q`, `y`, and `i` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `i` is less than `plen`.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `i` is less than `plen`**
