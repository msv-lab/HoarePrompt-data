Example Answer:
A set `good_letters` is created by iterating through each character `c` in the string `gls`. The set will contain unique characters from the string `gls`. Since the initial state of `gls` is a string, the set will contain unique characters from that string. 
Output State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`**
