Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `q`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. The loop breaks if the condition is met. The initial conditions remain unchanged, and all variables retain their original values.***
