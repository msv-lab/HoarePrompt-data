Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('NO')` simply prints 'NO' to the console and does not affect any of the existing variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
