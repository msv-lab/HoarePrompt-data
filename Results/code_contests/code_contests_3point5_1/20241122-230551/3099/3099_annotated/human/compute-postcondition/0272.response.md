Postcondition: ***`p0` is a string, `q` is the input string, `good_letters` is a set of characters, `y0` is a boolean that is False if any character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the corresponding character at index `i` in `q`, `y1` is a boolean, `t` is a substring of `q`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is within the range of `p0len`. The character at index `i` in `p0` is not '?' and if there is any mismatch between characters at the same index in `p0` and `q`, 'NO' is printed and `y0` is set to False. The program breaks after the first mismatch is encountered.***
