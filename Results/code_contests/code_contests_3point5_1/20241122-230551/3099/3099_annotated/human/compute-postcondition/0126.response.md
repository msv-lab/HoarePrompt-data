Example Answer:
The value of `y` is reassigned to False. The previous value of `y` was True. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `q` are strings, `y` is False, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is False, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters**
