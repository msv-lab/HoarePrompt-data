Postcondition: ***If y is True, then qlen is equal to plen, and each character of strings p and q has been compared. If a character in p at index i is '?', and the corresponding character in q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues with the initial values of the variables maintained.***
