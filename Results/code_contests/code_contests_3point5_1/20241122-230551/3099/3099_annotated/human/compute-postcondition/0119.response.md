Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean variable indicating the overall result, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters. If a character in `p` at index `i` is '?', then for the corresponding index in `q`, if the character is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks. In all other cases, the program continues with the initial values of the variables maintained.***
