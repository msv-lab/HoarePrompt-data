Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` in string `p` is a question mark '?'. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in the set `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. The program breaks at this point.***
