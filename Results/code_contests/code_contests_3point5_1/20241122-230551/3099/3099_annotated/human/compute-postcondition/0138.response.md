Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean that can be either True or False, `good_letters` is a list of valid characters, `i` is less than `plen`, `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, and `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is broken.***
