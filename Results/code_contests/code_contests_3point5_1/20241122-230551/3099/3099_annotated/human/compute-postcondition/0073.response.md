Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are strings, `y` is a boolean, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `plen` is a positive integer, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is '?', and the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in the list of good_letters, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the characters at index `i` of string `p` and string `q` are not equal, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all cases, the initial conditions remain intact, and the variables retain their original values.***
