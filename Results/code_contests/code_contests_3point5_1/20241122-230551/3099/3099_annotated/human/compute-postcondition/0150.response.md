Example Answer:
`p0len` is assigned the length of `p0`. The value of `p0` is unknown, so the value of `p0len` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is the input value, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string.
Output State: **`gls` is a string, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from the string `gls`, `plen` is the length of an unknown string `p`, `n` is the input value, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` is the reverse of the original `p1` string**
