The function takes input for three integers `W`, `a`, and `c`, calculates the values of `b` and `d` based on the input, then determines the value of `ans` according to specific conditions. If `b` is less than `c`, `ans` is set to `c - b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `d` is less than `a`, `ans` is `a - d`, which is a positive integer. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, `ans` is 0. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`.
