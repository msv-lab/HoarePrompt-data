Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved in order to connect with the first rectangle. The program handles all possible cases as per the problem constraints and logic provided. The variables `W`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `ans` are used appropriately to calculate the minimum distance. The program outputs the correct minimum distance as required. 

Therefore, based on the code analysis and the problem description, the program is correct and outputs the expected results for all cases.
