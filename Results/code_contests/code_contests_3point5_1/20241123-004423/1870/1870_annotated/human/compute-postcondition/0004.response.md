Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is calculated as `c - b`. Given that `b = a + W` and `d = c + W`, and `b` is less than `c`, it implies that `c - b` will result in a positive value. The exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `W`, `a`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state is: `W`, `a`, `c` are integers with unknown values, `b` is `a + W`, `d` is `c + W`, `b` is less than `c`, and `ans` is the result of `c - b`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c` are integers with unknown values, `b` is `a + W`, `d` is `c + W`, `b` is less than `c`, `ans` is the result of `c - b`**
