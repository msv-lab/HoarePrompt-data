Postcondition: ***`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, `d`, and `ans` are integers. `b` is equal to `a + W`, `d` is equal to `c + W`. If `b` is less than `c`, `ans` is the result of `c - b`. If `b` is equal to or greater than `c`, and `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is the result of `a - d`, which is a positive integer. If `d` is larger than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 0.***
