Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a - d`, where `a` is less than `d`. Since `d` is less than `a`, the value of `ans` will be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers. `b` is equal to or greater than `c`, `d` is equal to or greater than `b`, `d` is less than `a`, and `ans` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers. `b` is equal to or greater than `c`, `d` is equal to or greater than `b`, `d` is less than `a`, and `ans` is a positive integer**
