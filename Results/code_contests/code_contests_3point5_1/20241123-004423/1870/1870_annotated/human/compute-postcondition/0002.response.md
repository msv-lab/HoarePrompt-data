Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `c + W`, where `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with unknown values. The value of `b` is `a + W`, so `b` is dependent on `a` and `W`, and `d` is dependent on `c` and `W`. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with unknown values; `b` is `a + W`; `d` is `c + W`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with unknown values; `b` is `a + W`; `d` is `c + W`**
