Postcondition: ***`W`, `a`, `c` are integers within the specified range. `b` is the sum of `a + W`, `d` is the sum of `c + W`. If `b` is less than `c`, `ans` is the difference between `c` and `b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then if `d` is less than `a`, `ans` is `a - d`, otherwise `ans` is 0.***
