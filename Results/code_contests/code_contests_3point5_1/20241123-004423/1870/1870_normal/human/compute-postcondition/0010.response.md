Postcondition: ***`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, `d`, `ans` are integers within the specified range. `b` is the sum of `a + W`, `d` is the sum of `c + W`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is the result of `a - d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 0.***
