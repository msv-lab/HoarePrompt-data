Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers `W`, `a`, and `c` from the standard input. It then calculates values `b` and `d` by adding `W` to `a` and `c` respectively. If `b` is less than `c`, it computes the absolute difference between them and assigns it to `ans`. Otherwise, if `d` is less than `a`, it calculates `a - d` and assigns it to `ans`. If neither condition is met, `ans` is set to 0. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans` to the standard output. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
