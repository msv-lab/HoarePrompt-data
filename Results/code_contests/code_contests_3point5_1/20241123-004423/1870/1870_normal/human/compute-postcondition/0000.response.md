Example Answer:
`W`, `a`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers using `map`. The values of `W`, `a`, and `c` are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range**
