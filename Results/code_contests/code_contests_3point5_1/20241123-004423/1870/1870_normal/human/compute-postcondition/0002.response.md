Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value `c + W`, where `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range. The value of `b` is the sum of `a + W`. Since no specific values are given for `W`, `a`, and `c`, the output state is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`, and `d` is the sum of `c + W`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`, and `d` is the sum of `c + W`**
