Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value of `a + W`. Since `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, the sum of `a + W` is calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers within the specified range, `b` is the sum of `a + W`**
