Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads three integers `W`, `a`, and `c` from the standard input and calculates the values `b` and `d` by adding `W` to `a` and `c` respectively. It then checks the positions of the rectangles to determine the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved. If `b` is less than `c`, it calculates the absolute difference between them and assigns it to `ans`. If `d` is less than `a`, it computes `a - d` and assigns it to `ans`. If neither condition is met, `ans` is set to 0. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The logic in the code aligns with the problem statement, making it a correct solution.
