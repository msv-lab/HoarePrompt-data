Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the described method for converting an array of unsigned 8-bit integers into a sequence of characters using the Turing Tape method.

Here is a case where the program does not work as expected:
Input: "Hello!"
Expected Output: 
238
108
112
0
64
194
48
26
244
168
24
16

Actual Output:
238
108
112
0
64
194
48
26
244
168
24

The program is missing the last step in the process of converting the array back into integers to produce the text. It should reverse the binary notation of the result and convert it back to an integer to get the ASCII code of the character.
