Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue is with the calculation of the integer value from the reversed binary representation of the ASCII code of the character. The program is calculating the difference between the previous integer value and the current integer value, which is not the correct step in the process described in the problem.

Additionally, the program is missing the step where the binary notation of the result needs to be reversed again to produce the ASCII code of the character to be printed.

Therefore, the program does not produce the correct output according to the problem description.
