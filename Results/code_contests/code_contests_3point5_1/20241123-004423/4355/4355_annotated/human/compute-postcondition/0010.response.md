Output State: **`table` is unchanged, `input` has at least one more character, `prev` is the integer value of the new `binary` in base 2, `c` is the next character in the `input` string, `s` is the formatted binary representation of the ASCII value of the new `c` with leading zeros to make it 8 bits long, `binary` is the reverse of the new `s`, `integer` is the integer value of the new `binary` in base 2, and the result of the code is printed as `(prev - integer) % 256`**
