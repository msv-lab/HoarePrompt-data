According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input string. As long as there are characters remaining in the input string, the loop will continue to execute. Since all variables remain unchanged at the end of the previous iteration, no adjustments need to be made to the states for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **All variables remain unchanged**
