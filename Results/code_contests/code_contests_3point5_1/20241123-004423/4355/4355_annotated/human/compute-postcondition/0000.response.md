Example Answer: 
The dictionary `table` is defined with key-value pairs mapping specific characters to integer values. Each key represents a specific character, and the corresponding value represents an integer assigned to that character. The dictionary `table` is initialized with the mappings: '>' to 8, '<' to 9, '+' to 10, '-' to 11, '.' to 12, ',' to 13, '[' to 14, and ']' to 15. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **The dictionary `table` is initialized with mappings: '>' to 8, '<' to 9, '+' to 10, '-' to 11, '.' to 12, ',' to 13, '[' to 14, ']' to 15**
