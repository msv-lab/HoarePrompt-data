Output State: **The loop processes each character in the input string, converts it to its binary representation, calculates the difference between the previous binary value and the current binary value, takes the result modulo 256, and prints it. The variables `table`, `input`, and `prev` remain unchanged throughout the loop. If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute, and `prev` remains 0.**
