Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user, processes each character by converting it to binary, calculating the difference between consecutive binary values, taking the result modulo 256, and printing it. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have explicit return values. It verifies if the input text meets the specified constraints but does not explicitly handle cases where input text length is outside the range of 1 to 100 characters or where ASCII codes of characters are not within the range of 32 to 126.**
