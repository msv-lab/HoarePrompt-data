The function verifies if the input text meets the specified constraints: the input text is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, and the ASCII-code of each character in the text is between 32 and 126, inclusive. The function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to verify if the input text meets the specified constraints.
