Example Answer: 
The variable `integer` is assigned the integer value of the binary string represented by the variable `binary`. The `binary` string is converted to an integer using base 2 conversion. Since all variables remain unchanged, the output state is: All variables remain unchanged, `integer` is the integer value of the binary string.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, `integer` is the integer value of the binary string**
