According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string. If there are more characters in the input string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain unchanged, and `prev` is the integer value of the binary string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the input string must have more characters.
State: **All variables remain unchanged, `prev` is the integer value of the binary string, input has more characters**
