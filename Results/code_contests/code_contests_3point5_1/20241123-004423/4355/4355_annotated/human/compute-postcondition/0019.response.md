Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of (prev - integer) % 256 and prints it. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `prev` and `integer`, we cannot determine the exact output value, but the result will be within the range of 0 to 255 due to the modulo operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain unchanged, `integer` is the integer value of the binary string.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, `integer` is the integer value of the binary string**
