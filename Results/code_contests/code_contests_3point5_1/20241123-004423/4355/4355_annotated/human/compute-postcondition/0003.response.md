According to the code, the loop can execute if the `input` string is not empty. Before the loop starts, the `input` string being assigned the value of user input does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted such that the `input` string is not empty and `c` is the first character in the `input` string.
State: **`table` is initialized with mappings: '>' to 8, '<' to 9, '+' to 10, '-' to 11, '.' to 12, ',' to 13, '[' to 14, ']' to 15; `input` is assigned the value of the user input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character in the `input` string**
