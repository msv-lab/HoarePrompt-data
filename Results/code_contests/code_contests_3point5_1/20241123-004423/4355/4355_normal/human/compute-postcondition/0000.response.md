Example Answer:
The dictionary `table` is initialized with key-value pairs where each key is a character symbol and the corresponding value is an integer. The dictionary `table` now contains the mappings: '>' -> 8, '<' -> 9, '+' -> 10, '-' -> 11, '.' -> 12, ',' -> 13, '[' -> 14, ']' -> 15.
Output State: **table is a dictionary containing mappings: '>' -> 8, '<' -> 9, '+' -> 10, '-' -> 11, '.' -> 12, ',' -> 13, '[' -> 14, ']' -> 15**
