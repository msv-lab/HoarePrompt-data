Output State: 
- `table` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `s` is the binary representation of the ASCII value of character `c` padded to 8 bits.
- `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
- `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2.
- The program prints the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256.
- If the input is empty, the loop does not execute, and `prev` remains 0.
