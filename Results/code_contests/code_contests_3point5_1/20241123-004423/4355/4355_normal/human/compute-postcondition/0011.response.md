Example Answer:
The variable `binary` is assigned the reversed string of `s`. The value of `s` is unknown, but after this assignment, `binary` will hold the reversed version of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: table, s, binary (reversed version of s), integer, and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 are updated based on the next character `c` in the input.
Output State: **table, s, binary (reversed version of s), integer, and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 are updated based on the next character `c` in the input**
