At the end of the previous iteration, the states are updated based on the character `c` in the input. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in the input will update the states. Specifically, table, s, binary (reversed version of s), integer (integer representation of the reversed version of s), and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 will need to be adjusted based on the next character `c` in the input.
State: **table, s, binary (reversed version of s), integer (integer representation of the reversed version of s), and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 are updated based on the next character `c` in the input**
