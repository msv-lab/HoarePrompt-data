According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one character in the input. Since we don't have information about the input variable, we need to ensure that it is not empty for the loop to execute. Additionally, before the loop starts, prev is 0, which does not affect the loop execution but is important to maintain for later stages. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `table` is a dictionary containing mappings: '>' -> 8, '<' -> 9, '+' -> 10, '-' -> 11, '.' -> 12, ',' -> 13, '[' -> 14, ']' -> 15, `prev` is 0, and `input` is not empty.
State: **table is a dictionary containing mappings: '>' -> 8, '<' -> 9, '+' -> 10, '-' -> 11, '.' -> 12, ',' -> 13, '[' -> 14, ']' -> 15, prev is 0, input is not empty**
