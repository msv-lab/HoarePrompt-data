Example Answer:
`integer` is assigned the integer value of `binary` in base 2. The value of `binary` is the reversed version of `s`, so `integer` is the integer representation of the reversed version of `s`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **table, s, binary (reversed version of s), integer (integer representation of the reversed version of s), and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 are updated based on the next character `c` in the input**
