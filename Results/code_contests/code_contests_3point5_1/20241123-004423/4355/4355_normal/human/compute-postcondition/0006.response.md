Example Answer:
`integer` is assigned the integer value of `binary` in base 2. The value of `binary` is the reverse of `s`, which is the binary representation of the ASCII value of character `c` padded to 8 bits. Since the values of `s` and `c` are not provided in the initial state, the output state will be as follows:
Output State: **table is a dictionary containing mappings: '>' -> 8, '<' -> 9, '+' -> 10, '-' -> 11, '.' -> 12, ',' -> 13, '[' -> 14, ']' -> 15, prev is 0, input is not empty, s is the binary representation of the ASCII value of character `c` padded to 8 bits, binary is the reverse of s, integer is the integer value of binary in base 2**
