Example Answer:
The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`, where `integer` is updated based on the binary representation of `s`. The previous value of `prev` is unknown, so the output state is: `table`, `s`, `binary` remain the same, `integer` is updated based on the binary representation of `s`, `prev` is an unknown value.
Output State: **`table`, `s`, `binary` remain the same, `integer` is updated based on the binary representation of `s`, `prev` is an unknown value**
