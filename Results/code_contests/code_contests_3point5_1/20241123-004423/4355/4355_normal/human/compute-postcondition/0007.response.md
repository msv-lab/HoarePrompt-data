Example Answer:
After executing the code snippet, the program prints the result of subtracting the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the ASCII value of character `c` from the value of `prev` modulo 256. Since the initial state specifies the mappings for various characters and the values of `prev`, `input`, `s`, `binary`, and `integer`, we can calculate the result accordingly.
Output State: **table is a dictionary containing mappings: '>' -> 8, '<' -> 9, '+' -> 10, '-' -> 11, '.' -> 12, ',' -> 13, '[' -> 14, ']' -> 15, prev is 0, input is not empty, s is the binary representation of the ASCII value of character `c` padded to 8 bits, binary is the reverse of s, integer is the integer value of binary in base 2, and the program prints the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256**
