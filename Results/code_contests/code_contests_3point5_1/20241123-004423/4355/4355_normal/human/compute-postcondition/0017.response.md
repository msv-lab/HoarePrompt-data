Example Answer:
The variable `binary` is assigned the reversed version of the string `s`. This means the order of characters in `s` is reversed and stored in `binary`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`table`, `s`, `binary` is the reversed version of `s`, `integer`, and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 are updated based on the next character `c` in the input**
