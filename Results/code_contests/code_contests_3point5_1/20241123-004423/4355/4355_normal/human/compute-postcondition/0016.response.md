Example Answer:
The variable `s` is updated by formatting the binary representation of the ASCII value of character `c` with leading zeros to make it 8 characters long. The values of `table`, `binary`, `integer`, and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 are updated based on the new character `c`. 
Output State: **`table`, `s`, `binary`, `integer`, and the result of `prev - integer` modulo 256 are updated based on the next character `c` in the input**
