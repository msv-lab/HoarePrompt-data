Example Answer:
`prev` is subtracted by `integer` and then the result is taken modulo 256. The value of `prev` is unknown, but `integer` is updated based on the binary representation of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `table`, `s`, `binary` remain the same, `integer` is updated based on the binary representation of `s`.
Output State: **`table`, `s`, `binary` remain the same, `integer` is updated based on the binary representation of `s`**
