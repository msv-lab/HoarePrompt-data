The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, processes each character in the input by converting it to its binary representation, calculating the integer value, and then printing the result of the subtraction of the current integer value from the previous one modulo 256. If the input is empty, the function does not execute the loop, and the final `prev` value remains 0.
