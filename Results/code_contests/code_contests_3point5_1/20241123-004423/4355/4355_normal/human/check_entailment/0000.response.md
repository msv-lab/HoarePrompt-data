Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not handle the case where the input is empty. The final value of `prev` will remain 0 in this case, which is not considered in the output. Additionally, the code does not correctly calculate the result of the subtraction of the current integer value from the previous one modulo 256. The expression `print(prev - integer) % 256` should be `print((prev - integer) % 256)` to calculate the modulo correctly.
