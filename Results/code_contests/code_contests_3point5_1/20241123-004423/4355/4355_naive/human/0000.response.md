Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly follows the problem description by processing each character of the input text and producing the initial array as expected. The program reverses the binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character, subtracts the current character's ASCII-code, and prints the result modulo 256. The program repeats this process for every character in the input text, resulting in the restoration of the initial array used to produce the text. Since the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
