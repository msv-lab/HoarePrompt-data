Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not align with the problem description for every potential case. 

For the input "30 of month", the code incorrectly calculates and prints the result. The code should output 11, as Limak wants to save one candy on the 30th day of each month, which occurs in 11 months of the year 2016. However, the code does not handle this case correctly and does not produce the expected output. 

Therefore, based on the discrepancy between the code output and the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed false.
