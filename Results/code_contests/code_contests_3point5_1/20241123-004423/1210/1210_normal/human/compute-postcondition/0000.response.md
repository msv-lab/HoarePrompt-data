Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input provided. Since the input format is specified to be either "x of week" or "x of month" where x is within a certain range, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **Precondition**: **The input format is either "x of week" where x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 7, or "x of month" where x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 31.**
