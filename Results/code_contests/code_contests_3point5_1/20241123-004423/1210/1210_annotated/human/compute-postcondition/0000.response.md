Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the input string. The input can be either "x of week" or "x of month", where x is an integer representing a day of the week (1 to 7) or a day of the month (1 to 31). Therefore, the output state is `s` is the input string containing either "x of week" or "x of month".
Output State: **`s` is the input string containing either "x of week" or "x of month"**
