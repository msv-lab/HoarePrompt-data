Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. It misses out on the cases where Limak wants to save candies on multiple days of the week or month. The program only accounts for saving candies on a single day of the week or month. 

For example, if the input is "1 of week" meaning Limak wants to save candies on Monday, the program will not be able to calculate the total number of candies saved throughout the year correctly. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all the possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description.
