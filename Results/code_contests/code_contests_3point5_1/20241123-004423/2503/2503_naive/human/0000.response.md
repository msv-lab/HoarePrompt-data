Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point based on the given initial coordinates, destination coordinates, weather forecast, and the rules of movement for the ship. It considers all possible scenarios and edge cases, such as when the ship stays in place, when the ship reaches the destination early, and when the ship needs to cycle through the weather forecast multiple times to reach the destination. The logic in the program covers all the requirements mentioned in the problem description.
