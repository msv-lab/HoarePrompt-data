Example Answer:
The variables `x1` and `y1` are updated by adding the product of `cycles` and the last elements of `pref_sums` to their previous values. The values of `x1` and `y1` are affected by the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `cycles`, and `pref_sums`. Therefore, the output state is: `cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`, `res` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `cycles`; `x1` and `y1` are updated.
Output State: **`cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`, `res` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `cycles`; `x1` and `y1` are updated**
