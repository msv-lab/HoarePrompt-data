Example Answer:
A 2D list `pref_sums` is created with n number of rows, each containing [0, 0]. The values of x1, y1, x2, y2 are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: x1, y1, x2, y2 are coordinates, pref_sums is a 2D list with n rows, each containing [0, 0].
Output State: **x1, y1, x2, y2 are coordinates, pref_sums is a 2D list with n rows, each containing [0, 0]**
