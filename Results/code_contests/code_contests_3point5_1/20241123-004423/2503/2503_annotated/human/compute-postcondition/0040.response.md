Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1` are updated at each iteration, `pref_sums` may be updated, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'D', `u` is set to -1, and `r` remains 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'R', `r` is set to 1. This ensures that all variables are correctly updated and the conditions are met after the execution of the if statement.***
