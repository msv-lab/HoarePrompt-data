Output State: **`cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`, `res` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `cycles`; `x1` and `y1` are updated. The absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n` multiplied by `cycles` is less than or equal to 0**
