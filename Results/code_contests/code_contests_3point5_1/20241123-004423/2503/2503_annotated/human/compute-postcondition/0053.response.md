According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x1`, `y1`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `n`, `s`, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are appropriately updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `n+1`**
