According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `x1`, `y1`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `n`, `s`, `u`, `r`, `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` are appropriately updated based on the conditions of the program. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and all other variables should remain the same unless explicitly stated in the loop body. 
State: **`x1`, `y1`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `n`, `s`, `u`, `r`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are all appropriately updated, `i` is incremented by 1**
