According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `min_dist`, `moves_toward`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, `i` are the current values. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `min_dist`, `moves_toward`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, `i+1`**
