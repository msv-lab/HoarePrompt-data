Output State: **`x1`, `y1` are updated at each iteration, `pref_sums` is updated based on the calculation `pref_sums[i] = [pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u]`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'D', `u` is set to -1, and `r` remains 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'R', `r` is set to 1. After the execution of the if statement, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'L', `r` is assigned the value -1.**
