According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2 because the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. 

Before the loop starts, the values that need to be adjusted are:
- `x1` is updated to the new_x calculated value at the beginning of each iteration of the loop.
- `y1` is updated to the new_y calculated value at the beginning of each iteration of the loop.
- `pref_sums` may need to be updated based on the operations inside the loop.
- `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist` at the beginning of each iteration of the loop.

State: **`x1` is updated at each iteration, `y1` is updated at each iteration, `pref_sums` may be updated, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
