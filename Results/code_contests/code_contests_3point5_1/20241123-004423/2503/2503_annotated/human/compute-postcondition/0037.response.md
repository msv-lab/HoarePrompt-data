Postcondition: ***At each iteration, `x1` and `y1` are updated, `pref_sums` may be updated, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'D', `u` is set to -1, and `r` remains 0. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if statement.***
