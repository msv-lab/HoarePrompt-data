The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters explicitly. Within the function, there are multiple cases to handle the movement of a ship from initial coordinates (x1, y1) to destination coordinates (x2, y2) based on a given string of directions `s`. The function contains multiple cases to determine the movement and distance traveled by the ship, with different conditions and outcomes for each case. The function handles scenarios where the ship reaches the destination, calculates distances traveled, and prints or returns specific values based on the conditions met during the movement. The function also updates the coordinates and distances as the ship moves according to the given directions in the string `s`. The function terminates under certain conditions and does not return any value in some cases. Overall, the function `func_2` simulates the movement of a ship based on the provided directions and coordinates, with specific outcomes based on the distance traveled and reaching the destination.
Functionality: **The function simulates the movement of a ship from initial to destination coordinates based on a string of directions. It calculates distances traveled, prints specific values under certain conditions, and terminates the program accordingly.**
