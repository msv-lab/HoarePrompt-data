Example Answer:
The result `res` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `cycles`. The value of `cycles` is determined by the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`. The variables `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `min_dist`, and `moves_toward` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `cycles` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`, `res` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `cycles`.
Output State: **`cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`, `res` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `cycles`**
