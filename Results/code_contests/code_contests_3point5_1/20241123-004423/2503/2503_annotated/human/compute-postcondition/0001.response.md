Example Answer:
x2 and y2 are assigned the coordinates provided by the input after splitting the input. The previous values of x2 and y2 are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: x1 and y1 are the coordinates of the ship; x2 and y2 are the new coordinates provided by the input.
Output State: **x1 and y1 are the coordinates of the ship; x2 and y2 are the new coordinates provided by the input**
