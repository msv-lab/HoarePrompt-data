According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `x1`, `y1`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `n`, `s`, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are appropriately updated, `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the previous iteration, which is 2.
State: **`x1`, `y1`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `n`, `s`, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are appropriately updated, `i` is 2, `i` is less than `n+1`, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
