Example Answer:
The new coordinates `new_x` and `new_y` are calculated by adding the values from `pref_sums[i]` to `x1` and `y1` respectively. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[i]` are known. Therefore, the output state is: `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `min_dist`, `moves_toward` are all calculated values or variables, `n` is greater than 0, `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles) <= 0` is false, and new coordinates `new_x` and `new_y` are calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `min_dist`, `moves_toward` are all calculated values or variables, `n` is greater than 0, `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles) <= 0` is false, `new_x` and `new_y` are calculated based on the given formula**
