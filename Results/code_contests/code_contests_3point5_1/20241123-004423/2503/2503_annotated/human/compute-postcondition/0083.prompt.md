You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: 

- x1 and y1 are non-negative integers representing the initial coordinates of the ship.
- x2 and y2 are non-negative integers representing the destination coordinates of the ship.
- n is a positive integer representing the length of the string s.
- s is a string of length n, consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *x1, y1, x2, y2 are coordinates. If x1 is equal to x2 and y1 is equal to y2, the program prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, there is no further action.

Case_2: *`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are coordinates. `pref_sums` is a 2D list with n rows, each containing [r, u]. If the first character of string `s` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1, otherwise `u` remains 0. The value of `r` is now -1 if the first character of string `s` is 'L', 1 if the first character of string `s` is 'R', otherwise `r` remains 0. `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + r` and `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + u`. `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

Case_3: After the loop executes, `x1`, `y1`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `n`, `s`, `u`, `r`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are appropriately updated based on the conditions of the program. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'D', `u` is set to -1, and `r` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'R', `r` is set to 1. After the execution of the if statement, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'L', `r` is assigned the value -1. The new values of `x1` and `y1` are determined by adding the respective components of `pref_sums[i]`. The variable `dist` is then calculated as the absolute difference between the new values of `x1` and `y1` and the values of `x2` and `y2`, respectively, minus `i - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `i + 1` and returns. This summary covers all possible edge cases and the resulting state of the program after the if-else block executes.

Case_4: *`moves_toward`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `n`, and `i` are integers. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and terminates. There are no changes to the values of the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `n`, or `i`.

Case_5: *`cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `min_dist`, `moves_toward` are all calculated values or variables. If `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles) <= 0`, the program prints `res` and returns. Otherwise, no action is taken.

Case_6: The loop iterates through the range of n, calculating new_x and new_y based on pref_sums. It then computes dist and checks if it is less than or equal to 0. If true, it prints res + i + 1 and exits the loop. If the condition is never met, no action is taken.

Case_7: The program does not return any value

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
