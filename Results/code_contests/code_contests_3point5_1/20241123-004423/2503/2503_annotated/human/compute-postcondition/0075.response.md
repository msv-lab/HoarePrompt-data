Postcondition: ***`cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `min_dist`, `moves_toward`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are all calculated values or variables. `n` is greater than 0 and `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles) <= 0` is false. `dist` is calculated based on the provided formula. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res + i + 1` and ends. This covers all cases including edge cases where the calculated values are maintained and the condition for printing the result is satisfied.***
