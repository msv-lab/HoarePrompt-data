Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are coordinates. `pref_sums` is a 2D list with n rows, each containing [r, u]. If the first character of string `s` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1, otherwise `u` remains 0. The value of `r` is now -1 if the first character of string `s` is 'L', 1 if the first character of string `s` is 'R', otherwise `r` remains 0. `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + r` and `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + u`.**
