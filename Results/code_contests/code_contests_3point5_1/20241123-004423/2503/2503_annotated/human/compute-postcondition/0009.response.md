Example Answer: 
Variables `u` and `r` are both assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `u` and `r` are unknown, so the output state is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are coordinates, `pref_sums` is a 2D list with n rows, each containing [0, 0], `u` is 0, `r` is 0.
Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are coordinates, `pref_sums` is a 2D list with n rows, each containing [0, 0], `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
