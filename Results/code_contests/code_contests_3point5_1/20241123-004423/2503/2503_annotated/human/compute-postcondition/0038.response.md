Postcondition: ***At each iteration, `x1` and `y1` are updated, `pref_sums` may be updated, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'D', `u` is set to -1, and `r` remains 0. After the execution of the if statement, the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'R', `u` remains 0, and `r` is set to 1.***
