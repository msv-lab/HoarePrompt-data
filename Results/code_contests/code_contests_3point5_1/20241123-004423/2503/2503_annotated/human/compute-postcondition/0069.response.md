According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. The condition `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles) <= 0` will determine if the loop executes or not. If this condition is not met, the loop will continue. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0 and the condition `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles) <= 0` is false to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `min_dist`, `moves_toward` are all calculated values or variables, `n` is greater than 0, `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles) <= 0` is false**
