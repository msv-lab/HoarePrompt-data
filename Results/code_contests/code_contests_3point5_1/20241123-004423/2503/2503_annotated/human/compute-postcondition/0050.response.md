Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `n`, `s`, `u`, `r`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are all appropriately updated based on the conditions of the program. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'D', `u` is set to -1, and `r` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'R', `r` is set to 1. After the execution of the if statement, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is 'L', `r` is assigned the value -1. The new values of `x1` and `y1` are determined by adding the respective components of `pref_sums[i]`. The variable `dist` is then calculated as the absolute difference between the new values of `x1` and `y1` and the values of `x2` and `y2`, respectively, minus `i - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `i + 1` and returns. This summary covers all possible edge cases and the resulting state of the program after the if else block executes.***
