Functionality: The function `func_2` reads input for coordinates and directions, simulates a ship's movement based on the directions provided, calculates distances traveled, and prints specific values under certain conditions. It handles cases where the ship reaches the destination immediately, moves towards the destination but does not reach it, and has to cycle multiple times to reach the destination. The program accounts for various directions and terminates accordingly. It does not return any value in the end.
