The function accepts two non-negative integers x and y and calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y using the Euclidean algorithm. It continuously updates the values of x and y until y becomes 0, and then returns the final value of x as the greatest common divisor. If y is initially 0, the function returns x as the greatest common divisor.
