Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point (x2, y2) based on the wind forecast and ship movements. It covers all possible scenarios and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. The program calculates the required number of days accurately and handles cases where the ship cannot reach the destination point by returning -1. The implementation of the functions and the overall logic of the program align with the problem requirements.
