Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the initial coordinates of the ship, the destination coordinates, the length of the string, and the string itself.
2. It calculates the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point based on the wind directions.
3. The program handles cases where it is impossible for the ship to reach the destination point and prints "-1" in such scenarios.
4. The logic of calculating the number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point seems to be correct based on the provided problem description.
5. The program covers various scenarios such as the ship staying in place, moving in different directions based on the wind, and calculating the minimum days needed accurately.
6. Overall, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
