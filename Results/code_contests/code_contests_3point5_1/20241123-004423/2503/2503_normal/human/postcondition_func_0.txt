The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial `x` and `y`. It achieves this by iteratively updating `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. If the initial value of `y` is 0, the loop won't execute and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. The function returns the GCD of the initial `x` and `y`.
