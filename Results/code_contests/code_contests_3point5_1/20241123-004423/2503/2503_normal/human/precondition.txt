**Precondition**: 
- x_1 and y_1 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x_1, y_1 ≤ 10^9.
- x_2 and y_2 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x_2, y_2 ≤ 10^9 and (x_1, y_1) ≠ (x_2, y_2).
- n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- The string s consists of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.
