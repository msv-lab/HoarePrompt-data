The function `func_2` reads input for coordinates, a string, and an integer. It then processes the input based on specific conditions and calculates various values related to movements. The function handles cases where the coordinates are the same, prints 0, and returns, as well as cases where the coordinates differ. It involves operations on the input string and calculates distances based on movements. The function prints certain values based on conditions, such as when distances are less than or equal to 0, and handles scenarios involving cycles and movements towards a specific direction. Overall, the function performs calculations and prints results based on the input parameters and defined conditions.
