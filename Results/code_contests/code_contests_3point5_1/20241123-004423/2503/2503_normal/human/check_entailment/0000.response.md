Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the ship can never reach the destination point. For example, if the ship is at (0,0) and the destination point is (0,1), and the wind direction is 'L', the ship will never reach the destination. The code should output "-1" in such cases, but it does not. This discrepancy shows that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
