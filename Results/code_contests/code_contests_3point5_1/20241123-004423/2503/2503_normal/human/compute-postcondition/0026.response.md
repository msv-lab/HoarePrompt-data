Output State: **x1, y1, n are non-negative integers, s is a string of length n consisting of only U, D, L, and R. If (x1, y1) != (x2, y2), r is assigned the value -1. In case (x1, y1) == (x2, y2), the program prints 0 and returns. n is an input integer. pref_sums is a 2D list of size n with all elements initialized to [0, 0]. If the first character of string s is 'U' or 'D', then u is assigned the value -1 and r is 0. If the first character of string s is 'R', then r is assigned the value 1. After the execution of the if part, where s[0] == 'L', the program state remains the same as the precondition with the additional change of r being assigned the value -1, and pref_sums[0] is updated to [r, u]. new_x is assigned the value x1 + r, and new_y is assigned the value y1 + u. dist is calculated as the absolute difference between new_x - x2 and new_y - y2, then subtracting 1 from it.**
