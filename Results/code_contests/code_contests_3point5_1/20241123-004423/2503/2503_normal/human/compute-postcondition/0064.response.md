Example Answer:
The variables `x1` and `y1` are both updated based on the formula provided, taking into account the values of `x1`, `y1`, `cycles`, and `pref_sums`. The value of `res` is not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `moves_toward` is an integer and either prints -1 and returns or remains unchanged if greater than 0; `cycles` is calculated based on the formula if `moves_toward` is greater than 0; `res` is assigned the value of `n * cycles`; `x1` and `y1` are updated values based on the given formula.
