Output State: **`moves_toward` is an integer and either prints -1 and returns or remains unchanged if greater than 0; `cycles` is calculated based on the formula if `moves_toward` is greater than 0; `res` is assigned the value of `n * cycles`; `x1` and `y1` are updated values based on the given formula. The absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` subtracted by `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0.**
