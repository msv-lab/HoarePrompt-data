Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `n * cycles`, where `cycles` is calculated based on the formula if `moves_toward` is greater than 0. The value of `moves_toward` is an integer and either prints -1 and returns or remains unchanged if greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `moves_toward` is an integer and either prints -1 and returns or remains unchanged if greater than 0; `cycles` is calculated based on the formula if `moves_toward` is greater than 0; `res` is assigned the value of `n * cycles`.
Output State: **`moves_toward` is an integer and either prints -1 and returns or remains unchanged if greater than 0; `cycles` is calculated based on the formula if `moves_toward` is greater than 0; `res` is assigned the value of `n * cycles`**.
