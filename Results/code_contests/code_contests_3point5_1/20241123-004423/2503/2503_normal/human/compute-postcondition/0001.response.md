Example Answer: 
The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned by mapping the input to integers. The input is assumed to be in the format of two integers separated by a space. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `x2` and `y2`, the output state after this code snippet is: `x1, y1` are non-negative integers such that (x1, y1) != (x2, y2), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R, `x2` and `y2` are the input integers from user input.
Output State: **`x1, y1` are non-negative integers such that (x1, y1) != (x2, y2), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R, `x2` and `y2` are the input integers from user input**
