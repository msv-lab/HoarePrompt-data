According to the code, the loop will execute for the next iteration if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `n` are integers and the condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles` is satisfied. `new_x` and `new_y` have specific integer values, and `dist` is calculated as described. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the result of 'res + i + 1'.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
