Example Answer:
`x1, y1` are assigned values based on the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are now determined by the input provided. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `x1, y1` are non-negative integers such that (x1, y1) != (x2, y2), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R.
Output State: **`x1, y1` are non-negative integers such that (x1, y1) != (x2, y2), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R**.
