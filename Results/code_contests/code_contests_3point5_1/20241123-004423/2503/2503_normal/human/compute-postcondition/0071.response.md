Example Answer:
The variable `dist` is calculated based on the absolute difference between `new_x` and `x2`, `new_y` and `y2`, subtracting `i`, `n * cycles`, and 1. The values of `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, `y2`, `i`, `n`, `cycles` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `n` are integers, condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles` is satisfied, `new_x` and `new_y` have specific integer values, `dist` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `n` are integers, condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles` is satisfied, `new_x` and `new_y` have specific integer values, `dist` is calculated as described**
