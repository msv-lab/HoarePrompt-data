Example Answer:
`new_x` and `new_y` are assigned the values of `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]` respectively. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[i][0]`, `pref_sums[i][1]` are known integers. Therefore, after execution, `new_x` and `new_y` will have specific integer values based on the calculation. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `n` are integers, condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles` is satisfied, `new_x` and `new_y` have specific integer values**
