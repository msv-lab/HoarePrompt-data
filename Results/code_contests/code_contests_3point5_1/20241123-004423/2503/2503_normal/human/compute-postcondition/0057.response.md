Output State: 
- All variables retain their respective values after each iteration of the loop. 
- If `dist` is less than or equal to 0 at any point during the loop execution, the program prints the value of `i + 1` and returns. 
- If the first character of string `s` is 'U' or 'D', `u` is assigned the value -1 and `r` is 0. 
- If the first character of string `s` is 'R', `r` is assigned the value 1. 
- After the execution of the if part where `s[0] == 'L'`, the program state remains the same as the precondition, with the additional change of `r` being assigned the value -1 and `pref_sums[0]` updated to `[r, u]`. 
- `new_x` is assigned the value `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, and `new_y` is assigned the value `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`.
- The variable `moves_toward` is calculated based on the given formula involving `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `new_x`, `new_y`, and `n`.
Output State: **All variables retain their respective values, with the specified conditions and calculations taken into account.**
