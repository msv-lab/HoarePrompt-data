You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
eturn str
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns string 'str'**


Example2:
Initial State: A is a matrix n x m
```
return A
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns the n x m sized matrix A**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
return n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the program returns either 4 or 6.
Output State: **The program returns 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `z` is 0
```
retrun y+x
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`y' is 0 and 'x' is one so the program returns  0+1=1.
Output State: **`The program returns 1**

xample4:
Initial State: `count' contains the number of numbers greater than 1 in the list `numbers`, 'numbers' is a list of integers, 'total' is 0
```
retrun count
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
Output State: **`The program returns the number of integers greater than 1 in list 'numbers' **


Your Task:
Initial State: x1, y1, n are non-negative integers, s is a string of length n consisting of only U, D, L, and R. If (x1, y1) != (x2, y2), r is assigned the value -1. In case (x1, y1) == (x2, y2), the program prints 0 and returns. n is an input integer. pref_sums is a 2D list of size n with all elements initialized to [0, 0]. If the first character of string s is 'U' or 'D', then u is assigned the value -1 and r is 0. If the first character of string s is 'R', then r is assigned the value 1. After the execution of the if part, where s[0] == 'L', the program state remains the same as the precondition with the additional change of r being assigned the value -1, and pref_sums[0] is updated to [r, u]. new_x is assigned the value x1 + r, and new_y is assigned the value y1 + u. dist is calculated as the absolute difference between new_x - x2 and new_y - y2, then subtracting 1 from it.
```
return

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
