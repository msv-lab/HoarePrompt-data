Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `n` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only U, D, L, and R, `(x1, y1) != (x2, y2)`, `r` is assigned -1, `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size `n` with all elements initialized to [0, 0], if the first character of string `s` is 'U' or 'D', `u` is assigned -1, `r` is 0, if the first character of string `s` is 'R', `r` is assigned 1, if the first character of string `s` is 'L', `r` is assigned -1, `pref_sums[0]` is updated to `[r, u]`, `new_x` is assigned `x1 + r`, `new_y` is assigned `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as the absolute difference between `new_x - x2` and `new_y - y2`, then subtracting 1 from it, if `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `u` is assigned 1, `r` is assigned 0**
