Output State: 
If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, then the program will print `res` and return. Otherwise, the loop will iterate through the range of `n` and calculate the values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. The `dist` will be calculated as described, and if it is less than or equal to 0, the program will print the result of 'res + i + 1'. If `dist` is always greater than 0 for all iterations of the loop, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, there will be no change in the state of the variables.
