You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 are non-negative integers such that (x_1, y_1) != (x_2, y_2). n is a positive integer. s is a string of length n consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R.**
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`x1`, `y1`, `n` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only letters U, D, L, and R. If `(x1, y1) != (x2, y2)`, then the program executes the if part, and it returns nothing. In case `(x1, y1) == (x2, y2)`, the program prints 0 and returns.

Case_2: *`x1`, `y1`, `n` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only U, D, L, and R. If `(x1, y1) != (x2, y2)`, the program executes the if part and `r` is assigned the value -1. In case `(x1, y1) == (x2, y2)`, the program prints 0 and returns. `n` is an input integer. `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size `n` with all elements initialized to [0, 0]. If the first character of string `s` is 'U' or 'D', then `u` is assigned the value -1 and `r` is 0. If the first character of string `s` is 'R', then `r` is assigned the value 1. After the execution of the if part, where `s[0] == 'L'`, the program state remains the same as the precondition with the additional change of `r` being assigned the value -1, and `pref_sums[0]` is updated to `[r, u]`. `new_x` is assigned the value `x1 + r`, and `new_y` is assigned the value `y1 + u`. `dist` is calculated as the absolute difference between `new_x - x2` and `new_y - y2`, then subtracting 1 from it. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1.

Case_3: Output State: 
- All variables retain their respective values after each iteration of the loop. 
- If `dist` is less than or equal to 0 at any point during the loop execution, the program prints the value of `i + 1` and returns. 
- If the first character of string `s` is 'U' or 'D', `u` is assigned the value -1 and `r` is 0. 
- If the first character of string `s` is 'R', `r` is assigned the value 1. 
- After the execution of the if part where `s[0] == 'L'`, the program state remains the same as the precondition, with the additional change of `r` being assigned the value -1 and `pref_sums[0]` updated to `[r, u]`. 
- `new_x` is assigned the value `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, and `new_y` is assigned the value `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`.

Case_4: *moves_toward is an integer. If moves_toward is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and returns. No changes occur if moves_toward is greater than 0.

Case_5: *`moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, and `y1` are integers. If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, then the program prints `res` and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.

Case_6: Output State: 
If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, then the program will print `res` and return. Otherwise, the loop will iterate through the range of `n` and calculate the values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. The `dist` will be calculated as described, and if it is less than or equal to 0, the program will print the result of 'res + i + 1'. If `dist` is always greater than 0 for all iterations of the loop, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, there will be no change in the state of the variables.

Case_7: The program returns either the result of 'res + i + 1' or there is no change in the state of the variables

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
