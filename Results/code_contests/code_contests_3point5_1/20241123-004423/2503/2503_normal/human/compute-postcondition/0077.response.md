Output State: **`moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `n`, `i` are integers. The condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles` is satisfied. `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on the calculation. `dist` is calculated as described. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the result of 'res + i + 1'. `i` is incremented by 1**
