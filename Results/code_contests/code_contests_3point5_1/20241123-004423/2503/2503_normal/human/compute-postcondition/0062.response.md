Example Answer: 
The value of `cycles` is calculated based on the formula provided. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1 and returns without affecting any variables. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the value of `cycles` is computed using the formula. Therefore, the Output State is: `moves_toward` is an integer and either prints -1 and returns or remains unchanged if greater than 0; `cycles` is calculated based on the formula if `moves_toward` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`moves_toward` is an integer and either prints -1 and returns or remains unchanged if greater than 0; `cycles` is calculated based on the formula if `moves_toward` is greater than 0**
