According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `n`, `i` are integers, `x2`, `y2` satisfy the condition, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on the calculation `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, `dist` is calculated, and `dist` is greater than 0. Since `i` is the loop variable and it increments by 1 in each iteration, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is one more than the previous value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `n`, `i+1`, `x2`, `y2`, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist` are in the updated state**
