Postcondition: ***`moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, and `y1` are integers. If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, then the program prints `res` and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
