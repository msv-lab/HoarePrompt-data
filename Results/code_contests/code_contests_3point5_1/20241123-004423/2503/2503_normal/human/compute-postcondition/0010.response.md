Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `n` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only letters U, D, L, and R. If `(x1, y1) != (x2, y2)`, then the program executes the if part, and it returns nothing. In case `(x1, y1) == (x2, y2)`, the program prints 0 and returns. `n` is an input integer. `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size `n` with all elements initialized to [0, 0]. `u` is assigned the value 0, and `r` is 0. The first character of string `s` is 'U'***
