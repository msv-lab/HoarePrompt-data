According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`u` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 2**
