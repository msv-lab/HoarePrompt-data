According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, and `cycles` needs to be evaluated to determine if the loop will execute. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the condition is met.
State: **`moves_toward`, `cycles`, `res`, `x1`, `y1`, `n` are integers, condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles` is satisfied**
