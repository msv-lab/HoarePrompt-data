Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program implements the given problem description correctly. It takes input for the number of test cases, the length of the sequence, and its maximum value. It then calculates the lexicographically maximum sequence 'b' without exceeding the total number of inversions in 'a' for each test case. The logic for generating the permutation 'p' is based on the problem requirements and constraints. The program iterates through all possible values to find the permutation that satisfies the conditions. Overall, the code seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
