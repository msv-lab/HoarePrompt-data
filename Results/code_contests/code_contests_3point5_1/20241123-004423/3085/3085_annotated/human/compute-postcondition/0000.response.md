Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`. Since the function is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`, but we know that they are integers satisfying the given precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `k` are integers satisfying the precondition.**
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers satisfying the precondition.**
