The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. However, it has preconditions that `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. After executing the function body, the function has three possible cases:

Case 1: If `n` equals `k`, the program returns a range starting from 1 up to and including the value of `k`.

Case 2: If `n` equals `k`, the program returns a range starting from 1 up to and including the value of `k`. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the program returns a range from 1 up to `k - 1` concatenated with `k` and `k - 1`.

Case 3: If `2 * k - n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, a range from 1 to `k` is returned where the `k`-th element is assigned the value of the last `i` and the `i`-th element is assigned the value of `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to handle the above cases based on the preconditions and return different ranges or no change in the state of program variables accordingly.
