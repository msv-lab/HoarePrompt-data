Example Answer:
The value of `i` is assigned to `a[k - 1]`, where `i` ranges from `2 * k - n` to `k`. Since `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, the loop runs correctly. Therefore, `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`. 
Output State: **`n` and `k` satisfy the condition: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` starts from `2 * k - n` and ends at `k`; `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`**
