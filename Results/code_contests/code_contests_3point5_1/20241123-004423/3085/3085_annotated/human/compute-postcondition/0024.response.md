According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `k + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`, `curInv` is the return value of function func_8 with parameter `a` and `n`, `i` is less than `k`**.
