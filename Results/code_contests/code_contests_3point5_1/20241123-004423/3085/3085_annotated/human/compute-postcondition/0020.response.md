According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` satisfy the condition: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` starts from `2 * k - n` and ends at `k`; `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`; `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`; `curInv` is the return value of function func_8 with parameter `a` and `n`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k`, where the `k`-th element is assigned the value of `i` and the `i`-th element is assigned the value of `k`. Otherwise, no operation is performed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following state needs to be adjusted:
State: **`n` and `k` satisfy the condition: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` starts from `2 * k - n` and ends at `k`; `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`; `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`; `curInv` is the return value of function func_8 with parameter `a` and `n`, `i` is less than `k`**
