Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` satisfy the condition: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` starts from `2 * k - n` and ends at `k`; `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`; `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`; `curInv` is the return value of function func_8 with parameter `a` and `n`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k`, where the `k`-th element is assigned the value of `i` and the `i`-th element is assigned the value of `k`. Otherwise, no operation is performed.***
