Example Answer:
`a[k - 2]` is assigned the value `k`, which satisfies the given condition in the initial state. The value of `k` is unchanged, so the output state is: `n` and `k` satisfy the condition: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` starts from `2 * k - n` and ends at `k`; `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` satisfy the condition: `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` starts from `2 * k - n` and ends at `k`; `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`**
