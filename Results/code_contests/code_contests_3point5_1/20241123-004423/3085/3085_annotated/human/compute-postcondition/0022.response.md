According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`, `curInv` is the return value of function func_8 with parameter `a` and `n`, `i` is less than `k`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be less than `k + 1`.
State: **`a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`, `curInv` is the return value of function func_8 with parameter `a` and `n`, `i` is less than `k + 1`**
