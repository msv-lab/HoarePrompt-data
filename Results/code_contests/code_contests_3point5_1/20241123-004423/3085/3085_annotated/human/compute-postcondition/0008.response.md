Example Answer: 
The function `func_8` is called with arguments `a` and `n`, and the returned value is stored in `maxInv`. Based on the conditions provided, the state of the variables `n` and `k` will determine the output state. If `n` equals `k`, the returned value will be a range from 1 up to and including `k`. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the returned value will be a range from 1 up to `k - 1` concatenated with `k` and `k - 1`. If neither condition is met, there will be no change in the state of the program variables.
Output State: **Depends on the values of `n` and `k` and the conditions met during the function execution**
