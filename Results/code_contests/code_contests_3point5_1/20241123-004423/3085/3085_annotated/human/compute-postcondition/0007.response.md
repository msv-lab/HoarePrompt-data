Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers. If `n` equals `k`, the program returns a range starting from 1 up to and including the value of `k`. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the program returns a range from 1 up to `k - 1` concatenated with `k` and `k - 1`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.**
