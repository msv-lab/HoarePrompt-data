Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines functions to handle input, calculate inversions, and generate the required permutation.
2. The permutation is generated based on the given conditions and constraints.
3. The program iterates through possible permutations to find the one that maximizes lexicographical order without exceeding the total number of inversions.
4. The logic and conditions in the program seem to align with the problem description.
5. Without finding a specific case where the program fails to meet the requirements, we can assume that the program is correct based on the provided annotations and code logic.
