You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a sequence a with n elements 1, 2, 3, ..., k - 1, k, k - 1, k - 2, ..., k - (n - k) (k ≤ n < 2k).

Let's call as inversion in a a pair of indices i < j such that a[i] > a[j].

Suppose, you have some permutation p of size k and you build a sequence b of size n in the following manner: b[i] = p[a[i]].

Your goal is to find such permutation p that the total number of inversions in b doesn't exceed the total number of inversions in a, and b is lexicographically maximum.

Small reminder: the sequence of k integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to k exactly once.

Another small reminder: a sequence s is lexicographically smaller than another sequence t, if either s is a prefix of t, or for the first i such that s_i ≠ t_i, s_i < t_i holds (in the first position that these sequences are different, s has smaller number than t).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (k ≤ n < 2k; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the length of the sequence a and its maximum.

It's guaranteed that the total sum of k over test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print k integers — the permutation p which maximizes b lexicographically without increasing the total number of inversions.

It can be proven that p exists and is unique.

Example

Input


4
1 1
2 2
3 2
4 3


Output


1 
1 2 
2 1 
1 3 2 

Note

In the first test case, the sequence a = [1], there is only one permutation p = [1].

In the second test case, the sequence a = [1, 2]. There is no inversion in a, so there is only one permutation p = [1, 2] which doesn't increase the number of inversions.

In the third test case, a = [1, 2, 1] and has 1 inversion. If we use p = [2, 1], then b = [p[a[1]], p[a[2]], p[a[3]]] = [2, 1, 2] and also has 1 inversion.

In the fourth test case, a = [1, 2, 3, 2], and since p = [1, 3, 2] then b = [1, 3, 2, 3]. Both a and b have 1 inversion and b is the lexicographically maximum.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
