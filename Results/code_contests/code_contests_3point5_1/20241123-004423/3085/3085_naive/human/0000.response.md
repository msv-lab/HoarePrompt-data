Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems that the program is correctly implemented to find the permutation p that maximizes b lexicographically without exceeding the total number of inversions in a. The code considers different cases based on the values of n and k, and calculates the inversion count for each permutation to find the optimal permutation.

The code handles the given constraints and requirements of the problem description. Additionally, the logic and calculations in the code seem to align with the problem statement provided. Since no specific case or scenario was found where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is considered as True.
