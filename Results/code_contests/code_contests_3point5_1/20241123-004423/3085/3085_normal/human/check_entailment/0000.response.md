Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_9` does not return the lexicographically maximum permutation `p` that satisfies the conditions given in the problem description for all test cases. The code may fail to produce the correct output for certain scenarios where the total number of inversions in permutation `p` exceeds the total number of inversions in sequence `a`.

Although the function attempts to handle different cases based on the values of `n` and `k`, there is a possibility that the permutation generated may not meet the requirements of being lexicographically maximum while not increasing the total number of inversions. This discrepancy indicates that the code does not align with the problem description for all potential cases.

Therefore, the code does not meet the specified requirements and is deemed incorrect.
