Output State: 

If `n` is equal to `k`, the loop does not execute. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the loop executes once where `n` and `k` are valid integers, `maxInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `curInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, and the function returns a list `ans` with values from 1 to `k`, where the elements at indices `k - 1` and `i - 1` are swapped, and the element at index `k` is assigned the value `k - 1`.

Output State: **If n is equal to k, the loop does not execute. If n is equal to k + 1, the loop executes once and returns a modified list ans as described.**
