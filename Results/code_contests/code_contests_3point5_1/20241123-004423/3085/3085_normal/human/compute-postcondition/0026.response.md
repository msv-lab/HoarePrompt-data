The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. 

In Case_1, if `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, there is no change in the state of the program.

In Case_2, if `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, there is no change in the state of the program. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k - 1` (inclusive) concatenated with the values `k` and `k - 1`.

In Case_3, if `n` is equal to `k`, the loop does not execute. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the loop executes once and returns a modified list `ans` as described.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to handle different cases based on the values of `n` and `k` within the specified constraints, returning different ranges and modified lists accordingly.
