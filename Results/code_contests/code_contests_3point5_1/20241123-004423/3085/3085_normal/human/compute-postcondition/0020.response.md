According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `i < k` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are valid integers where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`. Additionally, `maxInv` and `curInv` are values returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, and `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated such that `i < k`. Since the loop iterates over the range from `2 * k - n` to `k`, the next value of `i` should be `k` in order for the loop to execute again.
State: **`n` and `k` are valid integers where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`, `maxInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, and `curInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `i` is `k`**
