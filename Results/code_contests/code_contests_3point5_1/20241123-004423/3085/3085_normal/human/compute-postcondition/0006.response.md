Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are valid integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, there is no change in the state of the program. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k - 1` (inclusive) concatenated with the values `k` and `k - 1`.***
