According to the code, the loop can execute if `xrange(2 * k - n, k)` is a valid range. This means that `2 * k - n` must be less than `k` for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `maxInv` is assigned a value returned by the function `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to: `n` and `k` are valid integers, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, `maxInv` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, and `2 * k - n` is less than `k`. 
State: **`n` and `k` are valid integers, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, `maxInv` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`**
