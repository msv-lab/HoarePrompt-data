According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are valid integers where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`, `maxInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, and `curInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `i` is `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 1`.
State: **`n` and `k` are valid integers where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`, `maxInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, and `curInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `i` is `k - 1`**
