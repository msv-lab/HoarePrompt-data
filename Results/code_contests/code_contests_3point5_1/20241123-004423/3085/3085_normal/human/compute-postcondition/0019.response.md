Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are valid integers where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`. `maxInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, and `curInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`. Additionally, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is `k`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function returns a list `ans` with values from 1 to `k`, where the elements at indices `k - 1` and `i - 1` are swapped, and the element at index `k` is assigned the value `k`.***
