Output State: **`n` and `k` are valid integers where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`, `maxInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, and `curInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `i` is `k`**
