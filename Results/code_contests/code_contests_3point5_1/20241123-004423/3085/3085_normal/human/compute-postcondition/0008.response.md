Output State: **`n` and `k` are valid integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the program returns a range from 1 to `k - 1` concatenated with the values `k` and `k - 1`; `maxInv` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`.**
