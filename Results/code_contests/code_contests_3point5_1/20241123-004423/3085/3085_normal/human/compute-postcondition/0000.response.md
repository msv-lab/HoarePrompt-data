Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `func_2()`. Since `n` and `k` are integers satisfying the given constraints, the values returned by `func_2()` would be valid integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `k` are valid integers within the given constraints**.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are valid integers within the given constraints**
