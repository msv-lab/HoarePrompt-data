According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `2 * k - n` is less than `k` holds true. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `n` and `k` are valid integers where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`, `maxInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `curInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `i`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `i` is `k - 1`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the value of `i` to `k` and ensure that the condition `2 * k - n` is less than `k` still holds true.
State: **`n` and `k` are valid integers where `n` is not equal to `k` or `k + 1`, `maxInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `curInv` is the value returned by `func_8` with arguments `a` and `n`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `a[k - 1]` is `k`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `i` is `k`**
