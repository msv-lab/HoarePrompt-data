The function `func_7` accepts parameters `BITree`, `n`, `index`, and `val`. It updates the values in the `BITree` list based on the given `index` and `val` while incrementing the `index` using a specific formula. The function iterates through the loop as long as the `index` is less than or equal to `n`. If the initial `index` is greater than `n`, the loop will not execute.
