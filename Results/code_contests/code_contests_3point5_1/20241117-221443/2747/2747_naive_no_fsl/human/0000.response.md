Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It seems to have multiple issues such as:
1. The logic for generating subsequences and checking if they are non-decreasing is incorrect.
2. The calculation and handling of modulo 10^9 + 7 is not correct.
3. The program does not handle the input format specified in the problem description.
4. The program is not efficient and may not work for larger input sizes.

Overall, the program is not correct and needs to be re-implemented following the problem description accurately.
