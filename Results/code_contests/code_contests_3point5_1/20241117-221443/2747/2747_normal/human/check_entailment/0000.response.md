Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not seem to follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the function should calculate the number of subsequences of b that are non-decreasing and have elements with remainder of dividing a by n. However, the code provided does not seem to implement this logic correctly. The code reads the input, creates unique pairs of elements, and calculates the sum of the unique pairs and the length of the original list `order`. The final result is the sum modulo 10^9 + 7, which does not align with the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not adhere to the requirements specified in the problem description.
