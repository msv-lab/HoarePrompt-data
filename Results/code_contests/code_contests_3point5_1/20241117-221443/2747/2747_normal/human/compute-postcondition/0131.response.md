Output State: **If count is equal to or greater than len(order), the loop won't execute. If len(order) is less than 1 or inp[1] is less than 1, the loop won't execute. If temp[0] or lol is in same, temp and lol are cleared, and count is incremented by 1. If len(same) is equal to int(inp[1]), the loop breaks. Otherwise, same appends temp[0], temp and lol are cleared, and count is incremented by 1 until count reaches len(order) - 1.**
