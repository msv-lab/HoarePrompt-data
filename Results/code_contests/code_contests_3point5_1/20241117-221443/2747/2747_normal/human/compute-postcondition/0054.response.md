Output State: **`order` contains the element from list `a` based on the final value of `c`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the previous value of `c`, `i` is 1, `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0, `count` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `order` appends the element at index `c` from list `a`. If `c` reaches the end of the list `a`, it wraps around to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `count` is incremented by 1.**
