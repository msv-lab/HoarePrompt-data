Output State: **If count is at least 1 and len(order) is at least 2, temp is a list containing elements from order, lol is a list containing elements from temp, same is a list. If temp[0] or lol is in same, temp and lol are reset to empty lists, count is increased by 1. If len(same) is equal to int(inp[1]), the program breaks. Otherwise, temp[0] is appended to same, temp and lol are reset to empty lists, count is increased by 1.**
