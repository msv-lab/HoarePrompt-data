Example Answer: 
The code appends the second element of the first element of the list `temp` to the list `lol`. Since the element of `temp` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value that is being appended. Therefore, the output state is: count is 0, temp is a list with an unknown element, lol has a new element appended to it.
Output State: **count is 0, temp is a list with an unknown element, lol has a new element appended to it**
