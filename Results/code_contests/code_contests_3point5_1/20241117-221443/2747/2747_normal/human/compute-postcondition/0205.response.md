Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer with a value of 1. `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list. If the first element of `temp` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are cleared, `count` is incremented by 1, and the program continues execution. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the program terminates the most internal loop or if statement with a break statement, otherwise the first element of `temp` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
