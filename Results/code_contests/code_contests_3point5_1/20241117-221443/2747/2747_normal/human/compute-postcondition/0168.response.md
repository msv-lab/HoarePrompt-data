According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `count` and `order`. If `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions were checked based on the values in the variables. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value at index 1 of `inp`, the loop breaks. If neither condition is met, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `count` is incremented by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following steps need to be taken:
1. Check if `count` is less than `len(order) - 1`.
2. Apply the conditions based on the values of `temp[0]`, `same`, `lol`, and `inp` as described.
3. Modify the states accordingly to satisfy the conditions for the next iteration.

State: **count is an integer, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, same is a list, and the necessary adjustments based on the conditions described above.**
