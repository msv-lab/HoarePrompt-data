Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, the variables `order`, `same`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `count`, `temp`, and `lol` are in specific states. The condition for the if part is checked where `same` has the same length as `int(inp[1])`. If this condition is met, the loop breaks. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. If neither `temp[0]` nor `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are cleared, `same` appends `temp[0]`, and `count` is incremented by 1. Ensure that these conditions cover all edge cases and the overall state of the program variables is correctly reflected.***
