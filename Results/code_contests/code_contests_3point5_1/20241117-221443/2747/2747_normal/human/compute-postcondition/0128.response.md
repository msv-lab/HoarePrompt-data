Output State: **same is a list that includes temp[0] or lol, a is a list of strings created by splitting the input, c is between 0 and len(a) - 1 based on loop executions, i is int(inp[1]) - 1, count is either incremented by 1 or 2, temp contains [], lol is empty, count is less than or equal to the length of order - 2, lol appends temp[0][0]. If the length of same is equal to int(inp[1]), the loop breaks, count is incremented by 1**
