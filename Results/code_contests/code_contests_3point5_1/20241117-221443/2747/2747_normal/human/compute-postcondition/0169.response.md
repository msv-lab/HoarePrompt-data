Example Answer:
The `temp` list appends a sublist containing `order[i]` and `order[count]`. The values of `order[i]` and `order[count]` are determined by their previous values. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol is an empty list, same is a list.
Output State: **count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol is an empty list, same is a list**
