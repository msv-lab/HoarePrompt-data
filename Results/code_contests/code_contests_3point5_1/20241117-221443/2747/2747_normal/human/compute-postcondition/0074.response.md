Postcondition: ***`order` contains the elements from list `a` based on the final value of `c`. `same` is an empty list. `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input. `c` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the previous value of `c`. `i` is 1. `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0. `count` is equal to 5. `order` appends the element at the index `c` from list `a`. If `c` is at the last index of `a`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is incremented by 1.***
