Postcondition: ***`order` contains the first element of list `a`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0, and `count` is increased by 2. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is increased by 1. Ensure to handle the edge cases where `c` can be 0 or 1 after the if-else block.***
