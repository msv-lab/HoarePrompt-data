Output State: **order has at least 1 element, same is a list that includes temp[0] or lol, a is a list of strings created by splitting the input, c is between 0 and len(a) - 1 based on loop executions, i is int(inp[1]) - 1, count is either incremented by 1 or 2, temp contains [[order[i], order[count]]], lol contains the value of temp[0][1], count is less than or equal to the length of order - 2, lol appends temp[0][0]. If the length of same is equal to int(inp[1]), the loop breaks. The overall state of the program variables remains consistent with the initial precondition, ensuring the specified conditions are met, including the boundary values and edge cases. `same` appends the value of `temp[0]`.**
