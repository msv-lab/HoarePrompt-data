Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `count` is unknown. The lists `temp` and `lol` remain empty, and the variable 'same' still has no value. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer (unknown value), `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and 'same' has no value.
Output State: **count is an integer (unknown value), `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and 'same' has no value**
