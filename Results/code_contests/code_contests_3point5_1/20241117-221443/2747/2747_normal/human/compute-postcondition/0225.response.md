Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, so the previous values of `count`, `temp`, and `lol` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer with a value of 4, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains the 2nd element of `order` and the first element of `temp`.
Output State: **`count` is an integer with a value of 4, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains the 2nd element of `order` and the first element of `temp`**
