Postcondition: ***count is an integer, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list, same is a list. If temp[0] is in same or lol is in same, then count is incremented by 1, temp and lol are reset to empty lists. Otherwise, if the length of same is equal to the integer value at index 1 of inp, the loop breaks. If neither condition is met, temp[0] is appended to same, and count is incremented by 1.***
