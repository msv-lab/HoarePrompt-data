Postcondition: ***count is an integer, temp is a list containing the appended list, lol is a list with the value at index 1 of the element at index 0 of temp, lol has the value appended from temp[0][0]. If the length of 'same' is equal to the integer value at inp[1], then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
