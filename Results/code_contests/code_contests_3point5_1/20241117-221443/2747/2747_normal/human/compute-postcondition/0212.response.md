Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1, where `count` had a previous value of 2, so after execution, `count` is 3. The values of `temp` and `lol` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
