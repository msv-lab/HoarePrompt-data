Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp`, `lol` are set to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the program terminates. If neither condition is met, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `same` has `temp[0]` appended to it, and `count` is increased by 1.***
