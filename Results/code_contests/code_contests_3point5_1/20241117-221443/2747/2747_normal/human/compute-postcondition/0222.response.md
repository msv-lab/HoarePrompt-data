Example Answer: 
`temp` is a list where a new list `[order[i], order[count]]` is appended. The value of `count` is 4, so it will be the index used in `order`. The output state is: `count` is an integer with a value of 4, `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[4]]`, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`count` is an integer with a value of 4, `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[4]]`, `lol` is an empty list**
