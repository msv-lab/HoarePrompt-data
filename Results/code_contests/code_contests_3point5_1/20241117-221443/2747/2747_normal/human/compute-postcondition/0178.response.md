Example Answer: 
The element at index 0 of temp is appended to the list same. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list.
Output State: **count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list**
