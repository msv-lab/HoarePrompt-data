Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the new value of `count` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 2.
Output State: **`same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 2**
