Postcondition: ***count is an integer, temp is a list, lol is a list, same is a list. If temp[0] or lol is in same, temp and lol are reset to empty lists, count is increased by 1. Otherwise, if len(same) is equal to int(inp[1]), the program breaks. If not, temp[0] is appended to same, temp and lol are reset to empty lists, count is increased by 1.***
