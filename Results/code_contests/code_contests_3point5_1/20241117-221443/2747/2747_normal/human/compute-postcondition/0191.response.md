Example Answer: 
A new element is appended to the list `lol` from the first element of the list `temp`. The value of `temp` is unknown, but `lol` now has an additional element. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `temp` is a list with an unknown element, `lol` has a new element appended to it.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is a list with an unknown element, `lol` has a new element appended to it**
