Postcondition: ***`order` contains the first element of list `a`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0, `count` is increased by 1. If `c` equals len(a) - 1, `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `count` is incremented by 1.***
