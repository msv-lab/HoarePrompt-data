Example Answer:
`lol` appends the value `temp[0][0]` which is the first element of the first sublist in `temp`. Since `temp` contains a new list with values `order[i]` and `order[2]`, and `lol` contains the value `order[i]`, after appending `temp[0][0]`, `lol` now contains both values `order[i]` and the first element of the first sublist in `temp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer with a value of 2, `temp` is a list containing a new list with values `order[i]` and `order[2]`, `lol` contains the value `order[i]` and the first element of the first sublist in `temp`.
Output State: **`count` is an integer with a value of 2, `temp` is a list containing a new list with values `order[i]` and `order[2]`, `lol` contains the value `order[i]` and the first element of the first sublist in `temp`**
