Example Answer: 
The code appends the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp to the list lol. The previous values of the variables are as follows: count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol is an empty list, and same is a list. After execution, the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp is added to lol. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list.
Output State: **count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list**
