Output State: **`order` contains the first element of list `a`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 0, `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0, `count` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed. If `c` equals `len(a) - 1`, `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `count` is incremented. If `count` exceeds `int(inp[0])`, the loop will terminate.**
