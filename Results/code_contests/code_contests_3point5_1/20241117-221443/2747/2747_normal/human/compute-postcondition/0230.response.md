Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer with a value of 4, `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[4], order[i]]`, `lol` contains the 2nd element of `order` and the first element of `temp`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables `count`, `temp`, and `lol`.***
