Output State: **`order` contains the next element of list `a`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the previous value of `c`, `i` is 0, `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0, `count` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed + 2, and `order` appends the element at index `c` from list `a`. If c is equal to len(a) - 1, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is increased by 1. If c is not equal to len(a) - 1, then `c` is incremented by 1.**
