Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` is not defined.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` is not defined**
