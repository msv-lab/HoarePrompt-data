Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `count` is not specified, so after execution, `count` is count + 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol is an empty list, same is a list.
Output State: **count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol is an empty list, same is a list**
