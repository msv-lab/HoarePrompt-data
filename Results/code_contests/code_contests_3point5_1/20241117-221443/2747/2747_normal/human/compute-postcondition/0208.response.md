The value at index 0 of the nested list inside `temp` is appended to the list `lol`. The value at index 0 of the nested list inside `temp` is `order[i]`, so the value appended to `lol` is `order[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer with a value of 2, `temp` is a list containing a new list with values `order[i]` and `order[2]`, `lol` contains the value `order[i]`.
Output State: **`count` is an integer with a value of 2, `temp` is a list containing a new list with values `order[i]` and `order[2]`, `lol` contains the value `order[i]`**
