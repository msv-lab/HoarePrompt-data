Postcondition: ***`order` has at least 1 element, `same` is a list that includes temp[0] or lol, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is between 0 and len(a) - 1 based on loop executions, `i` is int(inp[1]) - 1, `count` is either incremented by 1 or 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list. If temp[0] or lol is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` is equal to int(inp[1]), the loop breaks. If neither temp[0] nor lol is in `same`, `same` appends `temp[0]`, and `count` is either incremented by 1 or 2 based on the condition.***
