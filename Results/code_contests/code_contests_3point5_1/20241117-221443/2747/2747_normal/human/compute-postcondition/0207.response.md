Example Answer:
The `temp` list appends a new list containing the values of `order[i]` and `order[count]`. Since the value of `count` is 2, the new list will contain the values of `order[i]` and `order[2]`. The output state is: `count` is an integer with a value of 2, `temp` is a list containing a new list with values `order[i]` and `order[2]`, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`count` is an integer with a value of 2, `temp` is a list containing a new list with values `order[i]` and `order[2]`, `lol` is an empty list**
