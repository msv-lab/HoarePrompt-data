Output State: **If int(inp[1]) is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `order` will contain elements from list `a` based on the final value of `c`, `same` will remain an empty list, `a` will still be a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` will be a value between 0 and len(a) - 1 depending on the number of loop executions, `i` will be equal to int(inp[1]) - 1, `count` will be equal to int(inp[0]) if it is not exceeded. If count exceeds int(inp[0]), the loop will not execute and `order` will not be updated.**
