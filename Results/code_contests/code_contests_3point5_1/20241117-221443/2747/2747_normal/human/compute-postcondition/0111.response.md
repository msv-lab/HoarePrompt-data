Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous values of `same` appending `temp[0]`, `temp` being cleared, `lol` being cleared, and `count` being incremented by 1 are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is cleared, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is cleared, `count` is incremented by 1**
