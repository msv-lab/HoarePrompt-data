Postcondition: ***count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list. If the length of same is equal to the integer value at index 1 of inp, then the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. This covers the case when the condition is met and the loop is exited.***
