Output State: **`order` has at least 1 element, `same` is a list that includes temp[0] or lol, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is between 0 and len(a) - 1 based on loop executions, `i` is int(inp[1]) - 1, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same, `temp` contains the appended value [order[i], order[count]], `lol` is cleared if temp has elements, `lol` contains the element temp[0][1] if temp has elements, `lol` appends temp[0][0] if temp has elements. If temp[0] or lol is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` is equal to int(inp[1]), the loop breaks. If neither temp[0] nor lol is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, `same` appends temp[0], and `count` is incremented by 1**
