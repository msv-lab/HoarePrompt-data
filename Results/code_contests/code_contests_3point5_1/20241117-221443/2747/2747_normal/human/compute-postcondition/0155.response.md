Example Answer:
The value at index 0, index 1 of the list `temp` is appended to the list `lol`. If `temp` is a nested list and contains elements at index 0 and index 1, then the value at index 1 of the element at index 0 is appended to `lol`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, temp is a list containing the appended list, lol is a list with the value at index 1 of the element at index 0 of temp.
Output State: **count is an integer, temp is a list containing the appended list, lol is a list with the value at index 1 of the element at index 0 of temp**
