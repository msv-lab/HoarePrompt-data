Output State: **If int(inp[1]) is greater than 0, after the loop executes: `order` will contain elements from list `a` based on the final value of `c`, `same` will be a list containing unique pairs of elements from `order`, `a` will still be a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` will be a value between 0 and len(a) - 1 depending on the number of loop executions, `i` will be equal to int(inp[1]) - 1, `count` will be equal to int(inp[0]) if it is not exceeded. If count exceeds int(inp[0]), the loop will not execute and `order` will not be updated. If len(order) is less than 1 or inp[1] is less than 1, the loop won't execute. If temp[0] or lol is in same, temp and lol are cleared, and count is incremented by 1. If len(same) is equal to int(inp[1]), the loop breaks. Otherwise, same appends temp[0], temp and lol are cleared, and count is incremented by 1 until count reaches len(order) - 1. The program then prints the sum of the lengths of `same` and `order` modulo (10^9 + 7).**
