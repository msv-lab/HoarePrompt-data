Example Answer: 
`count` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: If count is less than len(order) - 1, len(order) is at least 2, inp[1] is at least 2, temp[0] and lol are not in same, len(same) is less than int(inp[1]); `count` is 0.
Output State: **If count is less than len(order) - 1, len(order) is at least 2, inp[1] is at least 2, temp[0] and lol are not in same, len(same) is less than int(inp[1]); `count` is 0**
