Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer with a value of 2, `temp` is a list containing a new list with values `order[i]` and `order[2]`, `lol` contains the value `order[i]` and the first element of the first sublist in `temp`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `count`, `temp`, and `lol`.***
