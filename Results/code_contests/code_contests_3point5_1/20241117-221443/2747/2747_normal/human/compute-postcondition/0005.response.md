According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(inp[1])`. If `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `order` is an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, and `c` is 0 do not ensure the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0, `order` is an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, and `c` is 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`order` is an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, `int(inp[1])` is greater than 0**
