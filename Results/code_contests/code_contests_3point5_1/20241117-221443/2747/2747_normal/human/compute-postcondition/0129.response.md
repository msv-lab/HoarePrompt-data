Postcondition: ***`order` has at least 1 element, `same` is a list that includes `temp[0]` or `lol`, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is between 0 and `len(a) - 1` based on loop executions, `i` is `int(inp[1]) - 1`, `count` is either incremented by 1 or 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `count` is less than or equal to the length of `order` - 2. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` become empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Then, `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` and `lol` become empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
