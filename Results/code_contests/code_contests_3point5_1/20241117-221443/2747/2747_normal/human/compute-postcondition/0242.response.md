Functionality: ** The `func` function reads input, processes it to create unique pairs of elements, and calculates the sum of the unique pairs and the length of the original list `order`. The function then prints the sum modulo 10^9 + 7. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **

Note: The annotations provide insights into the expected state of variables at different stages of execution, but the actual code may not align with these annotations. It's important to focus on what the code does rather than solely relying on the annotations.
