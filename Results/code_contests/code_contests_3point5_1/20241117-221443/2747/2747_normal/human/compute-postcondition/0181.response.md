Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The lists `temp`, `lol`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by 1, `temp` contains an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` is a list with no changes.
Output State: **`count` is increased by 1, `temp` contains an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` is a list with no changes**
