According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count` and the length of `order`. If `count` is less than or equal to the length of `order` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `count` needs to be adjusted to 2, as it should be less than or equal to the length of `order` - 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`count` is an integer with a value of 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
