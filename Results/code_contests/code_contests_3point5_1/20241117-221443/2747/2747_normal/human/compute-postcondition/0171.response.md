Example Answer:
The `lol` list appends the first element of the first sublist in `temp`, which is `temp[0][0]`. The value of `temp` is a sublist, the value of `lol` is the element at index 1 of the first sublist in `temp`, and the `same` list is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list.
Output State: **count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list**
