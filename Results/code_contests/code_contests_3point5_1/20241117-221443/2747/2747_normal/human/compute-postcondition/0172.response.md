Example Answer:
`temp` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list.
Output State: **count is an integer, temp contains the appended sublist, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list**
