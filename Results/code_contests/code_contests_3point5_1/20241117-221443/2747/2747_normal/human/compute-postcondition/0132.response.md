According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `count`, `len(order)`, `inp[1]`, `temp[0]`, `lol`, `same`, and `int(inp[1])`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:

1. `count` needs to be less than `len(order) - 1`.
2. `len(order)` needs to be at least 2.
3. `inp[1]` needs to be at least 2.
4. `temp[0]` and `lol` should not be in `same`.
5. `len(same)` should be less than `int(inp[1])`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **If count is less than len(order) - 1, len(order) is at least 2, inp[1] is at least 2, temp[0] and lol are not in same, len(same) is less than int(inp[1])**
