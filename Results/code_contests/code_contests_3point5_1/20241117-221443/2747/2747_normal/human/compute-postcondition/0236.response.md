According to the code, the loop can execute if the `count` is less than or equal to the length of the `order` list minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 5. To execute the loop one more time, `count` needs to be adjusted to 6. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **count is an integer with a value of 6, temp is an empty list, lol contains the 2nd element of order and the first element of temp. If temp[0] is in same or lol is in same, temp and lol are reset to empty lists, count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of same is equal to the integer value of inp[1], the program breaks. If none of the conditions are met, the 1st element of temp is appended to same.**
