Example Answer: 
The list `temp` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `count`, `lol`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: count is an integer, temp contains an empty list, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list.
Output State: **count is an integer, temp contains an empty list, lol contains the element at index 1 of the first sublist in temp, same is a list**
