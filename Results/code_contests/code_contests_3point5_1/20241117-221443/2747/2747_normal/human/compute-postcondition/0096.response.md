Output State: **`order` has at least 1 element, `same` has one more element appended, `a` is a list of strings created by splitting the input, `c` is between 0 and len(a) - 1 based on loop executions, `i` is int(inp[1]) - 1, `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains the element temp[0][1] if temp has elements, `lol` appends temp[0][0] if temp has elements, temp[0] is not in `same` and `lol` is not in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to int(inp[1]), then the program breaks out of the loop.**
