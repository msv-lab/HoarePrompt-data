Example Answer: 
`lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous values of other variables are `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is cleared, `count` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is incremented by 1**
