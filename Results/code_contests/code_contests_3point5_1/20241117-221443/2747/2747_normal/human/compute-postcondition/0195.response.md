Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is 0. After execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
