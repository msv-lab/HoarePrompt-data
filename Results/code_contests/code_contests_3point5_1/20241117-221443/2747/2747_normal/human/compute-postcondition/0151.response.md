Output State: **count is 1, temp contains a sublist with elements order[0] and order[0], lol is a list containing the second element of the sublist in temp, lol contains the first element of the sublist in temp, temp[0] is not in same and lol is not in same. If len(same) is equal to int(inp[1]), then the program breaks out of the loop maintaining the initial conditions specified in the precondition. `same` contains the first element of the sublist in temp, temp is an empty list. `lol` is an empty list.**
