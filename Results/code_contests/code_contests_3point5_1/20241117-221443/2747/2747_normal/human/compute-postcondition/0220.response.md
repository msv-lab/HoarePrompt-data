Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer with a value of 3, `temp` and `lol` are empty lists. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then all lists are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1, and the execution continues. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the execution stops. Else, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, all lists are emptied, and `count` is incremented by 1. The postcondition covers all possible cases of the program after the if-else block executes, including the edge cases.***
