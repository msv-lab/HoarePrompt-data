Output State: **If count is at most len(order) - 1, then after the loop execution:
- temp is an empty list
- lol is an empty list
- If the first element of temp is in the list same or lol is in the list same, then temp and lol are emptied, count is increased by 1
- If the length of same is equal to the integer value of inp[1], then the program breaks
- Otherwise, the first element of temp is appended to the list same, temp and lol are emptied, and count is increased by 1
- Once the loop finishes, count is equal to len(order) - 1 or greater than len(order) - 1 if the loop didn't break or have any other exit condition**
