According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `count` and `order`. If `count` is less than or equal to the length of `order` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 1. No adjustments need to be made to the `count` variable. 

For the `temp` and `lol` lists, if the first element of `temp` is in the list `same` or `lol` is in the list `same`, then `temp` and `lol` need to be emptied. If none of these conditions are met, the first element of `temp` needs to be appended to `same` and `temp` and `lol` need to be emptied. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **count is 1, temp is emptied list, lol is emptied list**
