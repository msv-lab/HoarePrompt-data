Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `count` is not provided, the new value of `count` will be 1 more than the previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 1**
