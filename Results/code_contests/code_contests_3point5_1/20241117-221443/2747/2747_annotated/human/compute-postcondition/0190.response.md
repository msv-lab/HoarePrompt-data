Example Answer:
The value at index 0 of `temp` is appended to the list `lol`. Assuming `temp` contains a list of lists and the first list has at least 2 elements, the value at index 1 of the first list in `temp` is appended to `lol`. The variables `count` and `temp` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `temp` contains one new element, `lol` contains the value at index 1 of the first list in `temp`.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one new element, `lol` contains the value at index 1 of the first list in `temp`**
