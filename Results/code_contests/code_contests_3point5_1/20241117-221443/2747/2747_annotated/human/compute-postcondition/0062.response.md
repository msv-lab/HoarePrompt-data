Postcondition: ***`order` contains elements added from list `a` at index `c`. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is assigned the value 0, `count` is increased by 1. If `c` is not equal to `len(a) - 1`, `c` is assigned the value of `c + 1`, `count` is increased by 1. `same` remains empty, `a` still contains input values, `i` is 1, `inp[1]` is greater than 0. This covers all possible cases and edge cases after the if-else block executes.***
