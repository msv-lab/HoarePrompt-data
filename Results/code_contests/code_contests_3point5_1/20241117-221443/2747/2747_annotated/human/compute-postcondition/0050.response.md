Postcondition: ***`order` contains elements added from list `a` starting at index `c`. If `c` is equal to len(a) - 1, `c` is set to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is incremented by 1. The variable `same` remains an empty list, `a` still contains the input values split by spaces, `i` remains 1, `inp[1]` is still greater than 0. In case `c` is at the end of list `a`, it wraps around to the beginning. `count` is consistently increased by 1 after each execution.***
