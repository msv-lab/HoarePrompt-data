Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of the first list in `temp` is appended to the list `lol`. The value at index 1 of the first list in `temp` is already stored in `lol`, so after execution, `lol` will contain the same value twice. The value of `count` remains 0 and the contents of `temp` do not change. 
Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one new element, `lol` contains the value at index 1 of the first list in `temp` twice**
