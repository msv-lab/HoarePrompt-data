Example Answer: 
`lol` is assigned an empty list. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains the appended value from `temp`.
Output State: **`count` is 2, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains the appended value from `temp`**
