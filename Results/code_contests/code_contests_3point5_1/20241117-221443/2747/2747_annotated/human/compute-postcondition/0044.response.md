Postcondition: ***`order` contains elements added from list `a` starting at index `c`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list containing the input values split by spaces, `c` is either 0 or between 0 and 1, `i` is 1, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 6. An element from list `a` at index `c` or `c+1` is appended to `order` based on the condition. If `c` is equal to the length of list `a` minus 1, `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is set to 4.***
