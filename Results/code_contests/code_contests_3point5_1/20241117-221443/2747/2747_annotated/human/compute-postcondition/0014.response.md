Postcondition: ***`order` contains elements added from list `a` starting at index `c`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list containing the input values split by spaces, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is increased by 1. If `c` is equal to the length of list `a` minus 1, `c` is reset to 0 and count is incremented. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and count is increased.***
