Output State: **`order` contains elements added from list `a` starting at index `c`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list containing the input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and 1, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is increased by 1 to 3. If `c` becomes the index of the last element in list `a`, it is reset to 0. If `count` is equal to `int(inp[0])`, the loop terminates.**
