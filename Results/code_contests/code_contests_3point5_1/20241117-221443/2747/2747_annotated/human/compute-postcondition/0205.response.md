Postcondition: ***count is 1, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list. If the first element of temp is in the list same or lol is in the list same, then temp and lol are emptied, count is increased by 1, and the program continues. If the length of same is equal to the integer value of inp[1], then the program breaks. If none of the above conditions are met, the first element of temp is appended to the list same, temp and lol are emptied, and count is increased by 1.***
