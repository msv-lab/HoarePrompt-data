Example Answer:
`count` is increased by 1, and since the initial value of `count` is 1, after execution, `count` becomes 2. The values of `temp` and `lol` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: count is 2, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list.
Output State: **count is 2, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list**
