Postcondition: ***`order` contains elements added from list `a` at index `0` if `c == len(a) - 1`, otherwise `order` contains elements added from list `a` at index `c + 1`. `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the previous condition. `count` has been increased by 2. `same` remains empty. `a` still contains input values. `i` is 1. `inp[1]` is greater than 0.***
