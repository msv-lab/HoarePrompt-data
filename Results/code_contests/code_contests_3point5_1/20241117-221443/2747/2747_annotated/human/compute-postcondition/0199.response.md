Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one new element, `lol` contains the value at index 1 of the first list in `temp` twice. The element at index 0 of `temp` is not in `same` and `lol` is not in `same`. The length of `same` is equal to the integer value in `inp[1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
