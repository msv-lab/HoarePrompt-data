Output State: **`order` is a list, `same` has an additional element appended from `temp[0]`, `a` contains input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `temp` contains the appended list with some values, `lol` contains the first element of the list in `temp[0][1] with the appended value of `temp[0][0]`. The condition (temp[0] in same or lol in same) is false, and the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1`. When the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1`, the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, the program continues without any changes to the variables.**
