Postcondition: ***`order` is a list, `same` is a list with elements, `a` contains input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the condition, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is less than or equal to the length of `order`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the pair `[order[i], order[count]]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are emptied, `count` is incremented by 1.***
