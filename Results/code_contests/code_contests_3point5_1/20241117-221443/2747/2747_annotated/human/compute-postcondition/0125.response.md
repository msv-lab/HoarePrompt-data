Output State: **`order`, `same` are lists, `a`, `temp`, `lol` are variables containing elements based on the conditions. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues iterating through the conditions with `count` incrementing by 1 and `lol` containing elements from `temp[0][0]` and `temp[0][1]`. The loop proceeds until `same` length equals `int(inp[1])` or `count` reaches the length of `order`, ensuring the conditions are met and edge cases handled properly. `same` appends `temp[0]` to it.**
