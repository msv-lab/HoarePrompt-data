Output State: **If `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `order` is a list, `same` contains elements based on the loop conditions, `a` contains input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `count` is either incremented or set to a value based on conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is either an empty list or contains elements based on loop operations. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, they are reset, `count` is increased by 1, loop continues. If length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, loop breaks. Otherwise, the pair `[order[i], order[count]]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset, `count` is incremented by 1.**
