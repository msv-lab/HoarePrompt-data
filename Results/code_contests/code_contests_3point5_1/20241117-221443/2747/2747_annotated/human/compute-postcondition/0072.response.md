Output State: **`order` contains elements added from list `a` at index `1` if `c == len(a) - 1`, otherwise `order` contains elements added from list `a` at index `c + 2`. `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the previous condition. `count` has been increased by 2 and is less than or equal to `int(inp[0]) - 2`. `same` remains empty. `a` still contains input values. `i` is 1. `inp[1]` is greater than 0**
