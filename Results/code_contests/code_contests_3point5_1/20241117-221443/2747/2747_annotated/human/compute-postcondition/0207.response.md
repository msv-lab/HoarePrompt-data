Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is appended with a list containing elements from `order[i]` and `order[count]`. Since `count` is 1, `temp` will be appended with the list `[order[i], order[1]]`. The `lol` list remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: count is 1, `temp` contains the list `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **count is 1, `temp` contains the list `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` is an empty list**
