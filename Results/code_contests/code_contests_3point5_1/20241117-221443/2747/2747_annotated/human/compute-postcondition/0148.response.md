Output State: **`inp[1]` is greater than 0, `order` is a list, `same` contains elements based on the loop conditions, `a` contains input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has completed incremented by 1, `count` is either incremented or set to a value based on conditions, `temp` contains a new list with `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]`, `count` is 0, `lol` appends `temp[0][0]`, `temp[0]` and `lol` are not in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the loop breaks, and `same` appends `temp[0]`.**
