Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `order` contains elements added from list `a` starting at index `c`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list containing the input values split by spaces, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is increased by 1 or 2 and is less than or equal to `int(inp[0])`. If `c` is the index of the last element in list `a`, `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is increased by 1.***
