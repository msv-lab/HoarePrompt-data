Example Answer: 
A list containing elements `[order[i], order[count]]` is appended to the `temp` list. The current state of `order[i]` and `order[count]` is unknown. Therefore, after execution, the `temp` list will have one new element. The current state of the `lol` list remains the same.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one new element, `lol` is an empty list**
