According to the provided information, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

State: **`order` is a list, `same` is an empty list, `a` contains input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is increased by the number of iterations of the loop, if `c` reaches the index of the last element in list `a`, it will be reset to 0, if `count` is equal to or greater than `int(inp[0])`, the loop will terminate, if `inp[0]` is negative or `count` is already greater than `int(inp[0])`, the loop will not execute.**

This adjustment ensures that the loop can execute based on the given conditions and requirements.
