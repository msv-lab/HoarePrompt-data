Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `count` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 3, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains the appended value from `temp`.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains the appended value from `temp`**
