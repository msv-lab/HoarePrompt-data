Postcondition: ***count is 1, `temp` contains the list `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` contains the second element of the second element of `order` along with the value at `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value present in `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.***
