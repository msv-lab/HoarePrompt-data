Output State: **`inp[1]` is greater than 0, `order` is a list, `same` contains elements based on the loop conditions, `a` contains input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has completed incremented by 1, `count` is either incremented or set to a value based on conditions, `temp` contains the appended values of `[order[i], order[count]]`, if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` is empty, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is increased by 1. If `len(same)` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1, `lol` appends the second element of the first item in `temp`. `lol` appends the first element of the first item in `temp`.**
