Postcondition: ***`temp` and `lol` are empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are emptied, and `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value in `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. `same` appends `temp[0]`.***
