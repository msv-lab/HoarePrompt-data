Example Answer:
`temp` contains the list `[order[i], order[1]]`, where `order` is a list. `temp[0][1]` selects the second element of the first element of `temp`, which is `order[i][1]`. Since `i` is 1, `order[1][1]` selects the second element of the second element of `order`. The value of `order[1][1]` is appended to `lol`. Therefore, the Output State is: count is 1, `temp` contains the list `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` contains the second element of the second element of `order`.
Output State: **count is 1, `temp` contains the list `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` contains the second element of the second element of `order`**
