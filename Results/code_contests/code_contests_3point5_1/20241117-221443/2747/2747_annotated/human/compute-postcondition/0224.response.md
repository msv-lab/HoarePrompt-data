Example Answer: 
The value of `temp` is `[[order[i], order[2]]]`, where `order[i]` and `order[2]` are unknown. `lol` contains the value of `order[2]`, which is unknown as well. After executing `lol.append(temp[0][0])`, the value at `temp[0][0]` is appended to `lol`. Since the values of `order[i]` and `order[2]` are unknown, the output state is: `count` is 2, `temp` is `[[order[i], order[2]]]`, `lol` contains the value of `order[2]` and the appended value.
Output State: **`count` is 2, `temp` is `[[order[i], order[2]]]`, `lol` contains the value of `order[2]` and the appended value**
