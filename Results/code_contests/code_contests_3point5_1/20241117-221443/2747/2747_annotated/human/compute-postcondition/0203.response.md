Example Answer: 
The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list. The variables `count` and `temp` remain unchanged, and `same` is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` is unchanged, program continues without breaking out of any loop or if statement.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` is unchanged, program continues without breaking out of any loop or if statement**
