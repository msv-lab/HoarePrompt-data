Postcondition: ***`order` is a list, `same` is a list with elements, `a` contains input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is increased by 1 or 2 based on the condition, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` length does not equal `int(inp[1])`, `count` is less than the length of `order`, and `lol` contains the appended element from `temp[0][0]`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is present in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. If neither condition is met, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
