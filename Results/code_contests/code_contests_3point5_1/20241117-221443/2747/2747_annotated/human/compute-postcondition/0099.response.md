Postcondition: ***`order` is a list, `same` is a list with elements, `a` contains input values split by spaces, `c` is between 0 and the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the condition, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is either an empty list or contains the first element of the list in `temp[0][1]` with the appended value of `temp[0][0]`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp`, `lol` are reset, `count` is increased by 1, and the loop continues. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the first element of `temp` is appended to `same`, `temp`, `lol` are reset, and `count` is increased by 1.***
