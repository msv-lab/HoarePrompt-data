Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, initially 2. `temp` is a list containing the elements `order[i]` and `order[2]`. `lol` contains the value of `order[2]` and the appended value. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` become empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, the execution breaks. In the else part, `count` is increased by 1, `temp` and `lol` become empty lists, and the value from `temp[0]` is appended to `same`.***
