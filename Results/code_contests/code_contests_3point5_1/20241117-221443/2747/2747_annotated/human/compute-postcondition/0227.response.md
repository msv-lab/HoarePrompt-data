Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so `count` becomes 3. The other variables `temp` and `lol` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
