Example Answer:
The value `temp[0][0]` is added to the list `lol`. The initial state shows that `temp` contains the list `[order[i], order[1]]` and `lol` contains the second element of the second element of `order`. After the execution, the value at `temp[0][0]` is added to `lol`. 
Output State: **count is 1, `temp` contains the list `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` contains the second element of the second element of `order` along with the value at `temp[0][0]`**
