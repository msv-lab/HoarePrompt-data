Postcondition: ***count is 2, temp is an empty list, lol is an empty list. In the if part, if temp[0] is in same or lol is in same, temp and lol are emptied, count is increased by 1. In the else part, if the length of same is equal to the integer value in inp at index 1, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the value in temp[0] is appended to same, temp and lol are emptied, and count is increased by 1.***
