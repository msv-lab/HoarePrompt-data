Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of subsequences of b that meet the given conditions. The logic in the program is not aligned with the problem description. The program seems to be iterating over the elements of the 'order' list and creating subsequences, but the implementation is incorrect.

Additionally, the program seems to be using 'same' and 'order' lists to store subsequences, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Therefore, based on the mismatch between the program logic and the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be false.
