Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through the input string `s`, maintaining a stack to keep track of the characters. It correctly removes the leftmost occurrence of `ST` by popping the stack when encountering a `T` character that has a corresponding `S` character at the top of the stack. The final length of the stack is then printed, which represents the eventual length of the string after all `ST` pairs have been removed. 

The program follows the problem description for every potential case and correctly handles all possible scenarios based on the given constraints.
