Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It processes the input string `X` by removing the leftmost occurrence of `ST` as a contiguous substring until no more occurrences are left. The program maintains a stack to keep track of the processed characters and prints the eventual length of the string `X`, which is the length of the stack after processing. The logic of the program ensures that it handles the specified conditions correctly, resulting in the expected output for all given inputs.
