The function `func` reads input from the user, processes the input string `s` character by character, and manipulates a stack based on certain conditions. The stack is modified based on the characters in the input string according to the rules specified in the code. At the end, the function prints the length of the stack. The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is not explicitly defined.
