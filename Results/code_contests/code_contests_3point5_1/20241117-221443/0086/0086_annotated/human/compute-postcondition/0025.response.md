Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, s is of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters. If the length of stack is 0 or the character at index i in s is 'S', then the character at index i in s is appended to stack and i is updated to the next index in s. In all other cases, the program continues without any changes.***
