Example Answer: 
The character at index i in string s is appended to the stack. Since i is the next index in the string s, the character at index i is the next character in s. Therefore, the character at index i in string s is appended to the stack. The length of the stack increases by 1. 
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, s is of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, stack contains the appended character at index i in s, i is updated to the next index in s**
