Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, s is of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters. If the length of stack is 0 or the character at index i in s is 'S', then the character at index i in s is appended to stack and i is updated to the next index in s. In all other cases, if the character at the top of the stack is 'S', it is removed from the stack. Otherwise, the character at index i in s is appended to the stack.***
