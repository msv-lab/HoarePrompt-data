Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, s is of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, stack is a list containing the character at index i in s if len(stack) == 0 or the character at index i in s is 'S', i is incremented by 1. If len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S', the character at index i in s is appended to the stack and i is increased by 1. If s[i] == 'T' and the last element in stack is 'S', then the last element is removed from the stack. If s[i] == 'T' and the last element in stack is not 'S', then the character at index i in s is appended to the stack.***
