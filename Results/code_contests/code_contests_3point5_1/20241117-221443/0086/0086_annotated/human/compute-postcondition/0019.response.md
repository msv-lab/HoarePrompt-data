Output State: **X is a string of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, s is of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, stack is a list containing the character at index i in s if len(stack) == 0 or the character at index i in s is 'S', i is incremented by 1. If len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S', the character at index i in s is appended to the stack and i is increased by 1. If neither condition is met, no changes occur. The character at index i in s is appended to the stack.**
