Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is of even length with half 'S' and half 'T' characters, stack is a list containing the character at index i in s if len(stack) == 0 or the character at index i in s is 'S', i is 0. If len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S', the character at index i in s is appended to stack. Otherwise, no changes are made to the stack. After the if condition, the character at index i in s (which is 'T') is not appended to the stack and the last element of the stack is 'S'.***
