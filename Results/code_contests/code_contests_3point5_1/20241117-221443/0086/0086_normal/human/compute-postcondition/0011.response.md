Example Answer: 
If the character at index i of s is 'S', it will be added to the stack. If the character at index i of s is 'T' or the stack is empty or the character at index i of s is not 'S', the stack remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, stack contains the character at index i of s if it is 'S' or stack is unchanged if len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S' is false. The character at index i of s is 'T' and stack is unchanged after execution of the code.
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, stack contains the character at index i of s if it is 'S' or stack is unchanged if len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S' is false. The character at index i of s is 'T' and stack is unchanged**
