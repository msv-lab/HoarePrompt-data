Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, i is less than the length of string s, and stack contains the character from string s at index i if len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S'. After the execution of the if-else block, the stack maintains the property that it contains the character from string s at index i if len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S'. If s[i] == 'T' and stack[-1] == 'S', the top element is removed from the stack. If s[i] == 'T' and stack[-1] is not 'S', the character at index i of string s is added to the stack. No changes occur if the conditions are not met.***
