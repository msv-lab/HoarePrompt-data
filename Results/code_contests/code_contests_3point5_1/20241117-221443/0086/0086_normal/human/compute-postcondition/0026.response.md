Example Answer:
The `pop()` function removes and returns the last character from `stack`. If the condition mentioned earlier is met, the last character from `stack` is removed. If the condition is not met, no changes occur. Therefore, the Output State is: *X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, i is less than the length of string s, and stack contains the character from string s at index i if len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S'.
Output State: ***X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, i is less than the length of string s, and stack contains the character from string s at index i if len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S'.***
