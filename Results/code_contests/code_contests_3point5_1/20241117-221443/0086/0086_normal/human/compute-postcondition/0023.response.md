Example Answer:
The code appends the character at index `i` of string `s` to the `stack`. Since `i` is less than the length of string `s`, the character at index `i` exists. The `stack` now contains the character from string `s` at index `i` added to it.
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, i is less than the length of string s, stack contains the character from string s at index i**
