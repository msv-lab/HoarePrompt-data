Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, i is less than the length of string s. If the length of stack is 0 or the character at index i in string s is 'S', then the character at index i is appended to stack. Otherwise, if the character at the top of the stack is 'S', it is removed. In all other cases, no changes are made to the stack.***
