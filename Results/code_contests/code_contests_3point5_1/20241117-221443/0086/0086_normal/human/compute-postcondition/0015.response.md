Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of string `s` is appended to the `stack`. As `s` has an even length and `i` is less than the length of `s`, the operation is valid. The previously unknown state of the stack is now updated with the value of `s[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, i is less than the length of string s, and the stack has been updated with the value of s[i].
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, i is less than the length of string s, and the stack has been updated with the value of s[i]**
