Example Answer:
The input is stored in variable `s`. Since `s` is initialized as a string of even length with half 'S' and half 'T', the value of `s` remains the same after input is taken.
Output State: **X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T'; s is the input string**
