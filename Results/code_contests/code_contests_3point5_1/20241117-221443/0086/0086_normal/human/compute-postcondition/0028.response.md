Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length. If the condition stack[-1] == 'S' is true, the top element is removed from stack. Otherwise, the character at index i of string s is added to the stack. In both cases, the stack maintains the property that it contains the character from string s at index i if len(stack) == 0 or s[i] == 'S'.***
