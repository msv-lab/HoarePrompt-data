Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length. If the character at index i of s is 'S' and the stack is not empty, then the top element of the stack is removed. If the character at index i of s is 'S' and the stack is empty or the character at index i of s is not 'S', then the character at index i of s is appended to the stack. If the character at index i of s is 'T', the stack remains unchanged. Additionally, the resulting stack after the if statement executes retains the conditions stated in the precondition.***
