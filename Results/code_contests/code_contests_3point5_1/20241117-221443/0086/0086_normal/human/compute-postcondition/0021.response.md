Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length with half the characters being 'S' and the other half being 'T', s is an input string with even length, i is less than the length of string s. If the length of stack is 0 or the character at index i in string s is 'S', then the character at index i is appended to stack. If the character at index i in string s is 'T' and the top of the stack is 'S', then 'S' is removed from the stack. Otherwise, no changes are made to the stack.***
