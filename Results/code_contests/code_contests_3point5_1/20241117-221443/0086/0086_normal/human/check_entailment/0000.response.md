Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads an input string `s` and processes it exactly as described in the problem description. It checks for occurrences of 'ST' in the string and removes the leftmost one if found. The resulting length of the stack after processing the string is then printed. The code handles all cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code functionality and do not suggest any additional cases that are not covered by the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
