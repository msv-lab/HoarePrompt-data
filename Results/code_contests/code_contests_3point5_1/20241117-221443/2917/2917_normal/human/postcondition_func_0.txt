The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `numbers`. It then calculates the number of coins needed based on the absolute values of the integers in the list. If there is an odd number of negative integers, it adjusts the number of coins needed by adding the count of zeros in the list or 2 if there are no zeros. Finally, it prints the total number of coins needed. The function operates under the assumption that `n` is a positive integer and `numbers` is a list of integers.
