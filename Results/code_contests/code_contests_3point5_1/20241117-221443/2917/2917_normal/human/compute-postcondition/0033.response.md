Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer. `num_zeros`, `needed_coins`, and `neg` have been adjusted based on the conditions met during the execution of the if-else block. If `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` is updated by adding `num_zeros`. If `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is updated by adding 2. After the execution of the if-else block, `neg` is not divisible by 2. In the case where `numbers` is empty, `num_zeros`, `needed_coins`, and `neg` remain 0.***
