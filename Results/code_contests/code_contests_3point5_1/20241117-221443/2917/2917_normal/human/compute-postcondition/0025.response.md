Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two integers. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. If `num` is not 0, `needed_coins` is updated by subtracting 1 less than the absolute value of `num`. Additionally, if `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1. The values of `num_zeros`, `needed_coins`, and `neg` may have been modified based on the execution of the if else block.***
