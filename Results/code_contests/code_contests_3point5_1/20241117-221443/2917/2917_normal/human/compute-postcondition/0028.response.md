Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer. During each iteration, if `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is updated by subtracting 1 less than the absolute value of `num`. The values of `num_zeros`, `needed_coins`, and `neg` are adjusted based on the conditions met during the execution of the if-else block. If the list `numbers` is empty, the loop does not execute and `num_zeros`, `needed_coins`, and `neg` remain 0. After entering the if condition, the `neg` is not divisible by 2.***
