Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input which must be converted to an integer. The variable `n` will now hold the integer value input by the user. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, numbers is a list of integers with length n. Each element in numbers is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9, inclusive.**
