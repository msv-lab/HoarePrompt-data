According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `numbers` must have at least one integer. At the start of the loop, `num` will take the value of the first integer in the list `numbers`. Since `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` are not directly used in the loop and there are no conditions related to them in the loop, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0**
