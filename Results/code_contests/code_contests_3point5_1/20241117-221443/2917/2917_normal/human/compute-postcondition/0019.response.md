Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two integers. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1. If `num` is not 0, `needed_coins` is increased by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. `neg` is updated based on the conditions met during the execution of the if-else block for the last `num`, where if `num` is negative, `neg` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `neg`.***
