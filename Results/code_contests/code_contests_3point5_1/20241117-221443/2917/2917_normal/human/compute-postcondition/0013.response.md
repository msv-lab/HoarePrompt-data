Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer. If `num` is negative, `neg` is increased by 1. After the execution of the if-else block, `num_zeros` is increased by 1 if `num` is 0, otherwise `needed_coins` is increased by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. The values of `num_zeros`, `needed_coins`, `neg`, and `numbers` are updated accordingly based on the conditions met during the execution of the if-else block.***
