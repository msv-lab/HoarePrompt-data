The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the **Precondition** that `n` is a positive integer and `numbers` is a list of integers with length `n`, where each element in `numbers` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9, inclusive. The function operates based on these preconditions but does not explicitly take any input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. It operates based on the precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `numbers` is a list of integers with specific constraints.**
