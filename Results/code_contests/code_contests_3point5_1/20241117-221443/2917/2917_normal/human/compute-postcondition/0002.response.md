Example Answer:
`neg` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables `n` and `numbers` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with length `n`, `neg` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with length `n`, `neg` is 0**
