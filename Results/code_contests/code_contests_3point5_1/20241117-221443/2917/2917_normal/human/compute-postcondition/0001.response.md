Example Answer:
The `map` function converts each element in the input list to an integer. Since `numbers` is a list of integers, the values in the list will be updated accordingly. The length of the list remains the same, which is `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with length `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with length `n`**
