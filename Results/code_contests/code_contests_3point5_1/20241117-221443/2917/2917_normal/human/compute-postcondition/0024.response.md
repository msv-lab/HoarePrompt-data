Example Answer:
`needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. The value of `num` is not given in the initial state, so the exact increment cannot be determined. The previous states of other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` may have been modified based on the last iteration. If `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` may have been modified based on the last iteration. If `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1**
