Example Answer:
`neg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `neg` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` may have been modified based on the last iteration, `neg` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` may have been modified based on the last iteration, `neg` has been incremented by 1**
