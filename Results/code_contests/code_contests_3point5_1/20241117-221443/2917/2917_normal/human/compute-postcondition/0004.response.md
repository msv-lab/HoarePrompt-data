Example Answer: 
`needed_coins` is assigned the value 0. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with length `n`, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with length `n`, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0**
