Example Answer:
The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `neg` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `neg` is increased by 1, `num_zeros` may change based on the presence of zeros, `needed_coins` may change based on the value of `num`**
