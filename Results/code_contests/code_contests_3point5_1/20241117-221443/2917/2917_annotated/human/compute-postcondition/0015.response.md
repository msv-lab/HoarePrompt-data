Example Answer:
The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `neg` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `neg` is increased by 1**
