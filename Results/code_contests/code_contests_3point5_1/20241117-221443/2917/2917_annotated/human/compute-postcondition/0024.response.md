Example Answer: 
The value of `needed_coins` is increased by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. The value of `num` can be positive or negative, and the number of coins needed will be affected accordingly. If `num` is negative, `neg` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `neg` may be increased by 1 if `num` is negative, `num_zeros` may change based on the presence of zeros, and `needed_coins` is updated based on the value of `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `neg` may be increased by 1 if `num` is negative, `num_zeros` may change based on the presence of zeros, and `needed_coins` is updated based on the value of `num`**
