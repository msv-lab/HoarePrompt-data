Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. The loop iterates through each `num` in `numbers`. If `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. If `num` is not 0, `needed_coins` is updated by subtracting 1 from the absolute value of `num`. If `numbers` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and all variables remain as 0. The number of negative elements in `numbers` is odd. The number of zeros in `numbers` is 0. `needed_coins` is incremented by 2.**
