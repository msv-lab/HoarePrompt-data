Postcondition: ***If `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, the loop will iterate through each `num` in `numbers`. If `num` is negative, `neg` is incremented by 1. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. If `num` is not 0, `needed_coins` is updated by subtracting 1 from the absolute value of `num`. If `numbers` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and all variables remain as 0. In this case, `neg` is an even number***
