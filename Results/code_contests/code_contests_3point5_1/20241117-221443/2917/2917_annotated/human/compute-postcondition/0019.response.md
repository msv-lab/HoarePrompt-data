Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If there exists a negative number in the list, `neg` is increased by 1. The list `numbers` and the variable `neg` may change accordingly based on the presence of negative numbers. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is updated by subtracting 1 from the absolute value of `num`.***
