Example Answer:
`neg` is assigned the value 0. The value of `neg` is now 0. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of n integers such that -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in numbers; n is an input integer, `neg` is 0.
Output State: **numbers is a list of n integers such that -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in numbers; n is an input integer, `neg` is 0**
