Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. If the first element `num` in `numbers` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1. In all other cases, `neg` remains 0. If `num` is equal to 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1 and `needed_coins` remains unchanged. If `num` is not equal to 0, `neg` remains 0, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged, and `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1.***
