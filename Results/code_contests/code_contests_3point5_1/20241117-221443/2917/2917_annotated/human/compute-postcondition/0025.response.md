Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements. If `num` is negative, `neg` is increased by 1. If `num` is equal to 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is updated based on the absolute value of `num`. The values of `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` may change depending on the presence of zeros and the value of `num`, respectively.***
