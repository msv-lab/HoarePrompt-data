According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is 0. To ensure the loop executes, `numbers` must have at least 1 element, and the loop variable `num` will take the value of the first element in the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0, `num` is the first element in `numbers`**
