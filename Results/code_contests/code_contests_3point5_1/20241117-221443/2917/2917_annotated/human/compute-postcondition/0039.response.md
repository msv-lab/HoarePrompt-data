Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers. It then calculates the number of coins needed based on the conditions related to negative numbers and zeros in the list. The function increments the `needed_coins` variable based on the number of negative elements and zeros in the list following specific rules. Finally, it prints the total number of coins needed. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
