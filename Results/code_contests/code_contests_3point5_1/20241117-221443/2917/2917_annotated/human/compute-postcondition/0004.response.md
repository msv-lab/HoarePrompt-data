Example Answer: 
`needed_coins` is assigned the value 0. The values of `numbers`, `neg`, and `num_zeros` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of n integers such that -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in numbers; n is an input integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0.
Output State: **numbers is a list of n integers such that -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in numbers; n is an input integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0**
