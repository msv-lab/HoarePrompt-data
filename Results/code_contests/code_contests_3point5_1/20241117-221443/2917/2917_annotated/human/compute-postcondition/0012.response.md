Example Answer:
The program fragment increments `needed_coins` by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. The initial state states that if the first element `num` in `numbers` is not equal to 0, `neg` remains 0. `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged. Therefore, after the execution of the program fragment, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, if the first element `num` in `numbers` is not equal to 0, `neg` remains 0, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged, and `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, if the first element `num` in `numbers` is not equal to 0, `neg` remains 0, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged, and `needed_coins` is incremented by the absolute value of `num` minus 1**
