Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of n integers such that -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in numbers; `n` is the input integer.
Output State: **numbers is a list of n integers such that -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in numbers; `n` is the input integer**
