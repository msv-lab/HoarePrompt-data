Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program checks if there are any pairs of blogs with the same topic, as this violates the condition that each blog must cover a different topic. If it finds such a pair, it returns -1. Otherwise, it generates a string of numbers from 1 to n, indicating the order in which Johnny should write the blogs. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, ensuring that Johnny follows the rules for selecting topics based on the topics covered by his neighbors. The program handles the input and output as described in the problem statement. Since no cases have been provided where the program does not work correctly, we can conclude that the program is correct.
