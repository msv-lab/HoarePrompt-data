The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. It iterates through the tuples in `arr`, checking if the elements at specific indices in the `topic` array are equal. If any such equality is found, it returns -1. If no equal elements are found after the loop, the function returns a string of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), separated by spaces. The loop also handles cases where the indices `a` or `b` are out of bounds of the array.
