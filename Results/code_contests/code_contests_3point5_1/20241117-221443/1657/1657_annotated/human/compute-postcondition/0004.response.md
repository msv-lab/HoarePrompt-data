Since the loop executes based on the elements in the `arr` array, we need to focus on the values of `a` and `b` at the end of the previous iteration to determine if the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, if the element at index `a - 1` is not equal to the element at index `b - 1`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, the values of `a` and `b` need to be adjusted so that the condition of the loop is met.

State: **`topic` is an array. If the element at index `a` - 1 is not equal to the element at index `b` - 1, the loop will continue. No other changes are necessary.**
