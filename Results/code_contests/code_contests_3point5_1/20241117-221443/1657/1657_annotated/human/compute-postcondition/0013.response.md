The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. `n` and `m` are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 5*10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 5*10^5. `arr` is a list of m tuples where each tuple contains two integers a and b such that a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n. `topic` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the desired topic number of the corresponding blog, and each integer is between 1 and n inclusive.

Case_1: The function checks if the element at index `a - 1` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` in the `topic` array. If they are equal, the function returns -1. Otherwise, if the loop finishes executing without encountering any such case, no changes are made to the array `topic`. The loop also handles cases where `a` or `b` are out of bounds of the array.

Case_2: If the loop in Case_1 finishes executing without encountering any equal elements, the program returns a string of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), separated by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n` and `m`, a list of tuples `arr`, and a list of integers `topic`, and check for equality between elements at specific indices in the `topic` array. If any such equality is found, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), separated by spaces.
