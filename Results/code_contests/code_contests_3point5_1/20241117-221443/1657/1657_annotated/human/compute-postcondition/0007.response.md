According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a` and `b` should represent valid indices within the `topic` array. At the end of the last iteration, the state is `topic` is an array. If the element at index `a` - 1 is equal to the element at index `b` - 1, the program returns -1. This means for the loop to continue, the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` should not be equal. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a - 1` and `b - 1` should represent valid indices within the `topic` array and the elements at those indices should not be equal.
State: **`topic` is an array, elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` are not equal, where `a - 1` and `b - 1` are valid indices within the array**
