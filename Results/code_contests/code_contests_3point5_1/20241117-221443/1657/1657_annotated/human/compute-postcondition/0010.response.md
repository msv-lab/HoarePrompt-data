According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` of the array `topic`. If these elements are not equal, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` are not equal. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` must still not be equal.
State: **`topic` is an array, elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` are not equal**
