Postcondition: ***`topic` is an array. If the element at index `a` - 1 is equal to the element at index `b` - 1, the program returns -1. Otherwise, if the element at index `a` - 1 is not equal to the element at index `b` - 1, the loop continues without any changes to the array. The program handles the case where `a` or `b` are out of bounds of the array.***
