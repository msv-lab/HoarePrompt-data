Output State: **`topic` is an array. If the element at index `a - 1` is equal to the element at index `b - 1`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, if the loop finishes executing without encountering any such case, no changes are made to the array `topic`. The loop handles cases where `a` or `b` are out of bounds of the array.**
