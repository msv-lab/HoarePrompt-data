Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly and stores the information about the blogs, references, and desired topics.
2. The `func_1` function checks if there are any references between blogs that have the same desired topic, and returns -1 if there are any such references. Otherwise, it returns the order in which Johnny should write the blogs.
3. The program then prints the output according to the specified format.
4. The program logic aligns with the problem description provided. It correctly handles the case where Johnny needs to write the blogs in an order such that no two connected blogs have the same desired topic.
