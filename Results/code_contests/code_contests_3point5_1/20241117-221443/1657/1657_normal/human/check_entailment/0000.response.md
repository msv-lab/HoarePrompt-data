Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be following the problem description correctly. The function `func_1` iterates through the pairs in `arr` and checks if the topics of the referenced blogs are the same. If they are the same, it returns -1, as expected. If the pairs have different topics or if `arr` is empty, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces, which aligns with the problem description. The code handles the case where the topics of referenced blogs are the same, ensuring that Johnny follows the rule of choosing a topic not covered by neighbors. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the code is correct by providing an overview of the function's logic.
