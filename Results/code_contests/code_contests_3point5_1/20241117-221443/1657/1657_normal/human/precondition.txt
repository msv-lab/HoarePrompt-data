**Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5*10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 5*10^5. The input graph is a list of m pairs of integers a and b where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. The input topic list contains n integers where each integer represents the desired topic number for the corresponding blog, and 1 ≤ t_i ≤ n.**
