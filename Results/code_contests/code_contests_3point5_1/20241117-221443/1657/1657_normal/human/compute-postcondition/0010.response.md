According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the topic list at indexes a - 1 and b - 1. If the elements at those indexes are not equal, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, the topic list contains elements indexed by a and b where the element at index a - 1 is not equal to the element at index b - 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the elements at indexes a - 1 and b - 1 must still not be equal.
State: **The topic list contains elements indexed by a and b where the element at index a - 1 is not equal to the element at index b - 1.**
