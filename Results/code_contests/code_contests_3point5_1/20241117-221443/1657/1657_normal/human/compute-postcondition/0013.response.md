The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. 

**Precondition**: `n` is the number of blogs (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is the number of references (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), `arr` is a list of `m` tuples representing references between blogs, each tuple containing two integers `a` and `b` (a ≠ b; 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n), `topic` is a list of `n` integers representing the desired topic number for each blog (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n).

Case_1: If the topics of the blogs referenced in `arr` are the same, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `arr` is empty, no action is taken, and the variables remain unchanged.

Case_2: The program returns a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`, and based on the conditions specified, either return -1 or a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.
