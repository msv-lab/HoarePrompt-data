According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `arr`. If the element at index `a - 1` is equal to the element at index `b - 1`, the loop does not execute further. At the end of the last iteration, the topic list contains elements indexed by `a` and `b`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the elements at index `a - 1` and index `b - 1` must not be equal.
State: **The topic list contains elements indexed by `a` and `b` where the element at index `a - 1` is not equal to the element at index `b - 1**.
