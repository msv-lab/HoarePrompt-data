Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the number of datasets and processes each dataset accordingly.
- The `func_1` function modifies the `surface` as described in the problem statement by setting the element at index `[y][x]` to 0 and then recursively calling itself for the adjacent bombs.
- The code outputs the final plane state for each dataset in the required format.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any case where the program does not follow the problem description. The code seems to handle all the edge cases and requirements specified in the problem statement.
