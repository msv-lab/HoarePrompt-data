Example Answer:
The `end` variable is assigned the value of `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise it is assigned the value of 8. Since the surface was updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded, the previous values of `x` and `y` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded, `end` is either `x + 4` or 8.
Output State: **surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded, `end` is either `x + 4` or 8**
