According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and the condition `surface[y][i]` being True for at least one `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is less than `end`, there exists at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True, and `end` is assigned the value of y + 4 if y + 4 < 8 else 8. Also, if `surface[i][x]` is True, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` has been called. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since the loop is iterating from `start` to `end`, `start` should be incremented by 1.
2. If `end` was assigned the value of y + 4, then it needs to be modified to y + 5 if y + 5 < 8 else 8 in order for the loop to execute again.
3. If `surface[i][x]` is True for the next iteration, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` will be called again.

State: **`start` is less than `end` + 1, there exists at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True, `end` is assigned the value of y + 5 if y + 5 < 8 else 8, if `surface[i][x]` is True, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` has been called**
