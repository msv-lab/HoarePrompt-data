Output State: **The loop iterates through the range from start to end, and if the element at index i in the y-th row of surface is True, then func_1(surface, i, y) is called. If start is greater than or equal to end, the loop does not execute. If surface[y][i] is False for all i in the range, func_1 is not called and there is no change in the surface. `end` is assigned the value of y + 4 if y + 4 < 8 else 8.**
