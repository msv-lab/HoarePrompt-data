According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and the condition `surface[y][i]`. At the end of the last iteration, the surface is updated with the bomb exploded at coordinates (i + 4 or 8, y), where the end value is either i + 4 or 8. The start value is less than the updated end value. If `surface[y][i]` is true, then `func_1` is called with the updated surface, i, and y parameters.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. The start value should be updated to be less than the updated end value.
2. If `surface[y][i]` is true, then `func_1` is called with the updated surface, i, and y parameters.

State: **The surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (i + 4 or 8, y) exploded. The end value is either i + 4 or 8, and the start value is less than the updated end value. If the condition `surface[y][i]` is true, then `func_1` is called with the updated surface, i, and y parameters. Otherwise, there is no change in the surface.**
