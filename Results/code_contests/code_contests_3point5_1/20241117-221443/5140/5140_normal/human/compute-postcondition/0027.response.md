According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is less than `end` + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is less than `end` + 1. There exists at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True. `end` is assigned the value of y + 5 if y + 5 < 8 else 8. If `surface[i][x]` is True, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` has been called. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `start` remains less than `end` + 1.
- `end` should be adjusted based on the new value of `y` for the next iteration. If `y + 5 < 8`, then `end` should be assigned the value of y + 5. Otherwise, `end` should be 8.
- There should be at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True for the next iteration to occur.
- If `surface[i][x]` is True for any `i` in the next iteration, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` should have been called.

State: **`start` is less than `end` + 1. There exists at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True. `end` should be adjusted based on the value of y for the next iteration. If `y + 5 < 8`, then `end` is assigned the value of y + 5, otherwise `end` is 8. If `surface[i][x]` is True for any i in the next iteration, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` has been called.**
