Output State: **If start is greater than or equal to end, the loop does not execute. If surface[y][i] is False for all i in the range, func_1 is not called and there is no change in the surface. Otherwise, for each i in the range from `start` to `end`, if `surface[i][x]` is True, `func_1(surface, x, i)` has been called. `end` is assigned the value of y + 4 if y + 4 < 8 else 8.**
