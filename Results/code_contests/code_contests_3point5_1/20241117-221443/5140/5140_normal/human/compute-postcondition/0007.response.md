According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded, where the end value is either x + 4 or 8, and the start value is less than or equal to end. If the element at index i in the y-th row of surface is True, then func_1(surface, i, y) is called.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the start value should be less than the updated end value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded, the end value is either x + 4 or 8, the start value is less than the updated end value.**
