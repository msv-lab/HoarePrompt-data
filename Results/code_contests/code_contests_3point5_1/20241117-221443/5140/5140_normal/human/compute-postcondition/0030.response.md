Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. It modifies the `surface` by setting the element at index `[y][x]` to 0. Then, it iterates through the rows and columns within a specific range around the coordinates `x` and `y`. If the element at a particular index is True, it recursively calls `func_1` with updated coordinates. The function does not have a return value.**
