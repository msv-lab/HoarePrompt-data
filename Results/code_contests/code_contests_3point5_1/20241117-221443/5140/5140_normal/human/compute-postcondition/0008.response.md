Example Answer:
The function `func_1` takes in `surface`, `i`, and `y` as parameters. It updates the `surface` with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded, where the x value is either `i + 4` or 8. Given that the end value is greater than the start value, the output state after running the function is: Surface is updated with the bomb exploded at coordinates (i + 4 or 8, y).
Output State: **Surface is updated with the bomb exploded at coordinates (i + 4 or 8, y)**
