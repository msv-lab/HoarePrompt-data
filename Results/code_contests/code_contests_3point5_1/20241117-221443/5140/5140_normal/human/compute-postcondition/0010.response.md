According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (i + 4 or 8, y) exploded. The end value is either i + 4 or 8, and the start value is less than the updated end value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the start value needs to be updated to be less than the updated end value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (i + 4 or 8, y) exploded. The end value is either i + 4 or 8, and the start value is less than the updated end value**
