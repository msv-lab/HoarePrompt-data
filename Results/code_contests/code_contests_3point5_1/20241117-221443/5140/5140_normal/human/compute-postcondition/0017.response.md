According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start`, `end`, `y`, and the content of `surface`. 

1. If `start` is less than `end`, the loop can execute.
2. If there exists at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True, then the loop will call `func_1(surface, i, y)`.
3. If `surface[y][i]` is False for all `i` in the range, then `func_1` is not called.

Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **`start` is less than `end`, there exists at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True, `end` is assigned the value of y + 4 if y + 4 < 8 else 8**.
