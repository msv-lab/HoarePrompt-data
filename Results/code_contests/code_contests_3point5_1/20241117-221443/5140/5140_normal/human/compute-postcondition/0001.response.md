Example Answer: 
The variable `start` is assigned the value of `x - 3` if `x - 3` is greater than 0, otherwise it is assigned 0. Since the initial state mentions that the bomb exploded at coordinates (x, y), and there is no information about the specific values of x and y, the calculation of `start` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded.
Output State: **surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded**
