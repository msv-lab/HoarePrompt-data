Postcondition: ***The surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (i + 4 or 8, y) exploded. The end value is either i + 4 or 8, and the start value is less than the updated end value. If the condition `surface[y][i]` is true, then `func_1` is called with the updated surface, i, and y parameters. Otherwise, there is no change in the surface.***
