According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is less than `end` + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is less than `end` + 1. There also needs to be at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True for the loop to continue. Additionally, `end` is assigned the value of y + 5 if y + 5 < 8 else 8. If `surface[i][x]` is True, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` has been called. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `start` value needs to be adjusted according to the condition, and `end` needs to be adjusted based on the given condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`start` is less than `end` + 1, there exists at least one `i` such that `surface[y][i]` is True, `end` is assigned the value of y + 5 if y + 5 < 8 else 8. If `surface[i][x]` is True, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` has been called.**
