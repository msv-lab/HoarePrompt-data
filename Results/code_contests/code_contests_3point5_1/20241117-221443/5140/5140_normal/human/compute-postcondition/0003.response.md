According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `end` is greater than or equal to `start`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded does not affect the loop execution, so it needs to be adjusted to `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
State: **surface is updated with the bomb at coordinates (x, y) exploded, `end` is either `x + 4` or 8, `start` is less than or equal to `end`**
