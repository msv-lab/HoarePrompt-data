The function `func_1` takes in a 2D list `surface`, and coordinates `x` and `y` representing the position of a bomb. It sets the value at the specified coordinates in `surface` to 0. Then, it iterates over a range centered around `x` and `y`, calling itself recursively on neighboring elements in the `surface` that are non-zero. This process is repeated for both row-wise and column-wise neighboring elements. The function does not have a specified return value.
