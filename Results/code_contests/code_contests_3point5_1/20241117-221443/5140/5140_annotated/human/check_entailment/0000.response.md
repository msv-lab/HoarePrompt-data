Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a recursive function `func_1` to simulate the chain reaction of bomb explosions on a plane. The function correctly updates the state of the plane by recursively exploding bombs in the adjacent squares. The logic for handling the bounds of the plane and checking adjacent squares is correctly implemented. The program follows the problem description accurately and produces the expected output. There are no edge cases identified where the program fails to work as described.
