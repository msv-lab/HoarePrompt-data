Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `surface`, `i`, and `y`. The function may update the values within the `surface` 2D list based on certain conditions. The values of `i` and `y` are used within the function, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state after running the function `func_1` is that the `surface` 2D list may have been updated, `i`, `y`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`surface` may be updated, `i`, `y`, `start`, `end` remain unchanged**
