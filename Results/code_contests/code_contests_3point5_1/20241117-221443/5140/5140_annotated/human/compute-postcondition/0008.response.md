Example Answer: 
The function `func_1` updates the value at coordinates (i, y) in the 2D list `surface` to the sum of its current value and the value at coordinates (i+1, y). The initial state of `surface` is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0 and `surface[y][i+1]` is non-zero. After executing `func_1(surface, i, y)`, the value at coordinates (i, y) in `surface` will be updated based on the previous values at coordinates (i, y) and (i+1, y). Other values in the `surface` list remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`surface` is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (i, y) updated according to the function `func_1`**
