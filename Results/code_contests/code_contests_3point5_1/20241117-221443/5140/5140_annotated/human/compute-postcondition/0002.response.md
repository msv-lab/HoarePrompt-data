Example Answer:
The value of `end` is assigned as `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8, otherwise it is set to 8. As the initial state mentions that the value at coordinates (x,y) is set to 0, the value of `x` is unknown, so the value of `end` can be either `x + 4` if `x + 4` is less than 8 or 8. Therefore, the Output State is: surface is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0, and end is either `x + 4` if `x + 4` < 8 or 8.
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0, and end is either `x + 4` if `x + 4` < 8 or 8**
