According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. If `i` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start` and `end` are such that `end` is greater than `start`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1**.
