Example Answer: 
`func_1` is called with arguments `surface`, `x`, and `i + 1`. The values of `surface` and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`, `i` is `i + 1.
Output State: **No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`, `i` is `i + 1**
