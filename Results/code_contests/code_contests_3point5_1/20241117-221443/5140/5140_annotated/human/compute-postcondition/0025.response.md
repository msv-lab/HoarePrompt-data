Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The value of `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`. The values of `surface`, `x`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1.
Output State: **No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1**
