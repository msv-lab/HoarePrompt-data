Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y`. The function performs some operations on `surface` based on the values of `i` and `y`. The initial state of `surface` is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0. The value at coordinates (y, i) in `surface` is not equal to 0. The function may alter the values in `surface` based on the input parameters. 
Output State: **The state of `surface` may change based on the operations performed by `func_1`**
