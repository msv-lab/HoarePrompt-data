Example Answer:
`start` is assigned the value of `x - 3` if `x - 3 > 0`, otherwise it is assigned 0. The value of `x` is unknown in the initial state, so the exact value of `start` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: surface is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0.
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0**
