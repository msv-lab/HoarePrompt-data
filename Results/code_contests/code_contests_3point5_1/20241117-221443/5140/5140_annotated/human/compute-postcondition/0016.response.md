Example Answer: 
The value of `end` is calculated based on the value of `y`. If `y + 4` is less than 8, then `end` is assigned the value of `y + 4`, otherwise, it is assigned the value of 8. Since the initial state does not mention the value of `y`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `end`. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the `surface` list.
Output State: **No change in the `surface` list**
