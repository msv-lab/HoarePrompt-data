According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If the value of `end` is greater than `start`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `surface` list does not affect the loop execution, so no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.
State: **No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`**
