According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `i < end` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at the end value. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the `end` value needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current `end` value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **surface is a 2D list of integers with potential updates based on the condition. If the element at position (y, i) in surface is truthy, then func_1 is called with surface, i, and y as arguments. The values of i, y, start, and end remain unchanged after the execution.**
