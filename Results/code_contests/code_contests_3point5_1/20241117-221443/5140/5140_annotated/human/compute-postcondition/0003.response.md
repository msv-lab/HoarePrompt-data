According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. In this case, `end` is determined by the value of `x` and must be calculated based on the given condition. So, for the loop to execute, `start` must be less than `end`. Before the loop starts, the value at coordinates (x,y) is set to 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `start` is less than `end` and the value at coordinates (x,y) is set to 0.
State: **`surface` is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0, `start` is less than `end`**
