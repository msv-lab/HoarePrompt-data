Postcondition: ***No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1. If the condition `surface[i][x]` is True, then the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
