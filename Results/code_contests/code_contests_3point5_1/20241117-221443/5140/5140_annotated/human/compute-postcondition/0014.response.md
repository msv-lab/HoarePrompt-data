Output State: **`surface` is a 2D list of integers. If the value at coordinates (i, y) in `surface` is non-zero, then the function `func_1` is applied to update the value at those coordinates. The loop executes from the `start` index to `end` index (exclusive), and `func_1` is called when `surface[y][i]` is truthy. If the loop does not execute (e.g., when `start` is already greater than or equal to `end`), there is no change in the `surface` list.**
