Example Answer:
The value at coordinates (x,y) on the surface is set to 0. The affected variables are surface, x, and y. The value at surface[y][x] is now 0. Therefore, the Output State is: surface is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0.
Output State: **surface is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0**
