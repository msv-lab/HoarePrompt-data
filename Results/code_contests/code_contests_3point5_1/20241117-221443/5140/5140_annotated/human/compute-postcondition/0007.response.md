According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. If `i` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value at `surface[y][i]` is non-zero, which indicates that `func_1` was called with arguments `surface`, `i`, and `y`. This potentially altered the state of `surface`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value at `surface[y][i+1]` should be non-zero, indicating that `func_1` was called in the previous iteration.
State: **`surface` is a 2D list of integers with the value at coordinates (x,y) set to 0, `surface[y][i+1]` is non-zero**
