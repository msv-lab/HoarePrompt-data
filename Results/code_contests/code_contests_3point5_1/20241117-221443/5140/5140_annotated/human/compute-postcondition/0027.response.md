According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `start`, `end`, and the condition `surface[i][x]`. At the end of the last iteration, there is no change in the `surface` list. `start` and `end` are such that `end` is greater than `start`, and `i` is adjusted to `i + 1. If the condition `surface[i][x]` is true, then the function `func_1` is called. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1**
