Output State: **No change in the `surface` list, `start` and `end` such that `end` is greater than `start`. If the element at index `i` of `surface` at position `x` is true, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is executed. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute.**
