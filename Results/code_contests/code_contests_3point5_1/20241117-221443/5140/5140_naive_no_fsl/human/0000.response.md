Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the state of the plane, the position of the first bomb to explode, and outputs the final state of the plane after the chain reaction of explosions. The recursive function `func_1` handles the explosion of bombs according to the given rules and the output format is also as expected. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
