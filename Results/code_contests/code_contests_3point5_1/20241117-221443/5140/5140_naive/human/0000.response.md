Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly, processes it according to the problem description, and outputs the final plane state as expected. The function `func_1` correctly simulates the chain reaction of bombs exploding in the neighboring squares. The recursion in the function handles the blast effect on adjacent squares above, below, left, and right of the bomb. The program iterates through each dataset and produces the final state of the plane accurately. Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
