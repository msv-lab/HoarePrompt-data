The function `func` reads an integer `N` as input, followed by a list of integers `listL` also input by the user. It then calculates the sum of all elements in `listL`, subtracts the maximum value `maxL` from the sum, and compares `maxL` with the updated sum. If the maximum value in `listL` is less than the updated sum, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
