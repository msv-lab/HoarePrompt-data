Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if the longest side of the polygon is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other sides. The logic is implemented correctly by finding the maximum side length, summing up all side lengths, subtracting the maximum side length from the total sum, and then comparing if the maximum side length is less than the updated sum. The program outputs 'Yes' if the condition is satisfied and 'No' otherwise. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected.
