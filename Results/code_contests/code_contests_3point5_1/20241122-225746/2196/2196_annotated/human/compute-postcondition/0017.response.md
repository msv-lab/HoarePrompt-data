Postcondition: ***N is at least 1, listL contains integers based on user input, maxL holds the maximum value from the input list, sum is either updated by subtracting maxL or remains the sum of all elements in listL. If the maximum value in listL is less than the sum, the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, when maxL is greater than or equal to sum, the program prints 'No' without modifying any existing variables.***
