According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `listL` should contain integers based on user input, `maxL` should hold the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` should be initialized to 0. 
State: **`N` is at least 1, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, `sum` is initialized to 0**
