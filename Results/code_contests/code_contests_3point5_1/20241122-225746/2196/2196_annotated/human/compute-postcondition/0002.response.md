Example Answer:
The variable `maxL` is assigned the maximum value from the list `listL`. The list `listL` contains integers based on user input, and `N` is an input integer. After execution, `maxL` will hold the maximum value from the input list. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input integer, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list.
Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list**
