Output State: 
- If `N` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and `sum` will be the sum of all elements in `listL`.
- If `N` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute, and `sum` will remain 0.
- `N` is at least 1, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` is the sum of all elements in `listL`.
