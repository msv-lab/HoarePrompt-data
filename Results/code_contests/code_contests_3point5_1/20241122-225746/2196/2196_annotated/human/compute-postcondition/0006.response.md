According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 1, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` is the sum of all elements in `listL`. To execute the loop one more time, `N` needs to be adjusted to be at least 2.
State: **`N` is at least 2, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` is the sum of all elements in `listL`**
