Example Answer: 
A list `listL` is created by taking input from the user, splitting it, and converting each element to an integer. The initial state has `N` as an input integer, so after the code execution, the `listL` will contain integers based on the user input. 
Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `listL` contains integers based on user input**
