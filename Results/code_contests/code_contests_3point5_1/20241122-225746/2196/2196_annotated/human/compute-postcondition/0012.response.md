Output State: 
- If `N` is greater than 0, `sum` will be updated by subtracting `maxL` from its current value.
- If `N` is 0 or lower, `sum` will remain the same as the sum of all elements in `listL` without subtracting `maxL`.
- `N` is at least 1, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` is either updated by subtracting `maxL` or remains the sum of all elements in `listL`.
Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` is either updated by subtracting `maxL` or remains the sum of all elements in `listL`.**
