According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` is the sum of all elements in `listL` plus the element at index `i`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`N` is at least 2, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, `sum` is the sum of all elements in `listL` plus the element at index `i+1`**
