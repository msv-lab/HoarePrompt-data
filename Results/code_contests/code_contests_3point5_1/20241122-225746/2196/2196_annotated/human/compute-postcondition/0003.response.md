The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. The variables `N`, `listL` containing integers based on user input, and `maxL` holding the maximum value from the input list are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input integer, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `listL` contains integers based on user input, `maxL` holds the maximum value from the input list, and `sum` is initialized to 0**
