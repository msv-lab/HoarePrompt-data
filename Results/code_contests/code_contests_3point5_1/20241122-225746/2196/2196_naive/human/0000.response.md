Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the sum of all sides of the polygon except for the longest side. It then compares the longest side to the sum of the other sides, following the theorem provided in the problem description. The logic implemented in the program is in line with the problem requirements and constraints. Additionally, the program handles the input of N-sided polygon with sides of length L_1, L_2, ..., L_N as specified. Overall, the program is correct as it outputs 'Yes' if the N-sided polygon can be drawn and 'No' otherwise, based on the given conditions.
