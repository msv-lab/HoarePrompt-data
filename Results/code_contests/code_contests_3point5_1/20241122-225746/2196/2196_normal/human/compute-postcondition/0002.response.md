Example Answer:
The maxL variable is assigned the maximum value from the list listL by using the max() function. The listL contains integers inputted by the user. Since N is between 3 and 10, the listL will have at least 3 elements. Therefore, the maxL variable will hold the maximum value from the listL. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list containing integers inputted by the user, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL**
