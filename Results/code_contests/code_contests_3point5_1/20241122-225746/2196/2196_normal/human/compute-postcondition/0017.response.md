Postcondition: ***sum is decreased by maxL, the loop executes at least once if N is at least 3. If N is less than 3, the loop does not execute, and sum remains 0. maxL stores the maximum value from listL. If sum is greater than maxL, 'Yes' is printed. If maxL is greater than or equal to sum, 'No' is printed.***
