According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list containing integers inputted by the user, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is the sum of listL elements up to index i+1 where i is 2, and `i` is 2.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3, as the loop iterates based on the range of `N`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list containing integers inputted by the user, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is the sum of listL elements up to index i+1 where i is 2, `i` is 3**
