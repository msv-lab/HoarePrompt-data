According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list containing integers inputted by the user, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is the sum of listL elements up to index i+1, `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list containing integers inputted by the user, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is the sum of listL elements up to index i+1, `i` is 2**
