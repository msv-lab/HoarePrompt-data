Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is constrained to be between 3 and 10, the value of `N` will be within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10**
