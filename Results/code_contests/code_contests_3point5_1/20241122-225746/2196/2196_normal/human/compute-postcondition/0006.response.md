According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list containing integers inputted by the user, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is the sum of listL elements up to index i, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list containing integers inputted by the user, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is the sum of listL elements up to index i, `i` is 1**
