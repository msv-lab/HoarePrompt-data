According to the code, the loop will execute for N iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the initial states need to be modified as follows:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `listL` is a list containing integers inputted by the user, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
