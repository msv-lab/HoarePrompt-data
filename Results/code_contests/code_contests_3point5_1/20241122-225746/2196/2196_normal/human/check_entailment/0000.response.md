Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `listL`, which aligns with the problem description.
- It calculates the sum of all elements in `listL` except for the maximum value `maxL`, which is in line with the theorem provided in the problem description.
- If the maximum value is less than the sum, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No', which again matches the expected output based on the problem description.
- The constraints provided in the problem description are also being followed in the code.
- The code covers all potential cases for determining if an N-sided polygon can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane based on the given conditions.
