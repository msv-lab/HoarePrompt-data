Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for N and the list of side lengths.
2. It correctly calculates the maximum side length and the sum of all side lengths except the maximum.
3. It then compares if the maximum side length is strictly less than the sum of the other side lengths, which follows the theorem provided in the problem description.
4. Based on the comparison, it prints 'Yes' or 'No' as required.
5. The program logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases and edge cases within the specified constraints.
6. The program is correct as it handles the problem scenario as described.
