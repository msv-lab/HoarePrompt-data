Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code seems to be attempting to solve the problem described in the input but it does not appear to be handling all cases correctly. The output hints further confirm this by mentioning calculations that the code does not seem to be performing accurately. The presence of two for loops without a clear connection to the described process indicates that the code might be missing some essential logic. The code needs to be revised to accurately implement the described process in order to be considered correct.
