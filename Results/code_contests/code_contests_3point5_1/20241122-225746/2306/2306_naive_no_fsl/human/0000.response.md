Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly implement the process described in the problem statement. The program is calculating the value of `res` in a different way than the specified process.

The provided pseudocode describes a process where the value of `res` is incremented each time a character in the string is processed. The loop should break when a point is reached where the sum of all characters processed so far becomes negative. However, the Python program is not following this process correctly.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the program is incorrect.
