Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the process described in the problem description. The calculation of the result 'res' is not accurate. The logic used in the program is different from the pseudocode provided in the problem description.

In the given program, the calculation of 'res' seems to be based on the number of changes in the prefix array and the number of times the condition `mn + imp[i][0] >= 0` is met. This approach is not equivalent to the process described in the problem.

To demonstrate the incorrectness of the program, consider the test case:
Input
```
1
+-
```
Expected Output
```
3
```
For the input string "+-", the correct value of 'res' after the process ends should be 3 as per the pseudocode. However, the provided program will give a different output for this case.
