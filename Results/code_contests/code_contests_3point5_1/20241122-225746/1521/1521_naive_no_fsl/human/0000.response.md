Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly calculates the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hands of an analog clock based on the input values of A, B, H, and M. It uses the formula provided in the problem description to calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands, and then calculates the distance between the two endpoints using the Euclidean distance formula.

The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description and correctly computes the distance between the endpoints. The logic is sound and there are no edge cases identified where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
