`sys.stdout` is reassigned to a `BytesIO` object. This means that the standard output stream is now redirected to the `BytesIO` object. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`sys.stdin` is assigned the standard input stream, `sys.stdout` is reassigned to a `BytesIO` object**.
