Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned the value of the radians of `h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5`. The values of `h` and `m` are based on user input, so the final value of `t1` will depend on those inputs. No other variables are affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t1` is assigned the calculated value based on `h` and `m`**
