Example Answer: 
A function `register` is called with a lambda function as an argument that writes the output stream to the standard output. The lambda function accesses `sys.stdout.getvalue()` to get the output stream and reassigns it to `os.write(1, ...)` to write the output. The state of `sys.stdin` remains as the standard input stream, and `sys.stdout` is now reassigned to a `BytesIO` object. Therefore, the Output State is: `sys.stdin` is assigned the standard input stream, `sys.stdout` is reassigned to a `BytesIO` object.
Output State: **`sys.stdin` is assigned the standard input stream, `sys.stdout` is reassigned to a `BytesIO` object**
