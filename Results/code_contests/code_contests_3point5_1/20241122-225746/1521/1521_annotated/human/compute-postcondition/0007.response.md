Example Answer:
`t2` is assigned the value of `radians(m % 60 * 6)`, where `m` is the input from the user. The value of `m` can be any integer, so the result of `m % 60 * 6` will vary. The result will then be converted to radians. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t1` is assigned the calculated value based on `h` and `m`, `t2` is assigned the calculated value based on the user input `m` converted to radians.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t1` is assigned the calculated value based on `h` and `m`, `t2` is assigned the calculated value based on the user input `m` converted to radians**
