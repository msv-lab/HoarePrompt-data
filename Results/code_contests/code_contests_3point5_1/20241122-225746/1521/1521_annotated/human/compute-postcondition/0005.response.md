Example Answer:
The values of `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned based on the input provided by the user after splitting the input by spaces and converting each part to an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` will depend on the input given by the user. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned integer values based on user input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned integer values based on user input**
