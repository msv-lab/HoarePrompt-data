Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hour and minute hands of an analog clock based on the input values of the length of the hour hand (A), the length of the minute hand (B), the hour (H), and the minutes (M). The program calculates the angles of rotation for the hour and minute hands, then uses trigonometric functions to determine the coordinates of the endpoints of the hands. Finally, it calculates the Euclidean distance between the two endpoints and prints the result. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
