Example Answer:
The value of `m` is taken modulo 60 and multiplied by 6, then converted to radians. The previous values of `m` are obtained from user input. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input; `t1` is assigned the calculated value in radians; `t2` is assigned the calculated value in radians.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input; `t1` is assigned the calculated value in radians; `t2` is assigned the calculated value in radians**
