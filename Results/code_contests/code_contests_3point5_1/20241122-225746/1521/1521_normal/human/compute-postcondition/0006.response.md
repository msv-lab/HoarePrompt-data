Example Answer: 
`t1` is assigned the value of `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`. The values of `h` and `m` are obtained from user input, so their specific values are unknown. However, `h` is restricted to be within 0-23 and `m` is within 0-59. Therefore, the calculation `h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5` will be within a valid range. The `radians()` function converts the angle to radians. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input; `t1` is assigned the calculated value in radians.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input; `t1` is assigned the calculated value in radians**.
