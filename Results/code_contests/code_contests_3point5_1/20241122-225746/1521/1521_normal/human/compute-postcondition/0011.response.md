Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input; `t1`, `t2` are assigned the calculated value in radians; `x1` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `t1`; `y1` is the result of `a` multiplied by the cosine of `-t1`; `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`; `y2` is assigned the value of `b` multiplied by the cosine of `-t2`.**
