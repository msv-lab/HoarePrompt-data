Example Answer:
The code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points represented by `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` in a 2D plane. The distance formula is applied to the coordinates, which are calculated based on the input values of `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2`. The final result is the square root of the sum of the squared differences of x and y coordinates. 
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input; `t1`, `t2` are assigned the calculated value in radians; `x1` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `t1`; `y1` is the result of `a` multiplied by the cosine of `-t1`; `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`; `y2` is assigned the value of `b` multiplied by the cosine of `-t2`. The calculated Euclidean distance is printed.**
