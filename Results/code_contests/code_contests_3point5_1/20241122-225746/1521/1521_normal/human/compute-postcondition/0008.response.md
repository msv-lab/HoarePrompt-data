Example Answer:
The value of `x1` is calculated as -a * sin(-t1), where `a`, `t1` are obtained from user input, and `sin` is the sine function in radians. After the calculation, the value of `x1` is determined based on the input values of `a` and `t1`. 
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input; `t1`, `t2` are assigned the calculated value in radians; `x1` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `t1`**
