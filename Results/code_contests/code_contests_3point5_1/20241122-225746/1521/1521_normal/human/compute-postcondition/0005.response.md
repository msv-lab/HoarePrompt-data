Example Answer:
`a, b, h, m` are assigned values by unpacking the input after converting them to integers. The values are obtained from the input using `input().split()`. The variables `a, b, h, m` will hold the respective integer values entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input**
