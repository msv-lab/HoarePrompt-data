Example Answer: 
The `register` function is called with a lambda function that writes the value of `sys.stdout` to standard output. This lambda function essentially redirects the standard output to a BytesIO object. The `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())` statement will write the value of `sys.stdout` to standard output. The redirection of standard output to BytesIO object remains in effect. Therefore, the Output State is: `sys.stdin` is set to read input bytes from standard input, `sys.stdout` is redirected to a BytesIO object.
Output State: **`sys.stdin` is set to read input bytes from standard input, `sys.stdout` is redirected to a BytesIO object**
