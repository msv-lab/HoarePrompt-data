Example Answer:
`y1` is assigned the value of `a` multiplied by the cosine of `-t1`. The value of `a` is obtained from user input, and the value of `t1` is calculated in radians. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `m` are assigned integer values obtained from user input; `t1`, `t2` are assigned the calculated value in radians; `x1` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `t1`; `y1` is the result of `a` multiplied by the cosine of `-t1`.
