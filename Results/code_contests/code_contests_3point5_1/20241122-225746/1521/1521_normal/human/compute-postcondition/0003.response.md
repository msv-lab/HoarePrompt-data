Example Answer:
The `input` function is redefined using a lambda function where `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')` is set to read input bytes from standard input. This redefinition affects the behavior of the `input` function throughout the program. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `sys.stdin` is set to read input bytes from standard input, `sys.stdout` is redirected to a BytesIO object.
Output State: **`sys.stdin` is set to read input bytes from standard input, `sys.stdout` is redirected to a BytesIO object**
