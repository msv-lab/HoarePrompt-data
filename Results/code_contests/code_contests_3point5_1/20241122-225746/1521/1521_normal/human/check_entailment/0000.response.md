Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly calculate the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hour and minute hands of an analog clock. The calculations seem to be incorrect based on the problem description. 

For example, if we input A=3, B=4, H=0, M=0, the expected output should be 5.0 as at 0 o'clock, the two hands overlap each other. However, when we run the code with these inputs, the output is not 5.0.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
