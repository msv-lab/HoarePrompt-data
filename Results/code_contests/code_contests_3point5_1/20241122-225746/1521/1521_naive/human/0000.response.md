Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hour and minute hands on an analog clock based on the input values of A, B, H, and M. The program uses trigonometric calculations to determine the positions of the hour and minute hands at the specified time and then calculates the distance between the endpoints accurately. Since the program follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all potential cases, it can be considered correct.
