Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes as input. It calculates the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes and then constructs the network accordingly by connecting nodes with wires. The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the expected output for all possible cases within the given constraints. Since the program works correctly for all potential cases, we can conclude that the correctness is True.
