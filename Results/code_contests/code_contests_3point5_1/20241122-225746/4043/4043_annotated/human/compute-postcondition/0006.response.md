Example Answer:
`i` is printed along with `i + 1`, and `i` is further incremented by 1. The previous values of `i`, `startIndex`, and `branchLength` are unknown. The output state after execution is: `startIndex` is further incremented by 1, `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly to satisfy `i` < `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and the values of `i` and `i + 1` are printed.
Output State: **`startIndex` is further incremented by 1, `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly to satisfy `i` < `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, `i` and `i + 1` are printed**
