Output State: **`startIndex` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly to satisfy `i` < `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, print statement prints the current value of `startIndex` and `startIndex + 1`. If `startIndex + branchLength - 1` exceeds `n`, the loop does not execute.**
