Example Answer:
The code prints the formatted string where `{0}` is replaced by `1` and `{1}` is replaced by the value of `startIndex`. Since there is no assignment or change in the initial state, the output state is: n and k are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1**
