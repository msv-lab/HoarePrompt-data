Since the loop iterates over the range from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, the loop will execute again if `startIndex + branchLength - 1` is less than the upper limit of the range. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `startIndex` needs to be incremented by 1, and `branchLength` needs to be adjusted such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1` is less than the upper limit.
State: **Adjust `startIndex` by incrementing it by 1 and adjust `branchLength` accordingly to satisfy the loop condition**
