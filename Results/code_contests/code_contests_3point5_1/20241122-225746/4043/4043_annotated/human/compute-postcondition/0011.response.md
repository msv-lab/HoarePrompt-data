Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `startIndex` and `branchLength`. It prints a sequence of pairs of numbers starting from 1 and `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. If the loop is executed, it returns the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`. The function does not handle cases where the loop is not executed due to constraints on `startIndex` and `branchLength`.**
