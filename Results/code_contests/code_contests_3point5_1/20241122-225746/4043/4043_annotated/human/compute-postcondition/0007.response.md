According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `startIndex`, `branchLength`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `startIndex` is further incremented by 1, `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly to satisfy `i` < `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`startIndex` is further incremented by 1, `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly to satisfy `i` < `startIndex + branchLength`, `i` and `i + 1` are printed**
