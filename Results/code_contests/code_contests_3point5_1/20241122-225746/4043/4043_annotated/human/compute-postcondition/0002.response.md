Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the values of `i` and `i + 1` formatted as a string. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `i`, `startIndex`, or `branchLength`. Therefore, the output state is unknown and depends on the actual values of these variables during runtime.
Output State: **Unknown**
