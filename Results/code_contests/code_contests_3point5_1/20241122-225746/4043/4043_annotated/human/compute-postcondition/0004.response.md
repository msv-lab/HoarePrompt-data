Example Answer:
`i` is incremented by 1 in the print statement, so the output will be the current value of `i` and the value of `i` incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is unknown, but after incrementing `startIndex` by 1, the value of `i` will be `startIndex + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `startIndex` is incremented by 1, `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly, and the print statement prints the current value of `startIndex` and `startIndex + 1`.
Output State: **`startIndex` is incremented by 1, `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly, print statement prints the current value of `startIndex` and `startIndex + 1`**
