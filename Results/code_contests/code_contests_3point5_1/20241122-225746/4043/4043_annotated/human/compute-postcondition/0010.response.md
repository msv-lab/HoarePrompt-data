The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `startIndex` and `branchLength`, both of which are integers. The constraints are that `startIndex` and `branchLength` are integers, and 3 ≤ `startIndex` ≤ 2·10^5, and 2 ≤ `branchLength` ≤ `startIndex` - 1. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `startIndex + branchLength`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `startIndex` and `branchLength`, and return the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`.
