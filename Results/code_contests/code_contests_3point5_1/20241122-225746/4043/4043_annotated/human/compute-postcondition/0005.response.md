According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `startIndex` is incremented by 1, and `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly. So for the loop to execute one more time, `startIndex` needs to be adjusted by incrementing it by 1 and `branchLength` should be adjusted accordingly to maintain the condition `i` < `startIndex + branchLength - 1`.
State: **`startIndex` is further incremented by 1, `branchLength` is adjusted accordingly to satisfy `i` < `startIndex + branchLength - 1`**
