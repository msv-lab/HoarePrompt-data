Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function that generates a network of nodes with minimum possible number of wires while ensuring that exactly k nodes are exit-nodes. The function takes two parameters: `startIndex` and `branchLength`, which determine the connections between nodes in the network. The function iterates through the nodes and prints the connections between them based on the constraints provided in the problem description.

The code logic aligns with the problem description by ensuring that there are exactly k exit-nodes and that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is minimized. The code also satisfies the constraints of the input size specified in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided description and the code logic, the correctness of the code is **True**.
