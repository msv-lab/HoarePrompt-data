Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes and then constructs the network accordingly by connecting nodes with wires.

The program handles cases where the number of nodes and exit-nodes satisfy the constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) and ensures that each exit-node is connected to exactly one other node, while all other nodes are connected to at least two nodes to increase system stability.

The program iterates through the nodes and connects them with wires based on the calculated minimum length and remaining nodes. It constructs the network in a way that minimizes the maximum distance between two exit-nodes.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides a valid solution without any issues.
