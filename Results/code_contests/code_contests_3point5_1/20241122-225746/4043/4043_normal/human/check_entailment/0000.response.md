Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input values for the total number of nodes `n` and the number of exit-nodes `k`.
- It calculates the minimum length of each branch using the formula `(n - 1) // k` and stores the remainder in `r`.
- It calculates the maximum distance between the two most distant exit-nodes using the formula `minLength * 2 + (2 if r >= 2 else r)`.
- The function `func_1` is defined to print pairs of values for connected nodes based on the given branch length.
- The code then iterates to create the network connections by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
- Finally, it prints the maximum distance and the connections between nodes.
- The code seems to correctly follow the problem description as it constructs a network with the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes by connecting nodes appropriately. The output matches the expected output format and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
