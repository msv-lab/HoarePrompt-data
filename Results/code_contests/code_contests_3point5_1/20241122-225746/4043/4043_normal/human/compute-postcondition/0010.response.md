The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `startIndex` and `branchLength`. The constraints for these parameters are that both `startIndex` and `branchLength` are integers such that 3 <= `startIndex` <= 2*10^5 and 2 <= `branchLength` <= `startIndex` - 1. After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `startIndex` and `branchLength`, and return the sum of these two values.
