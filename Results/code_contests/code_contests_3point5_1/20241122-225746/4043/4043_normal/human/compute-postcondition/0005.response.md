According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `startIndex` is `startIndex + 1`, `branchLength` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `startIndex` needs to be adjusted to `startIndex + 1`, and `branchLength` needs to be adjusted to at least 3.
State: **`startIndex` is `startIndex + 1`, `branchLength` is at least 3**
