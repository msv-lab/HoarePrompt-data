According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `startIndex` and `branchLength`. If `startIndex` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `startIndex` is `startIndex + 1`, and `branchLength` is at least 3. So for the loop to execute one more time, `startIndex` should be less than `startIndex + 1 + branchLength - 1`, which simplifies to `startIndex` is less than `startIndex + branchLength`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`startIndex` is `startIndex + 1`, `branchLength` is at least 3**
