Example Answer: 
The code prints the values of `i` and `i + 1` formatted as a string. The values of `i` and `i + 1` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the initial state where `startIndex` is `startIndex + 1`, we can infer that `i` is `startIndex` and `i + 1` is `startIndex + 1`. Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of the values of `startIndex` and `startIndex + 1`.
Output State: **`startIndex` is `startIndex + 1`, `branchLength` is at least 3; prints the values of `startIndex` and `startIndex + 1` concatenated as a string.**
