Example Answer:
The code prints the values of `i` and `i + 1` using the `format` method. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, so the output state will be unknown. The only known information is that the `startIndex` is defined and `branchLength` is at least 2.
Output State: **unknown, `startIndex` is defined, `branchLength` is at least 2**
