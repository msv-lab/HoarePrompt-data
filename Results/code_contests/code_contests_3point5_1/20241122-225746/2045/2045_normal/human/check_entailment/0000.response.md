Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description. It seems to be calculating the sum of absolute differences from the median of the list, which is not the same as determining the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level in the game "Arranging The Sheep". The code is not handling the game scenario described in the problem.

The output hints do not align with the code either. The code is not calculating the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level, as described in the problem.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
