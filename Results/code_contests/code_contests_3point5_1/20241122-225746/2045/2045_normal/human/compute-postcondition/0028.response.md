Example Answer:
A new value is appended to the list `af` which is the sum of absolute differences between each element `k` in list `l` and the median `med`. Since no information is provided about the initial values of `af`, `l`, and `med`, the output state will be `An error occurs when trying to pop from an empty list`.
Output State: **An error occurs when trying to pop from an empty list**
