Example Answer:
The code tries to get the element at the middle index of list `l` by calculating `len(l) // 2`. However, if `l` is empty, this will result in an error when trying to access an index of an empty list. Therefore, an error occurs when trying to pop from an empty list.
Output State: **An error occurs when trying to pop from an empty list**
