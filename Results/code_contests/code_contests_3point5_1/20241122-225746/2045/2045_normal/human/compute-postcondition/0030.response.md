Postcondition: ***`l` is a list. If `l` is not empty, the median of `l` is calculated and stored in `med`, then the absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med` are summed up and appended to `af`. If `l` is empty, 0 is appended to `af`. In both cases, the program does not encounter an error while handling the list `l`.***
