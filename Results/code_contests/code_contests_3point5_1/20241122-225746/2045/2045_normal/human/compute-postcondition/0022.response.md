According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `le`. If `le` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `le` is popped to get the range value, `l` is a list, and `af` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. To execute the loop one more time, `le` should still not be empty. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `le` should not be empty.
State: **`l` is a list. If `l` is not empty, the median `med` of `l` is calculated, and the absolute differences of each element in `l` from `med` are summed and appended to list `af`. Otherwise, if `l` is empty, 0 is appended to list `af`. In both cases, `le` is not used before assignment. `le` is not empty**
