Example Answer: 
The code calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in list `l` and the variable `med`, which is used before assignment. Therefore, the code will raise an error due to the variable `med` being used before being assigned a value. The state remains the same.
Output State: **Error: `med` is used before assignment**
