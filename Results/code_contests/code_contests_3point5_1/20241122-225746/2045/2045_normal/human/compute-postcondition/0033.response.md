Example Answer:
If `l` is not empty, the median `med` of `l` is calculated, and the absolute differences of each element in `l` from `med` are summed and appended to list `af`. If `l` is empty, 0 is appended to list `af`. In both cases, the program does not encounter an error while handling the list `l`. If `le` is empty or does not contain enough elements to pop, the loop will not execute. The code then prints each element of `af` on a new line.
Output State: **`l` is a list, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences for each element in `l` from the median, and the elements of `af` are printed on separate lines**
