Example Answer:
A list comprehension is used to iterate over the range of `n` and filter elements from `le` that are equal to '*'. However, the variable `le` is being used before it has been defined in the initial state. This code will result in an error because `le` is not initialized or defined. Therefore, the output state will be an error due to `le` being used before assignment.
Output State: **Error: `le` is used before assignment**
