Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values from the standard input and processes them to calculate the sum of absolute differences from the median of a list. It iterates through the input values to extract necessary information for the calculation. If the list is empty, it appends 0 to the result list. The function then prints the calculated sum of absolute differences. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input values provided during execution.**
