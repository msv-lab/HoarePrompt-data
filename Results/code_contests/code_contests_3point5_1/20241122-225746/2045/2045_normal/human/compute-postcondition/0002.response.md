According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `le` list. If the list `le` has at least 1 element that can be popped, the loop can execute. The variable `zorg` is in the range of the popped integer value. Before the loop starts, `af` being an empty list means the loop can execute. So, for the loop to execute, `le` must have at least 1 element, and `zorg` is within the range of the popped integer value, and `af` remains an empty list.
State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` has at least 1 element to pop, `zorg` is within the range of the popped integer value**
