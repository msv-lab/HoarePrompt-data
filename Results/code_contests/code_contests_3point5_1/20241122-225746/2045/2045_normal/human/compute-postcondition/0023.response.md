Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value popped from `le`, which is an integer conversion of the popped value. The list `le` is modified by removing the last element. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list, `af` is a list, `le` is empty, and `n` is an integer value popped from `le`.
Output State: **`l` is a list, `af` is a list, `le` is empty, `n` is an integer value popped from `le`**
