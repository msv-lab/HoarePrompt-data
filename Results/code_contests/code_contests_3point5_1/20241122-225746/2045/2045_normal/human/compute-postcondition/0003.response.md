Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is assigned the value of the integer popped from the list `le`. Since `le` has at least 1 element to pop, `n` will be assigned that value. The range of the popped integer value is within the range of `zorg`. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is an empty list, `le` is now empty, `zorg` is within the range of the popped integer value, and `n` is assigned the popped integer value.
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` is now empty, `zorg` is within the range of the popped integer value, and `n` is assigned the popped integer value**
