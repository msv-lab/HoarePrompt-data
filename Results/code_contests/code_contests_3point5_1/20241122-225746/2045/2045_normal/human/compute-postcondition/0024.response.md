Example Answer:
The value of `n` is popped from the empty list `le`, which will result in an error since there are no elements to pop in an empty list. The states of the other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`l` is a list, `af` is a list, `le` is empty, and an error occurs when trying to pop from an empty list**
