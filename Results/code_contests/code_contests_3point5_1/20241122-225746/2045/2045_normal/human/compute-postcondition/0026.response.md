Example Answer:
The list comprehension calculates the difference between each element and its index in the list `l`. However, since `l` is empty, an error will occur when trying to pop from an empty list. Therefore, the program will not successfully execute this code.
Output State: **An error occurs when trying to pop from an empty list**
