Postcondition: ***`l` is a list. If `l` is not empty, the median `med` of `l` is calculated, and the absolute differences of each element in `l` from `med` are summed and appended to list `af`. Otherwise, if `l` is empty, 0 is appended to list `af`. In both cases, `le` is not used before assignment.***
