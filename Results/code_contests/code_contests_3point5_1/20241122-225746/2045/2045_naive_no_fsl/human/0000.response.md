Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level for each test case. It first reads the input, then iterates through each test case to calculate the positions of the sheep, calculates the median position, and then calculates the sum of distances between each sheep and the median position. Finally, it outputs the result for each test case. The logic follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
