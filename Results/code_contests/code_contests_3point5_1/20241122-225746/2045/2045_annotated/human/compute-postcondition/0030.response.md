Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `le` has at least 1 valid integer value left, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences with the updated values and 0 appended at the end if `l` was empty, `zorg` is 1, `n` is the new integer value popped from `le`, `l` is the updated list with absolute differences, `med` is the middle element of list `l`. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the new middle element of list `l` and `af` now contains the sum of absolute differences between `med` and each element in `l`. If `l` is empty, `af` contains 0 appended at the end, and `l` is updated with the popped value from `le`.***
