According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value obtained by popping the last element of the list `le`. If the popped value is a valid integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` being a positive integer ensures that the loop can execute. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `zorg` needs to be set to 0, `le` should have at least 1 valid integer value popped, and `af` should remain empty.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `le` has at least 1 valid integer value popped, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is 0**
