Example Answer:
The sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in list `l` and the middle element `med` is calculated and appended to list `af`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `t` is a positive integer, `le` has at least 1 valid integer value popped, `af` was initially empty but now contains the sum of absolute differences, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value popped from `le`, `l` is a non-empty list, and `med` is the middle element of list `l`. 
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `le` has at least 1 valid integer value popped, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value popped from `le`, `l` is a non-empty list, `med` is the middle element of list `l`**
