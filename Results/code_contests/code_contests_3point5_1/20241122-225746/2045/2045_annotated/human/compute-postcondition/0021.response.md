Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `le` has at least 1 valid integer value popped, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences with the updated values, `zorg` is 1, `n` is the new integer value popped from `le`, `l` is the updated list with absolute differences. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the new middle element of list `l` calculated as `l[len(l) // 2]`, and `af` now contains the sum of absolute differences between `med` and each element in `l`. If `l` is empty, `af` contains 0 appended at the end.***
