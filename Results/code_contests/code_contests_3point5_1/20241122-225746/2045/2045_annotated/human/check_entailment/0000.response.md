Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case as described in the problem, and calculates the minimum number of moves required to complete the level. It correctly handles cases where there are sheep at different positions in the line and calculates the sum of absolute differences between each sheep's position and the middle position to determine the minimum moves needed. The output is also formatted correctly. Overall, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description.
