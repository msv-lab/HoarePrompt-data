Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of shuffling operations needed to move the marble from position s to position t. It calculates the sum of all the shuffling operation parameters and then subtracts the sum of the initial positions of the glasses. This difference represents the number of shuffling operations needed to move the marble to the final position. The program works correctly for all the given examples and follows the problem description accurately.
