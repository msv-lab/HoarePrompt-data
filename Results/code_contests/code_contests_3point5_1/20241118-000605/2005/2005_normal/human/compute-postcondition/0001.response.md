Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input from the lambda function `IN()` which maps the input values to integers. The code calculates the sum of the first input values and subtracts it from the sum of the second input values. The result is then negated and printed. Since the initial state does not specify any initial input values, we cannot determine the exact output values. Therefore, the Output State is: IN = lambda : map(int, raw_input().split()) and the result of the print statement is unknown.
Output State: **IN = lambda : map(int, raw_input().split())**
