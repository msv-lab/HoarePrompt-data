Correctness: **False**

The given code does not actually solve the problem described in the prompt. It calculates the difference between the sum of two lists of integers and then prints the negative of this difference. This has no relation to the problem of moving a marble from one glass to another based on shuffling operations. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for any potential case.
