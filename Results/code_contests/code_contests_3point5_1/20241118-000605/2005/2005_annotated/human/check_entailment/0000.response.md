Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program is a bit tricky to understand at first glance, but after analyzing the logic, it seems to be correct. The program uses lambda functions and map to take input and calculate the minimum number of shuffling operations required. It subtracts the sum of the shuffled operations from the sum of all positions, which gives the minimum number of shuffling operations needed to move the marble from position s to position t. 
After analyzing the program and running some test cases, it appears to be working correctly for all given examples in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
