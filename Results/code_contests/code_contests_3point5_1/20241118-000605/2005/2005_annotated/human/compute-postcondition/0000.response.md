Example Answer:
The lambda function `IN` takes input from the user, splits it, and maps the values to integers. The variables `n`, `s`, `t`, `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` are not initialized or assigned any values explicitly in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: **No variables are initialized or affected by this code snippet**.
Output State: **No variables are initialized or affected by this code snippet**
