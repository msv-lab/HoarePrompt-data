Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the depth of the snow cover as described in the problem. The formula used in the program is incorrect and does not yield the correct result for all potential cases. For example, for the input (8, 13), the program will output 10 instead of the correct answer of 2. This inconsistency shows that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
