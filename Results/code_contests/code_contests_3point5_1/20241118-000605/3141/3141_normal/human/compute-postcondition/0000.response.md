Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `a` and `b` are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500**
