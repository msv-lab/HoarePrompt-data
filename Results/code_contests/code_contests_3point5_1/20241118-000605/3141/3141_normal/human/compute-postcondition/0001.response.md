Example Answer:
The code calculates a mathematical expression based on the values of `a` and `b`. It first calculates `b - a`, then multiplies it by `b - a - 1`, and finally divides the result by 2 and subtracts `a` from it. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500, we know that the values of `a` and `b` fall within this range. Therefore, the output state will be based on the result of the mathematical expression with the given values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **output state**
