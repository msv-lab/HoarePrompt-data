Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input, calculates the sum of all integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive), and prints the result. **

Note: The annotations mention that the function does not accept any parameters, but in reality, it reads input from the user. Also, the calculation logic seems incorrect as it may not calculate the sum as intended.
