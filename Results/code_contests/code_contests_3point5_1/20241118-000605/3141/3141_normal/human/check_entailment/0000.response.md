Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly calculate the depth of the snow cover as per the problem description. The code is supposed to take two integers `a` and `b` as input, which represent the lengths of the parts of two adjacent towers that are not covered with snow. It then calculates the depth of the snow cover based on the difference between the two tower lengths.

However, the code implementation itself is incorrect. The expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` is not equivalent to calculating the depth of the snow cover. The formula used in the code does not align with the problem description provided.

Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
