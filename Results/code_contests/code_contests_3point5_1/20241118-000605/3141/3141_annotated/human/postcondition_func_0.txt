The function reads two integers 'a' and 'b' from the user input, then calculates a mathematical expression that involves these integers. The expression computes the sum of integers between 'a' and 'b', where 'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500. However, there is a missing functionality in the code as the result of the expression is calculated incorrectly due to a misplaced parenthesis. The correct calculation should be ((b - a) * (b - a - 1)) / 2 - a.
