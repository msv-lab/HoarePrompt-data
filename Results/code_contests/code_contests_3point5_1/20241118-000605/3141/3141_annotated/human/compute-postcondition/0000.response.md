Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it, `int` converts the input values to integers, and `map` applies the function to each element of the input. The values of `a` and `b` are now determined by the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers based on user input.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers based on user input**
