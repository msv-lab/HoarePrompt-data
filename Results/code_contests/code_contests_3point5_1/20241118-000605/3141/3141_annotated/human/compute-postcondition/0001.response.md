Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`. The values of `a` and `b` are based on user input, so the specific values are unknown. After running the code, the output state will be the same as the initial state with the result of the expression.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers based on user input, result of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`**
