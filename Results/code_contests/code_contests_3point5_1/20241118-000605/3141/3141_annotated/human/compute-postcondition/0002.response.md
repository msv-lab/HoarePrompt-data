The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of all integers between a and b (inclusive) and returns the result. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the sum of integers between a and b, where a and b are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= a < b < 499500.
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of integers between a and b, where a and b are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500.**
