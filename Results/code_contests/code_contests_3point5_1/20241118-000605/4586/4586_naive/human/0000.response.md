Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the problem description. It first reads the first and second layout strings along with the text typed in the first layout. Then, it creates a dictionary mapping each character from the first layout to its index. After that, it iterates through the input text and constructs the modified text based on the mappings from the first layout to the second layout. The program handles uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits correctly and produces the desired output. 

There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected, so the correctness is true.
