Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes in two layouts and a string typed in the first layout. It then creates a dictionary mapping characters from the first layout to integers. It iterates through the characters of the string, checking if it's a digit, uppercase letter, or neither, and modifies the `Mods` string accordingly by mapping the characters to the second layout based on the dictionary created. The code correctly handles digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters according to the problem description. It seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the expected output. The output hints also align with the code's logic, confirming its correctness.
