Functionality: **The function `func` reads user input for `layout1`, `layout2`, and `s`. It then creates a dictionary `dic` mapping characters from `layout1` to integers from 0 to 25. The function iterates through the characters of `s`, updating `Mods` based on certain conditions. If a character is a digit, it is appended to `Mods`. If it is an uppercase letter, the corresponding uppercase letter from `layout2` based on the mapping in `dic` is appended in uppercase. If it is neither a digit nor an uppercase letter, the corresponding character from `layout2` based on the mapping in `dic` is appended. Finally, the modified `Mods` string is printed. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, relying on the user to provide input.**
