Postcondition: ***`layout1` and `layout2` are assigned the values of the user's input. `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i` of string `s` according to the given conditions, where `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is appended with the uppercase version of the character corresponding to the mapping of `s[i]` in `layout2` based on the dictionary `dic`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not an uppercase letter, `Mods` is appended with the character corresponding to the mapping of `s[i]` in `layout2`. The mappings are determined by the dictionary `dic`, which contains mappings of characters from `layout1` to integers from 0 to 25. Ensure that the postcondition includes all possible cases, covering scenarios when the character at index `i` of `s` is an uppercase letter, a digit, or neither an uppercase letter nor a digit.***
