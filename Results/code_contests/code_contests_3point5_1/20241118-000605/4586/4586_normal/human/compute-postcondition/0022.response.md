Postcondition: ***`layout1` and `layout2` are assigned the values of the user's input. `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i` of string `s`. If the character is a digit, `Mods` is appended with that digit. If the character is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is appended with the uppercase version of the character corresponding to the mapping of `s[i]` in `layout2` based on the dictionary `dic`. If the character is neither a digit nor an uppercase letter, `Mods` is appended with the character corresponding to the mapping of `s[i]` in `layout2`. `dic` contains mappings of characters from `layout1` to integers from 0 to 25. `i` is 0, `s` has a length of at least 1, `layout1` has a length of at least 26 characters.***
