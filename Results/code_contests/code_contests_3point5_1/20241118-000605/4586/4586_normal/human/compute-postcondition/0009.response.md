According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 26. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` needs to be less than 26.
State: **`layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input, `Mods` is an empty string, `dic` contains mappings of characters from `layout1` to integers from 0 to 25 with the addition of the character at index 26 in `layout1` mapped to 26, `i` is 25**
