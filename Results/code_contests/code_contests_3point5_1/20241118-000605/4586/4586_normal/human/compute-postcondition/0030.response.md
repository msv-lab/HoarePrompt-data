Example Answer:
`Mods` is updated by adding the character at index `i` of string `s`. The previous values of `layout1`, `layout2`, and `s` are unknown, so the output state is: `layout1` and `layout2` are assigned the values of the user's input, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i+1` of string `s`.
Output State: **`layout1` and `layout2` are assigned the values of the user's input, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i+1` of string `s`**
