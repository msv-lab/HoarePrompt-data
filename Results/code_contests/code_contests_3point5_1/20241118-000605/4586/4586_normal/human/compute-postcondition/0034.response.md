Postcondition: ***`layout1` and `layout2` are assigned the values of the user's input. `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i+1` of string `s`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is a digit, `Mods` is updated by adding the character at index `i` of string `s`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by adding the corresponding uppercase character from `layout2` based on the lowercase character at index `i` using the dictionary `dic`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not uppercase, `Mods` is updated by adding the corresponding character from `layout2` based on the character at index `i` using the dictionary `dic`. This covers all scenarios where `s[i]` is a digit, uppercase, or not, ensuring the correct update of `Mods` in each case.***
