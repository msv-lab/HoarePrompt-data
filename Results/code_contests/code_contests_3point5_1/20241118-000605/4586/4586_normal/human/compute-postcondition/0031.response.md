Example Answer:
`Mods` is updated by appending the uppercase version of the character at index `dic[s[i].lower()]` of `layout2` to `Mods`. The values of `layout1` and `layout2` are not affected. 
Output State: **`layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is assigned the value of the user's input, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index `i+1` of string `s`**
