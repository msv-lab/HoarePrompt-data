Example Answer:
`Mods` is assigned an empty string ''. The values of `layout1` and `layout2` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input, `Mods` is an empty string.
Output State: **`layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input, `Mods` is an empty string**
