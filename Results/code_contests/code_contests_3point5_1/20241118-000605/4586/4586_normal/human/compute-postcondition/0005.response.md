According to the code, the loop will always execute as the range is from 0 to 25 (inclusive). Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that the loop can execute successfully. Since the loop will iterate 26 times, the adjustments are as follows:
State: **`layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input, `Mods` is an empty string, `dic` is initialized as an empty dictionary, `i` is 0 to 25**
