Example Answer: 
`layout2` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes user input. `layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, and `layout2` is assigned the value of the user's input as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input.
Output State: **`layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input**
