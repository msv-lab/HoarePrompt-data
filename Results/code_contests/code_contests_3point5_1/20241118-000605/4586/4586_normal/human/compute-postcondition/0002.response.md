Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts user input. The variables `layout1` and `layout2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input.
Output State: **`layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input**
