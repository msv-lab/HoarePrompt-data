According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 25. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 26. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`layout1` is assigned the value of the user's input, `layout2` is also assigned the value of the user's input, `Mods` is an empty string, `dic` contains mappings of characters from `layout1` to integers from 0 to 25 with the addition of the character at index 26 in `layout1` mapped to 26, `i` is 26, and `dic['layout1[i]']` is assigned the value 25**
