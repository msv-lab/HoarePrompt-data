Example Answer:
The character at index `i` in string `s` is added to the end of the `Mods` string. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the character is being added to `Mods` based on the value of `i`, the new state of `Mods` will depend on the specific character at the new index. The lengths of `layout1`, `layout2`, and `s` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`layout1` has exactly 26 characters, `layout2` can be of any length, `s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than the current value of `i`, `Mods` is updated based on the next character in `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
