Example Answer:
The value of `Mods` is updated by adding the character in `layout2` at the index specified by `dic[s[i]]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `Mods` and `i` is not provided, the output state will be: `layout1` has exactly 26 characters, `layout2` can be of any length, `s` is a non-empty string, `Mods` is updated based on the next character in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`layout1` has exactly 26 characters, `layout2` can be of any length, `s` is a non-empty string, `Mods` is updated based on the next character in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**
