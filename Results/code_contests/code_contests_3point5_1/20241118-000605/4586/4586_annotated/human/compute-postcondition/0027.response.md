Postcondition: ***`layout1` has exactly 26 characters, `layout2` can be of any length, `s` is a non-empty string, `Mods` is updated based on the next character in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` appends the corresponding transformed character from `layout2` using the dictionary `dic` and converts it to uppercase. If the character is not uppercase, `Mods` appends the corresponding transformed character from `layout2` using the dictionary `dic`. After the execution of the if else block, the variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, ensuring the proper handling of all cases including edge cases.***
