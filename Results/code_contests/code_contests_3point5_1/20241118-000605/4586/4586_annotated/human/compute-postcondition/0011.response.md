According to the code, the loop will execute for every value of `i` from 0 to 25 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 25. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`layout1` is a string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `s` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is an empty string, `dic` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs with the recent addition from `layout1` at index 26, and `i` is 26**
