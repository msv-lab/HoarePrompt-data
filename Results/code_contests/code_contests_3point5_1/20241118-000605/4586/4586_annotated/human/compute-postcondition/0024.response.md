Example Answer: 
`Mods` is updated with the next character in `s` at index `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `Mods` will have the next character in `s` appended to it. The lengths of `layout1` and `layout2` are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`layout1` has exactly 26 characters, `layout2` can be of any length, `s` is a non-empty string, `Mods` is updated based on the next character in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**
