Postcondition: ***`layout1` has exactly 26 characters, `layout2` can be of any length, `s` is a non-empty string, `Mods` is updated based on the next character in `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The if-else block handles all cases where if the character at index `i` in string `s` is a digit, `Mods` appends that digit. If the character is an uppercase letter, `Mods` appends the corresponding transformed uppercase character from `layout2` using the dictionary `dic`. If the character is not uppercase, `Mods` appends the corresponding transformed character from `layout2` using the dictionary `dic`. The variables retain their initial conditions and relationships, ensuring proper handling of all cases, including edge cases.***
