According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 26. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 26. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`layout1` is a string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `s` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is an empty string, `dic` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs, and `i` is 25**
