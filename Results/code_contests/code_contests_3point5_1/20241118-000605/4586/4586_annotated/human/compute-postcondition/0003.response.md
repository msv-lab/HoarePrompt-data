Example Answer: 
`Mods` is initialized as an empty string. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `layout1` is a string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `s` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is an empty string.
Output State: **`layout1` is a string based on user input, `layout2` is a string based on user input, `s` is a string based on user input, `Mods` is an empty string**
