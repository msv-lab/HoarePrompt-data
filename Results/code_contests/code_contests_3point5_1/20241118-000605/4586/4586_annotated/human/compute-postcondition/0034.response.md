Postcondition: ***`layout1` has exactly 26 characters, `layout2` can be of any length, `s` is a non-empty string with length greater than the updated value of `i`, `Mods` is updated based on the next character in `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is a digit, `Mods` is appended with that digit. If the character at index `i` in `s` is uppercase, `Mods` is appended with the corresponding uppercase character from `layout2` based on the lowercase version of the character. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not uppercase, `Mods` is appended with the corresponding character from `layout2` based on the character itself.***
