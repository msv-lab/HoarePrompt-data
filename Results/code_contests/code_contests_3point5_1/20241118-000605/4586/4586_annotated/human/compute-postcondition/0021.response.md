Postcondition: ***`layout1` has exactly 26 characters, `layout2` can be of any length, `s` is a non-empty string, `Mods` is a string. If `s[i]` is an uppercase character, `Mods` contains uppercase characters based on the mapping of characters from `s` to `layout2` using the `dic` dictionary. If `s[i]` is not an uppercase character, `Mods` contains characters from `layout2` based on the values retrieved from `dic` using characters from `s`. The `dic` dictionary contains entries for all characters in `layout1` with values from 0 to 25, and `i` ranges from 0 to 25. Additionally, `s[i]` is not a digit, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
