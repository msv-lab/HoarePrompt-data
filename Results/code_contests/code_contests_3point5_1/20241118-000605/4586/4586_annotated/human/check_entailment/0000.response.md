Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads in the first layout, second layout, and the text typed in the first layout.
2. It then creates a dictionary mapping characters from the first layout to integers from 0 to 25.
3. The program then iterates through the input text and modifies it based on the mappings from the first layout to the second layout using the created dictionary.
4. It handles digits and uppercase letters correctly by checking and modifying accordingly.
5. Finally, it prints the modified text as required.

The program logic follows the problem description for all potential cases, and there are no apparent issues with the implementation.
