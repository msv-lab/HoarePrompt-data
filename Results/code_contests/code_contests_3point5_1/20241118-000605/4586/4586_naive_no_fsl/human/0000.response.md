Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes in the two keyboard layouts and the text typed in the first layout as input.
2. It then creates a dictionary mapping each letter in the first layout to its index.
3. It iterates through the input text, checking if the character is a digit, uppercase letter, or lowercase letter.
4. It then uses the dictionary to find the corresponding letter in the second layout and appends it to the `Mods` string.
5. Finally, it prints the modified text with the same capitalization and other characters as the original text.

The program follows the problem description and correctly maps the characters typed in the first layout to the second layout. It handles digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters correctly, maintaining the capitalization as required.
