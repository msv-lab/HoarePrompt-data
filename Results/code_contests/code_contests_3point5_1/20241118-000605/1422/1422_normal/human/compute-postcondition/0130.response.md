According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more tuples in the `ans` list. At the end of the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2` are initialized with the values from the first tuple in `ans`, `ans` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `cnt` is the number of tuples in `ans`, and label is set to 2 if the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`. 
To execute the loop one more time, the `ans` list must contain at least 2 tuples, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, and `ind2` need to be updated with the values from the next tuple in the `ans` list. `cnt` should be updated to reflect the number of tuples in `ans` after the update. 
State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2` are initialized with the values from the second tuple in `ans`, `ans` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `cnt` is the number of tuples in `ans`**
