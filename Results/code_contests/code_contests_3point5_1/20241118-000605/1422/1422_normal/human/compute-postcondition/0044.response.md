Postcondition: ***All variables retain their initial values and relationships after the execution of the if-else block. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`, and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `ans`, `one`, or `two`.***
