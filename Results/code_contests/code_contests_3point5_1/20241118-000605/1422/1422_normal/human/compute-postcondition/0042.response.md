Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `one` and `two` are dictionaries. `ans` is a list containing tuples with values `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`. `i` is 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` have integer values obtained from the input. `first` is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` respectively. `second` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`. `third` is a tuple containing the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If the key `third` exists in dictionary `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If the key `third` does not exist in dictionary `one`, no changes are made to `ans`, `one`, or `two`.***
