Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `ans`, `label`, `first`, `second`, `n` remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1. `a`, `b`, `c` are updated to the values in `challengers[i]`. If the minimum among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the new minimum value, and `first` is assigned the new value of `i`.***
