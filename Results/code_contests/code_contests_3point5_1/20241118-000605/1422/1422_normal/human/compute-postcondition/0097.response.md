Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `first` is assigned the tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `one` contains the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)) if `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`. `two` is updated with the value of `one[first][0] + c`. `ans` contains the appended tuple ((one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)). The relationships and values of `i+1`, `challengers`, `second`, and `third` are maintained according to the initial state. If `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, `one[third]` is updated to (a, i) and a new tuple (a, b, c) is appended to `challengers`.***
