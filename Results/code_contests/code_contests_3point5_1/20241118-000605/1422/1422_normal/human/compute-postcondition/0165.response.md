Postcondition: ***If label is equal to 1, then the program has calculated the minimum value among a, b, and c in each iteration and updated cnt with this minimum value. If the minimum value is greater than cnt, label is set to 1, cnt is updated, and first is assigned the index of the challenger. After the loop executes, a, b, c, ind1, ind2, ans, label, first, second, n remain unchanged. If n is 0 or ans is empty, the loop does not execute and all variables retain their initial values.***
