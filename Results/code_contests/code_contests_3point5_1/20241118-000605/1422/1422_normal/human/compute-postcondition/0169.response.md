Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0 and `ans` is not empty, the loop calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration and updates `cnt` with this minimum value. If the minimum value is greater than `cnt`, `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated, and `first` is assigned the index of the challenger. After the loop executes, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `ans`, `label`, `first`, `second`, `n` remain unchanged. If `n` is 0 or `ans` is empty, the loop does not execute and all variables retain their initial values. If `label` is equal to 1, stdout writes '1' followed by the index of the challenger incremented by 1. If `label` is not equal to 1, the loop did not execute, and all variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `ans`, `label`, `first`, `second`, `n`) retain their initial values. stdout writes '2' followed by the values `first + 1` and `second + 1` each separated by a space.***
