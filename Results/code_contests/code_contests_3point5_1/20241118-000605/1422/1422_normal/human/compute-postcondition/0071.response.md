Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, `i+1`, `challengers` are maintained as specified. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and a tuple is appended to `ans` containing `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is not in `one`, no changes are made. Overall, the program state after the if statement executes includes the updated values of `first`, `second`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` based on the conditions met.***
