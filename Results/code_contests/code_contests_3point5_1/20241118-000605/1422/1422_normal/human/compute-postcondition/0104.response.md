Postcondition: ***`first`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, `i+1`, `challengers`, `second`, and `third` are tuples maintaining their initial relationships and values. If `second` is in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. All other variables and relationships remain unchanged.***
