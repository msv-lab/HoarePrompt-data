Example Answer:
The tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `first`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values, and the list `challengers` contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`.
Output State: **`first`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values, `challengers` contains the tuple `(a, b, c)`**
