Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` contains a tuple with values `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` have integer values obtained from the input, `first` is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` respectively, `second` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is a tuple containing the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. The tuple `first` is in the dictionary `two`. The value of `two[first]` is less than the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`**
