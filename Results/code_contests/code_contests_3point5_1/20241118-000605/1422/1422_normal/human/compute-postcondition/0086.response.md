State: **After the execution of the if-else block in the previous iteration, the variables have been updated as mentioned. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.**
State: **`first` is assigned the tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `one` contains the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)) if `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values, `challengers` contains the tuple (a, b, c), `second` is assigned the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is assigned the tuple (max(b, c)). If `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, `one[third]` is updated to (a, i).**
