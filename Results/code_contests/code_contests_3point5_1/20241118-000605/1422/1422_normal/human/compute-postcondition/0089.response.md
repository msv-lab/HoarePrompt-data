Output State: **`first` is assigned the tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `one` contains the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)) if `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values, `challengers` contains the tuple (a, b, c), `second` is assigned the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is assigned the tuple (max(b, c)), and if `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, `one[third]` is updated to (a, i), and a new tuple (a, b, c) is appended to `challengers`.**
