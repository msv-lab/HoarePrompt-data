Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `ans`, `label` remain unchanged. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If the list `ans` is empty or `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and all variables remain in their initial empty state.**
