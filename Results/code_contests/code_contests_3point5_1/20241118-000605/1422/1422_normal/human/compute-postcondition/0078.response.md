Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables are in the following state:
- `first` is assigned the tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b))
- `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values
- `challengers` contains the tuple (a, b, c)
- `second` is assigned the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c))
- `third` is assigned the tuple (max(b, c))
- If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` appends a tuple containing `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`.
- The postcondition accounts for all possible scenarios, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the program variables are maintained throughout the execution of the if-else block.***
