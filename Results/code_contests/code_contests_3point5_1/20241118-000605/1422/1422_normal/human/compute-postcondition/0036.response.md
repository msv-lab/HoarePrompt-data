Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `one` and `two` are dictionaries, `ans` is a list containing tuples with values `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` have integer values obtained from the input, `first` is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` respectively, `second` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`, `third` is a tuple containing the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `(third in two)` evaluates to true, and `(two[third] < one[third][0] + c)` is true, then the actions specified in the precondition are taken. `ans` now contains an additional tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`, `two[third]` is assigned the value `one[third][0] + a**.
