Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2` are initialized with the values from the first tuple in `ans`, `ans` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `cnt` is the number of tuples in `ans`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, label is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`.***
