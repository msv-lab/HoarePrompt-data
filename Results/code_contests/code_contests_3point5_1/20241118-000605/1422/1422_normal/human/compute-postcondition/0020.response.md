Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, one is a dictionary, two is a dictionary containing a key 'first' with a value obtained by adding the first value of the tuple 'first' in dictionary 'one' with the value of c, ans is a list containing a tuple with elements (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), challengers contains a tuple (a, b, c), i is 0, a, b, and c have integer values obtained from the input, first is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values of a and b respectively, second is a tuple containing the maximum of a and c, and the minimum of a and c, third is a tuple containing the maximum of b and c, and the minimum of b and c. If the tuple 'first' is in the dictionary 'one', then dictionary 'two' is updated with the sum of the first value of 'first' in 'one' and 'c', and the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to 'ans'.***
