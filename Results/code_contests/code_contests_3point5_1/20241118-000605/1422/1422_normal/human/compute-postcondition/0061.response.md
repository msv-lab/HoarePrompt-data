Postcondition: ***Output State: `first` is assigned the tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values, `challengers` contains the tuple (a, b, c), `second` is assigned the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is assigned the tuple (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `two[first]` was initially less than `(one[first][0] + c)`, `ans` appends the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
