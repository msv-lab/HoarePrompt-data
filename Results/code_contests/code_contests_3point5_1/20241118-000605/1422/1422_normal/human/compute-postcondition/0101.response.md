Postcondition: ***`first`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, `i+1`, `challengers`, `second`, and `third` are tuples maintaining their initial relationships and values. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `first` is in `two` but `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, or if `first` is in `one` and not in `two`, nothing is modified. Additionally, if `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, `one[third]` is updated to `(a, i)`, and a new tuple `(a, b, c)` is added to `challengers`.***
