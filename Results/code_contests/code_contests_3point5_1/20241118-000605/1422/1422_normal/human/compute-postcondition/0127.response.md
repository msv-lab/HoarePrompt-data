Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2` remain initialized with the values from the first tuple in `ans`, `ans` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `cnt` is the number of tuples in `ans`. The minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is still greater than `cnt`; `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`.**
