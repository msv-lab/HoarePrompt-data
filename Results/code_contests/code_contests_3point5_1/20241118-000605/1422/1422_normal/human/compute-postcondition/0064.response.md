Postcondition: ***Output State: `first` is assigned the tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values, `challengers` contains the tuple (a, b, c), `second` is assigned the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is assigned the tuple (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of tuple `one[first]` and variable `c`, and `ans` appends a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, followed by the first element of `first`, second element of `first`, second element of `one[first]`, and `i`.***
