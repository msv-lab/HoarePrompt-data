Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables are updated as follows: `first` is assigned the tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `one` contains the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)) if `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values, `challengers` contains the tuple (a, b, c), `second` is assigned the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is assigned the tuple (max(b, c)). If `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, `one[second]` is updated to the tuple (b, i). The postcondition safeguards the integrity of the relationships and values among the variables, encompassing all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
