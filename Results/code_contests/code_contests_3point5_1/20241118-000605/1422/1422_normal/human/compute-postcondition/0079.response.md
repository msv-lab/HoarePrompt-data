Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables are updated as follows:
- `first` is assigned the tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b))
- `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values
- `challengers` contains the tuple (a, b, c)
- `second` is assigned the tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c))
- `third` is assigned the tuple (max(b, c))

If `third` is in `two`, and `two[third]` was initially less than `(one[third][0] + c)`, `ans` appends the tuple `(one[third][0] + c, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + c`.

If `third` is in `one` but not in `two`, `two[third]` is updated to the sum of the first element of tuple `one[third]` and variable `c`, and `ans` appends a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `one[third]` and `b`, followed by the first element of `third`, second element of `third`, second element of `one[third]`, and `i`.

If `third` is in `one` and not in `two`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and a tuple is appended to `ans` containing `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`.

The program state after the if-else block execution reflects the updated values of `first`, `second`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `i+1` based on the conditions met, while maintaining the integrity of the initial relationships and values of the program variables, covering all possible edge cases and scenarios.***
