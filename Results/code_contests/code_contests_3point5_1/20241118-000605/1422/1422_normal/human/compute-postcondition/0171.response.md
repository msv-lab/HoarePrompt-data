Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from standard input and then iterates `n` times. During each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, `c`, calculates certain values based on these inputs, and updates dictionaries `one`, `two`, and list `ans`. After the iterations, it determines the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` and updates `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` accordingly. Finally, if `label` is 1, it writes '1' followed by the index of the challenger incremented by 1 to standard output; otherwise, it writes '2' followed by the indices `first + 1` and `second + 1` separated by a space. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.**
