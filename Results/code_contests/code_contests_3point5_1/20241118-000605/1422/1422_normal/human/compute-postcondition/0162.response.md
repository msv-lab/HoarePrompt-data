Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `ans`, `label`, `first`, `second`, `n` remain unchanged except for `i` which is `i+1`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the new minimum value, and `first` is updated to the new value of `i`.***
