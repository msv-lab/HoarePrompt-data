Postcondition: ***`first`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, `i+1`, `challengers`, `second`, and `third` are tuples maintaining their initial relationships and values. If `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `one` and not in `two`, `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c`, and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, if `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, `one[third]` is updated to `(a, i)`, and a new tuple `(a, b, c)` is added to `challengers`.***
