Example Answer: 
The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the tuple `challengers[i]`, where `i` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `ans`, `label`, `first`, `second`, `n` remain unchanged except for `i` which is `i+1`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `ans`, `label`, `first`, `second`, `n` remain unchanged except for `i` which is `i+1`**
