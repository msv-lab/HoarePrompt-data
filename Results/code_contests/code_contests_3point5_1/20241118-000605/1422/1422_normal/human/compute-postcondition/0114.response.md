Postcondition: ***The tuples `first`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, `i+1`, `challengers`, `second`, and `third` maintain their initial relationships and values. If `first` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`, `one[first]` is updated to `(c, i)`. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `c + a`, a tuple `(c + a, third[0], third[1], c, i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[third]` is updated to `c + a`. If `third` is in `one` but not in `two`, `two[third]` is assigned the value of `c + a`, and a tuple `(c + a, third[0], third[1], c, i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not in either `two` or `one`, no changes are made to the variables. If `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, `one[third]` is updated to `(a, i)`, and a new tuple `(a, b, c)` is added to `challengers`. After the execution of the if statement, if `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `c + a`, and a tuple `(c + a, third[0], third[1], c, i)` is appended to `ans`.***
