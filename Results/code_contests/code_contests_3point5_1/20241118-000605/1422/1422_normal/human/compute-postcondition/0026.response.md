Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `one` and `two` are dictionaries. `ans` is a list containing tuples with values `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`. `i` is 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` have integer values obtained from the input. `first` is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` respectively. `second` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`. `third` is a tuple containing the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If the tuple `first` is in the dictionary `two`, and the value of `two[first]` is less than the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` and `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`. If the tuple `first` is in the dictionary `one`, then `two[first]` is updated with the sum of the first value of `first` in `one` and `c`, and the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, if `(two[second] < one[second][0] + c)` evaluates to true, the above actions are taken. `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. `two[second]` is updated with the value `one[second][0] + b`.***
