Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `one` and `two` are dictionaries. `ans` is a list containing tuples with values `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`. `i` is 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` have integer values obtained from the input. `first` is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` respectively. `second` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`. `third` is a tuple containing the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If the tuple `first` is in the dictionary `two`, and the value of `two[first]` is not less than the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, then `ans` is not appended and `two[first]` is not updated. If the tuple `first` is not in the dictionary `one`, then `two[first]` is not updated and no tuple is appended to `ans`.***
