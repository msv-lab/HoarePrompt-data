Postcondition: ***All variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `ans`, `label`, `cnt`, `first`, `second`, `n` remain unchanged except for `cnt` which is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, `label` is assigned 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is assigned the value of `i`. If the condition is not met, there are no changes to the variables. `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is not empty, and `a`, `b`, `c` are updated to the values in `challengers[i]`.***
