Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input read from `stdin`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown as they depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` have integer values obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` have integer values obtained from the input**
