According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `first`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, `c`, and `i` maintain their initial relationships and values. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **`first`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, `c` and `i+1` maintain their initial relationships and values**
