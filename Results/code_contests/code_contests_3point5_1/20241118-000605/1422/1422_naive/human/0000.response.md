Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes in the input as the number of stones, and the dimensions of each stone. It then calculates the potential volumes of different pairs of stones that can be glued together and stores them in a dictionary. The program then iterates through these potential volumes to find the maximum volume and selects the corresponding stones to present to Kostya.

The program considers all possible combinations of pairs of stones and calculates the volume of the new parallelepiped that can be formed by gluing them together. It then selects the pair of stones that would result in the maximum volume, or a single stone if it has the highest volume among all the stones.

Since the program considers all possible combinations of stones and correctly calculates the volumes, it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Hence, the program is correct.
