Output State: **`one`, `two`, `ans` are tuples with at least one element. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is assigned the current value of `i`. The variables `label` and `cnt` are updated accordingly. `i` is less than `n`. `label` is 1. `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. `first` is assigned the value of `i`.**
