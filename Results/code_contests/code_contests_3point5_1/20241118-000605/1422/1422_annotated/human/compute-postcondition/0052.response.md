Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `one`, `two`, and `ans` are updated based on multiple scenarios:
1. If `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is assigned the tuple `(a, i)`.
2. In all other cases where `third` is in `one` or `two`, and the required conditions are met, the variables `two`, `one`, and `ans` are updated following the specified logic. Each case ensures the correct modification of `two`, `one`, and the addition of tuples to `ans`, reflecting the updated state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.***
