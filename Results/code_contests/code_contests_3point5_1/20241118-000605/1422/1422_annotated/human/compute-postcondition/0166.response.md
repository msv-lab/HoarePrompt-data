Example Answer:
The code snippet prints '1' followed by a newline character and the value of first incremented by 1. The value of first is updated but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If n is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, one, two, and ans are tuples with at least one element. If the minimum value among a, b, and c is greater than cnt, label is set to 1, cnt is updated to the minimum value among a, b, and c, and first is assigned the current value of i. The variables label and cnt are updated accordingly. The other variables retain their initial values and first is updated.
