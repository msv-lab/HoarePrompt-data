Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list, `i` is incremented by 1, `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `first` is in `one`, then `two` at index `first` is assigned the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, and `ans` appends a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and the incremented value of `i`.***
