Output State: **If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, `one`, `two`, and `ans` are tuples with at least one element. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not greater than `cnt`, the program does not enter the if block and instead goes to the else block. The variables `label`, `cnt`, and `first` retain their initial values. stdout.write('2' + '\n' + str(first + 1) + ' ' + str(second + 1))**
