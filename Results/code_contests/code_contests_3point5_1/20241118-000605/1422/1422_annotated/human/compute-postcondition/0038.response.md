Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `third` is not in `two`, then the program updates `two[first]` to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[first]` and `c`, and appends a tuple containing that sum, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` to `ans`. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[second]` and `b`.***
