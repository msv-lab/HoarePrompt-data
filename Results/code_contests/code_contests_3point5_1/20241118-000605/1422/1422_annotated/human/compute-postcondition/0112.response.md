Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list, `i` is incremented by 1. `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, the function appends a tuple to `ans` with the sum of `one[third][0] + a`, the first element of `third`, the second element of `third`, the second element of `one[third]`, and the incremented value of `i`, and updates `two[third]` to `one[third][0] + a`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`, and a new tuple is appended to `ans` containing the sum of `one[third][0] + a`, the first element of `third`, the second element of `third`, the second element of `one[third]`, and the incremented value of `i`. All variables and lists are appropriately updated to handle all possible edge cases after the execution of the if else block.***
