Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list, `i` is incremented by 1. `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then the values in `ans` are updated with specific elements, and `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `one`, then `two` at index `first` is assigned the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, and `ans` appends a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and the incremented value of `i`. All the variables and lists are updated accordingly after the execution of the if else block, handling all possible edge cases.***
