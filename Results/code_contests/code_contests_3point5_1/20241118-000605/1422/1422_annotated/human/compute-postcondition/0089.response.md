Example Answer:
`first` is assigned the maximum value between `a` and `b` as the first element of the `challengers` list, and the minimum value between `a` and `b` as the second element. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown, so the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list, `i` is incremented by 1, `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list, `i` is incremented by 1, `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`**
