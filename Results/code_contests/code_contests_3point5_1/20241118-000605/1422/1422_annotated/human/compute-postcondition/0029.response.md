Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `one` is a dictionary that may contain the tuple `first`, `two` is a dictionary that may contain the tuple `first` with a value equal to the first element of `one[first]` plus `c`, `ans` is a list that may contain tuples consisting of `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from input, `first` is assigned the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`, `second` is assigned the tuple `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is assigned the tuple `(max(b, c), min(b, c)`, and `two[second]` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple `one[second]` plus `b`.**
