Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers newly assigned from the input and added to the `challengers` list. `first`, `second`, and `third` are determined based on the maximum and minimum values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `two[first]` is less than the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[first]` and `c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with the calculated values, and `two[first]` is updated with the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[first]` and `c`. If `first` is in the `one` list, then `two[first]` is updated with the sum of the first element of `one[first]` and `c`, and `ans` appends a tuple with the sum, first and second elements of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and the value of `i`. After the if statement executes, `two[second]` is assigned the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[second]` and `b`. If `second` is in the `one` list, a tuple with the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[second]` and `b`, `second[0]`, `second[1]`, `one[second][1]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. Finally, a tuple with the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[third]` and `a`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`.**
