Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `one` is a dictionary that may contain the tuple `first`, `two` is a dictionary that may contain the tuple `first` with a value equal to the first element of `one[first]` plus `c`, `ans` is a list that may contain tuples consisting of `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from input, `first` is assigned the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`, `second` is assigned the tuple `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is assigned the tuple `(max(b, c), min(b, c)`. The program fragment handles scenarios where `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, in which case `ans` is updated and `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c`. Additionally, if `first` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple containing that sum, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. After entering the if condition `(two[second] < one[second][0] + c)`, the overall state of the program is maintained as described above.***
