Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers, and they are assigned new values from the input and added to the list `challengers`. `first` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `b`, and the minimum of `a` and `b`. `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`. `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `two[first]` is less than the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[first]` and `c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with the calculated values, and `two[first]` is updated with the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[first]` and `c`. The program handles all possible edge cases and updates the variables accordingly.***
