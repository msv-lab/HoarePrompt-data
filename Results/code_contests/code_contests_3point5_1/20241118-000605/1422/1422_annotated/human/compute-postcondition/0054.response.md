Example Answer:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after being converted to integers using the `map` function. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are dependent on the input values provided. Since the initial state does not provide information about the input values, the output state will show the newly assigned values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input**
