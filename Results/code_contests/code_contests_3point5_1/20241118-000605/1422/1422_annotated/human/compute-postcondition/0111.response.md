Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list, `i` is incremented by 1. `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `second` is in `two`, then the values in `ans` are updated with specific elements, and `two[second]` is assigned the value of `one[second][0] + b`. If `second` is not in `two` but in `one`, `two[second]` is assigned the value of `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` appends a tuple containing the sum of `one[second][0] + b`, the first element of `second`, the second element of `second`, the second element of `one[second]`, and the incremented value of `i`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`, and a new tuple is appended to `ans` containing the sum of `one[third][0] + a`, the first element of `third`, the second element of `third`, the second element of `one[third]`, and the incremented value of `i`. All variables and lists are appropriately updated to handle all possible edge cases after the execution of the if else block.***
