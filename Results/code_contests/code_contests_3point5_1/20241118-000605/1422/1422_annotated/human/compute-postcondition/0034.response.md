Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. Depending on the conditions after entering the if condition, the program ensures that the variables `first`, `second`, `ans`, `two`, `one`, `c`, `b`, and `i` are updated accordingly. If `first` is present in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated with a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`, the first and second elements of `second`, the second element of `one[second]`, and `i`, and `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple containing that sum, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[second]` and `b`. This comprehensive postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases that may arise, ensuring the correct state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.***
