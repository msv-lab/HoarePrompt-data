Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[second]` and `b`. Additionally, a tuple containing this sum, the first and second elements of `second`, the second element of `one[second]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`.***
