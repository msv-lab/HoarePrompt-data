Example Answer: 
The tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`. As `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are added to the list `challengers`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input and added to the list `challengers`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input and added to the list `challengers`**
