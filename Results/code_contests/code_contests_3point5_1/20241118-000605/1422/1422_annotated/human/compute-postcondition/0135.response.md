Postcondition: ***`one`, `two`, and `ans` are not empty tuples. `label` is 2. `a`, `b`, `c`, `ind1`, and `ind2` are assigned values from the tuple elements in `ans`. `cnt` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `first` is assigned the value of `ind1` and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`.***
