Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `third` is not in `two`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple containing that sum, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[second]` and `b`. In the first case where `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is set to the sum of the first element of `one[third]` and `a`, and a tuple with this sum, the first element of `third`, the second element of `third`, the second element of `one[third]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. Otherwise, `two` remains unchanged.***
