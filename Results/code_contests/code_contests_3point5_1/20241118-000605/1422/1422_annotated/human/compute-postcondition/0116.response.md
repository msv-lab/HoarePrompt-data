Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list, `i` is incremented by 1. `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. If `first` is not in `one` or `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, `one[first]` is updated to `c, i`. If `second` is not in `one` or `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, `one[second]` is updated to `b, i`. All variables, lists, and conditions are appropriately updated to handle all possible edge cases after the execution of the if-else block.***
