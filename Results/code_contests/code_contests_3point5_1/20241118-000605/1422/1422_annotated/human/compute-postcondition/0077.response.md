Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers newly assigned from the input and added to the `challengers` list. `first`, `second`, and `third` are determined based on the maximum and minimum values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If conditions are met, tuples are appended to `ans` and values in `two` are updated accordingly.**
