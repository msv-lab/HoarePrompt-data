Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `one` is a dictionary containing the tuple `first`, `two` is a dictionary containing the tuple `first` with value `one[first][0] + c`, `ans` is a list containing the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from input, `first` is assigned the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`, `second` is assigned the tuple `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is assigned the tuple `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, and the tuple `first` is not in the dictionary `two`. If the tuple `first` is in the dictionary `one`, then the tuple `first` is added to the dictionary `two` with the value of the first element of `one[first]` plus `c`, and a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `one[first] and `c`, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` is appended to the list `ans`.***
