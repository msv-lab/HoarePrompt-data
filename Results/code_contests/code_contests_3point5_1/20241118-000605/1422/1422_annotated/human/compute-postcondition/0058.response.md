Example Answer:
`third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are new integers from the input, so the value of `third` will be based on those new inputs. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input and added to the list `challengers`; `first` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `b`, and the minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`; `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input and added to the list `challengers`; `first` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `b`, and the minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`; `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`**
