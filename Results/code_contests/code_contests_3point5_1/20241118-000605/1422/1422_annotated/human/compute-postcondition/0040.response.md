Output State: **`n` is greater than 0. If `third` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple containing that sum, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[second]` and `b`. Additionally, `two[third]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[third]` and `a`.**
