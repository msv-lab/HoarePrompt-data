Postcondition: ***If n is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, one, two, and ans are tuples with at least one element. If the minimum value among a, b, and c is greater than cnt, label is set to 1, cnt is updated to the minimum value among a, b, and c, and first is assigned the current value of i. The variables label and cnt are updated accordingly. If the minimum value among a, b, and c is not greater than cnt, the program does not enter the if block and instead goes to the else block where label, cnt, and first retain their initial values. Depending on the value of label, stdout.write outputs different strings.***
