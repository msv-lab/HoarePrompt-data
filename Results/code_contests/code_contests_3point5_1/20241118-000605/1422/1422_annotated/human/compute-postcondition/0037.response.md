Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. The if block handles scenarios where `first` is present in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, updating `ans` with a tuple comprised of the sum of the first element of `one[second]` and `b`, the elements of `second`, the second element of `one[second]`, and `i`, while assigning `two[first]` the value of `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is not in `two` but is in `one`, `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple with the results is appended to `ans`. If `second` is in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[second]` and `b`. This postcondition ensures the correct state of the program variables after executing the if-else block, handling all possible scenarios and edge cases effectively.***
