Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `one` is a dictionary that may contain the tuple `first`, `two` is a dictionary that may contain the tuple `first` with a value equal to the first element of `one[first]` plus `c`, `ans` is a list that may contain tuples consisting of `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, `challengers` contains a tuple `(a, b, c)`, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from input, `first` is assigned the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`, `second` is assigned the tuple `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is assigned the tuple `(max(b, c), min(b, c)`. The program fragment updates `two[first]` to the sum of the first element of the tuple `one[first]` and `c`, and appends a tuple containing that sum, the first element of `first`, the second element of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and `i` to `ans` when `second` is not in `two` but `first` is in `one`. The if condition checks if `second` is in `one`***
