Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers added to the list `challengers`. `first`, `second`, and `third` are assigned based on the maximum and minimum values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `first` is in list `one`, then `two[first]` is updated with the sum of the first element of `one[first] and `c`, and `ans` appends a tuple with the sum, first and second elements of `first`, the second element of `one[first]`, and the value of `i`. The program fragment handles all possible combinations of values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring the correct assignment of variables and updates to the data structures.***
