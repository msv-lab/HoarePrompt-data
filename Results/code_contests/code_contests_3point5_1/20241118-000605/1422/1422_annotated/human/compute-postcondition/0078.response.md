Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers added to the `challengers` list. `first`, `second`, and `third` are determined based on the maximum and minimum values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `third` is in the `one` list, `two[third]` is updated with the sum of the first element of the tuple in `one[third]` and `a`, and a new tuple is appended to `ans` with the calculated values. The postcondition ensures correct variable assignment and data structure updates, handling all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`, while considering edge cases related to input values and data structure contents.***
