Output State: **If N is 0, the loop does not execute. If N is greater than 0, after the loop executes, a and b are lists containing either two or three elements depending on the comparisons of c with the last elements of a and b. p remains a list of 2N integers. The variable fail is True if c is greater than both the last elements of a and b, otherwise fail is False.**
