Postcondition: ***N is a non-zero integer. After the loop executes, a and b are lists containing either two or three elements depending on the comparisons of c with the last elements of a and b. p remains a list of 2N integers. The variable fail is True if c is greater than both the last elements of a and b, otherwise fail is False.***
