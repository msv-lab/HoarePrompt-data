Output State: **N is a non-negative integer, p is a list of 2N integers, P is a non-empty list from func_3(), a is a list containing either two or three elements depending on the comparison of c with a[-1], b is a list containing a single element 10^5 and c, fail is True if c > a[-1] and c > b[-1], otherwise fail is False, c is assigned the second last element of P. If the length of list b and its last element is less than the length of list a and its last element, c is appended to list b. Otherwise, c is appended to list a. Additionally, if c is greater than the last element of a, a is appended with c resulting in a list of three elements. If c is not greater than the last element of a, fail is set to True. If c is greater than both the last element of a and the last element of b, fail is set to True and the program breaks. The condition (len(b), b[-1]) >= (len(a), a[-1]) holds true. If len(a) equals 1, c is appended to a. In all other cases, the initial conditions are maintained and the program continues without any changes.**
