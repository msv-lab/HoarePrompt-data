Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned a single element which is 10^5. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a non-negative integer representing the length of the arrays a and b, p is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation of length 2N. The values in the permutation list are distinct and within the range of 1 to 2N. P is assigned the return value of func_3(), a is a list containing a single element 10^5.
