Postcondition: ***N is a non-negative integer, p is a list of 2N integers, P is a non-empty list from func_3(), a is a list containing either two or three elements depending on the comparison of c with a[-1], b is a list containing either one or two elements depending on the comparison of c with b[-1], fail is True if c > a[-1] and c > b[-1], otherwise fail is False. If (len(b), b[-1]) < (len(a), a[-1]), c is appended to list b. If (len(b), b[-1]) >= (len(a), a[-1]), c is appended to list a. The conditions related to appending c to a or b are based on their lengths and the comparison of c with the last elements of a and b. The program handles cases where c is greater than the last element of a, where c is not greater than the last element of a, where c is greater than both the last elements of a and b, and where the lengths of a and b dictate the appending of c. In the case where len(a) equals 1, c is appended to a. If any of the specified conditions are not met, the program maintains its initial state without any changes.***
