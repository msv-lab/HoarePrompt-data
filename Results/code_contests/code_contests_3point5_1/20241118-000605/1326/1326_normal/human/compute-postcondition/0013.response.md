Postcondition: ***N is a non-negative integer, p is a list of 2N integers, P is a non-empty list from func_3(), a is a list containing two elements 10^5 and the last element of P, b is a list containing a single element 10^5, fail is True if c > a[-1] and c > b[-1], otherwise fail is False, c is assigned the last element of P, the length of array a is 2. If c is greater than the last element of a, fail is True, otherwise fail remains unchanged.***
