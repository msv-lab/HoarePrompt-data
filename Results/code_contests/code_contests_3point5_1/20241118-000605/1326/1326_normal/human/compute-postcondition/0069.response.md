Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer parameter `N`. The function initializes lists `a` and `b` with one element each, sets `fail` to False, and iterates over the elements in the list `P` in reverse order. Within the loop, elements from `P` are appended to either `a` or `b` based on comparisons with the last elements of `a` and `b`. If the length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, `fail` is set to True. Finally, if `fail` is True, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not have a return value.**
