Postcondition: ***N is a non-negative integer, p is a list of 2N integers, P is a non-empty list from func_3(), a is a list containing either two or three elements depending on the comparison of c with a[-1], b is a list containing a single element 10^5, fail is True if c > a[-1] and c > b[-1], otherwise fail is False, c is assigned the last element of P. If c is greater than the last element of a, a is appended with c resulting in a list of three elements. If c is not greater than the last element of a, fail is set to True. If c is greater than both the last element of a and the last element of b, fail is set to True and the program breaks. If c is greater than the last element of b, c is appended to b. The condition (len(b), b[-1]) >= (len(a), a[-1]) holds true.***
