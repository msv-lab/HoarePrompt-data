Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code implements the merge algorithm correctly based on the problem description.
- It handles the cases where one array is empty and returns the other array correctly.
- It correctly merges two non-empty arrays based on the comparison of their first elements.
- The code iterates over the permutation array in reverse order and places elements in arrays a and b accordingly.
- It checks if the final merged arrays have the correct length and prints 'YES' if they do, and 'NO' if they don't.
- The code also handles the test cases where n is specified correctly.
- The output hints describe the problem and solution approach accurately, further confirming the correctness of the code. No edge cases are found where the code does not follow the problem description.
