Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if a given permutation can be split into two arrays a and b such that merging them using the specified method results in the permutation. The program considers all possible cases and correctly determines whether such arrays exist or not. It iterates through the permutation in reverse order, appropriately adding elements to arrays a and b based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description. The program outputs "YES" if the permutation can be split into two arrays, otherwise it outputs "NO". The implementation covers all scenarios as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
