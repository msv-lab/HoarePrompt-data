Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes the input permutation and checks if it can be split into two arrays a and b such that when merged, it gives the original permutation. The program handles all cases where the elements need to be added to either array a or b based on the conditions provided. The program outputs "YES" if the permutation can be split into two arrays a and b, and "NO" otherwise. The code logic seems to cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
