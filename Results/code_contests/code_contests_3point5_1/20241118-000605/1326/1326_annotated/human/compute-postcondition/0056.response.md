Output State: **N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation with at least one element remaining to iterate over. If the length of list a is 1, a is now a list containing either five or seven integers, b is a list containing three or four integers, fail is True, c is the next element in the reversed P list. If c is greater than the last element of list a and c is greater than the last element of list b, then fail is set to True and the program breaks. If c is greater than the last element of list a, then c is added to list a and appended to list b. If c is greater than the last element of list b, c is appended to list b. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying the lists. `a` is updated by appending `c` to it.**
