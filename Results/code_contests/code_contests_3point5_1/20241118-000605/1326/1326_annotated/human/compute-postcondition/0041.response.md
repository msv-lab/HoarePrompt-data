Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation with at least one element, a is a list containing either four or six integers (100000, last element of P, c, last element of P, c) or (100000, last element of P, c, last element of P, c, c), b is a list containing three or four integers (100000, c), fail is True. If c is greater than the last element of a and b, then fail is set to True and the program breaks. If c is greater than the last element of a, then c is appended to the list a. If c is not greater than the last element of a, then c is appended to the list b. If c is greater than the last element of a and c is greater than the last element of b, then fail is set to True and the program breaks.***
