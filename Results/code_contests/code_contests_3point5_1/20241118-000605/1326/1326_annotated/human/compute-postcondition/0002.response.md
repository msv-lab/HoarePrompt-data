Example Answer:
`b` is assigned a list containing one integer 100000. The value of `b` is now [100000]. The initial states of `N`, `P`, and `a` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation, a is a list containing one integer 100000, b is a list containing one integer 100000**
