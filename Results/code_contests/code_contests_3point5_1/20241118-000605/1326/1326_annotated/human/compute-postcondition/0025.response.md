Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer. P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation with at least one element. a is a list containing either three integers (100000, last element of P, c) or four integers (100000, last element of P, c, last element of P), depending on the length of a before the execution of the program fragment. b is a list containing either one integer (100000, c) or two integers (100000, c), based on the condition of appending c to b. The variable fail is True if c is greater than the last elements of a and b; otherwise, fail is False. If the length of a is 2 before the execution, the last element of P is appended to a; if the length of a is 1 before the execution, the last element of P is appended to a. Additionally, c is greater than the last elements of both a and b. In the if part, c is appended to b if the length of b and the last element of b are less than the length of a and the last element of a, respectively. In the else part, c is appended to a if c is not greater than the last element of b; otherwise, the loop continues without any changes.***
