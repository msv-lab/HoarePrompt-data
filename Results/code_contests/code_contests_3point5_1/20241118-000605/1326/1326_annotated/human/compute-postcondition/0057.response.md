Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation with at least one element remaining to iterate over. If the length of list a is 1, a is now a list containing either five or seven integers, b is a list containing three or four integers, fail is True if c is greater than the last element of list a and list b, c is the next element in the reversed P list. If (len(b), b[-1]) < (len(a), a[-1]), c is appended to list b. Otherwise, c is appended to list a.***
