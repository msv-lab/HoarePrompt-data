Postcondition: ***If P is an empty list, the loop does not execute. If P is not empty, N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation with at least one element remaining to iterate over. If the length of list a is 1, a is now a list containing either three or four integers, b is a list containing either one or two integers. If (len(b), b[-1]) < (len(a), a[-1]), c is appended to list b. Otherwise, c is appended to list a. If the length of list a is not equal to N + 1, then fail is set to True. If fail is true, the program prints 'NO'. If fail is false, the program prints 'YES'.***
