Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`, which is a positive integer. It assumes that `P` is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation. The function iterates over the elements of `P` in reverse order and appends them to lists `a` and `b` based on certain conditions. If the length of list `a` is not equal to N + 1, the function sets `fail` to True. If `fail` is True, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not have a specified return value.**
