Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer. P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation with at least one element. a is a list containing three integers: 100000, the last element of P, and c. b is a list containing one integer 100000 and c. fail is True if c is greater than the last element of a and c is greater than the last element of b, otherwise fail remains False. If the length of a is 2, then the last element of P is appended to a; if the length of a is 1, the last element of P is appended to a. c is greater than the last element of a and b. If c is greater than the last element of b, then c is appended to b; otherwise, the loop continues without any changes. Additionally, the length of b and the last element of b are less than the length of a and the last element of a.***
