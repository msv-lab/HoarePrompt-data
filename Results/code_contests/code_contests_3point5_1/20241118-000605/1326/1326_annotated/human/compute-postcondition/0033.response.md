Output State: **N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation with at least one element, a is a list containing five integers (100000, last element of P, c, last element of P, c), b is a list containing two integers (100000, c), fail is True, the length of list a is 1, the value c is appended to the list a. If c is greater than the last element of a and c is greater than the last element of b, then fail is set to True and the program breaks.**
