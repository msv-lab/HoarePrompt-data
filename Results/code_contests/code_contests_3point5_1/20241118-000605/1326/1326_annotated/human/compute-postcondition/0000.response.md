Example Answer: 
The function `func_3()` is called, and it returns a list of 2N integers representing a permutation. The initial state mentions that P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation. Therefore, after executing `P = func_3()`, the output state will be: **N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation**.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation**
