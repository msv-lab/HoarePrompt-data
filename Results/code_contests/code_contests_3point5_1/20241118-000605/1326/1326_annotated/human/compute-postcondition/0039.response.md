Output State: **N is a positive integer, P is a list of 2N integers representing a permutation with at least one element, a is a list containing either four or six integers (100000, last element of P, c, last element of P, c) or (100000, last element of P, c, last element of P, c, c), b is a list containing three or four integers (100000, c), fail is True if c is greater than the last element of a and b, then fail is set to True and the program breaks.**
