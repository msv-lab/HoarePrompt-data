Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the program reads the input integer `n` and the permutation array `P`.
3. The program then processes the permutation array `P` using the merge function and determines if there exist arrays `a` and `b` that can be merged to obtain the permutation array `P`.
4. The logic within the `func_4` function correctly handles the merging of the arrays `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the problem description.
5. The program outputs "YES" if there exist arrays `a` and `b` that can be merged to obtain the permutation array `P`, otherwise it outputs "NO".

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for each test case.
