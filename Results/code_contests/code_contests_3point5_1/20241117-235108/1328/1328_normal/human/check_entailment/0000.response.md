# Your task:

Problem description: You have a knapsack with the capacity of W. There are also n items, the i-th one has weight w_i.

You want to put some of these items into the knapsack in such a way that their total weight C is at least half of its size, but (obviously) does not exceed it. Formally, C should satisfy: ⌈ W/2⌉ ≤ C ≤ W.

Output the list of items you will put into the knapsack or determine that fulfilling the conditions is impossible.

If there are several possible lists of items satisfying the conditions, you can output any. Note that you don't have to maximize the sum of weights of items in the knapsack.

After analyzing the provided code and description, it seems that the code does follow the problem description for every potential case. Here's the reasoning:

1. The code correctly handles the cases where an item's weight is greater than or equal to half the knapsack's capacity and less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity. It outputs the index of that item if found, fulfilling the condition of putting at least one item in the knapsack.

2. The code also handles the case where all items are heavier than the knapsack's capacity. In this scenario, it correctly outputs -1, indicating that no solution is possible.

3. Additionally, the code considers multiple possibilities of selecting items to reach a total weight between half the capacity and the full capacity of the knapsack. It outputs any valid combination of items that satisfies the conditions.

Since the code covers all the potential cases as described in the problem statement and the hints provided do not suggest any additional cases that the code might not handle, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
