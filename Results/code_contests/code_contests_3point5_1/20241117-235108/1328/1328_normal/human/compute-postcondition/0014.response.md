According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `args`. If there are more elements in `args`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have more elements, and `x` should be the next element in `args` after the current `x`.
State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`**
