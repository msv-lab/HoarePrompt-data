Example Answer:
The `sep` string is written to the file. The values of `at_start`, `args`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`**
