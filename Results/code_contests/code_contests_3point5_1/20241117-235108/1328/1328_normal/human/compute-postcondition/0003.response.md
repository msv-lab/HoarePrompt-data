According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is a non-empty iterable, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `at_start` being True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `args` is a non-empty iterable and `x` is the first element in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is True, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args**.
