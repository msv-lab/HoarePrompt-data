Example Answer:
The value of `x` is written to the file as a string. If `at_start` is False, then the `sep` is written to the file. The value of `at_start` remains False, `args` still contains elements, and `x` is updated to the next element in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`**
