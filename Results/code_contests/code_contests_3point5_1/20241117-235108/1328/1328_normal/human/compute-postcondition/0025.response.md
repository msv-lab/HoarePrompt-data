The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on the predefined constraints and relationships provided as the precondition. The function is responsible for handling multiple test cases, where each test case involves positive integers `n` and `W`, and a list of positive integers `w_i`. The function does not return any specific output based on the inputs, but instead, it performs certain operations or computations based on the constraints and relationships provided in the precondition. 

Functionality: **The function `func_2` operates on multiple test cases with predefined constraints and relationships, without accepting any parameters, and performs specific operations or computations based on the inputs.**
