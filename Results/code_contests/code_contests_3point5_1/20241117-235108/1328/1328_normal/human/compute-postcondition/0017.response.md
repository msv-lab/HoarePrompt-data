Example Answer:
The value of `x` is written as a string to the file. If `at_start` is False, then the value of `sep` is written to the file before `x`. The state of `at_start` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is a boolean, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is a boolean, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`**
