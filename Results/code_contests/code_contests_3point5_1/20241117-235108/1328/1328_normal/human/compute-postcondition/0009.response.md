According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `args`. If there are more elements in `args` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have elements left to iterate over and `x` should be the next element in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`.**
