Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` command writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is not given in the initial state, so the output state will depend on the value of `sep` that is written to the file. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`**
