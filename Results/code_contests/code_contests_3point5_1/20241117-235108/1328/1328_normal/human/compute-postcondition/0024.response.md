Postcondition: ***Output State: `args` is a non-empty iterable and `at_start` is False. `file.write` is called with the argument `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If the `flush` key with a value of True is present in `kwargs`, `file.flush()` is executed. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
