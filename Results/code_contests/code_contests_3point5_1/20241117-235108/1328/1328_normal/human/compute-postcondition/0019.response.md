According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `args` iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, and `x` is the next element in `args`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `at_start` needs to remain False, `args` must still have more elements, and `x` should be the next element in `args` after the current one. 
State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `x` is the next element in `args` after the current one**
