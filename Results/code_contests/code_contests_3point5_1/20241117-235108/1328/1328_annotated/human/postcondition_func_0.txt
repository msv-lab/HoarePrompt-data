The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It is expected to read `t` test cases where each test case consists of `n`, `W`, and a list of `w_i` values. These values represent the number of items, the capacity of the knapsack, and the weights of the items respectively. The function processes the test cases and performs operations based on the input parameters provided for each test case. However, the actual processing and operations performed within the function are not detailed in the annotations.
