**Precondition:**

- The input consists of t test cases, where each test case contains:
  - Two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and W (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18).
  - n integers representing the weights of the items, where each weight w_i is in the range 1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
