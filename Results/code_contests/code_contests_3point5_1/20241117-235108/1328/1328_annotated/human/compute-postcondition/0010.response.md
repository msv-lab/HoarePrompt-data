Example Answer: 
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the value of `sep` which is a space character. The `file` is `sys.stdout` by default. The value of `at_start` is `False`, and `args` has at least two elements. After execution, the space character is written to the output. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least two elements.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least two elements**
