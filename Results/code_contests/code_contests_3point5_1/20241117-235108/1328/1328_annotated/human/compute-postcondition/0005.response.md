Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`, with a space separator. The previous values of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout by default, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one element.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout by default, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one element**
