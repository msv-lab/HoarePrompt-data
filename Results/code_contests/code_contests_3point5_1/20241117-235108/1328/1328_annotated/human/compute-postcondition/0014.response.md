According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `args` list that haven't been iterated over yet. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least two elements. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in the `args` list needs to be considered. 
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least three elements**
