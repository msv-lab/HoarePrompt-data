Example Answer: 
The `write` function writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. Since `sep` is ' ', a space is written to the standard output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least three elements.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least three elements**
