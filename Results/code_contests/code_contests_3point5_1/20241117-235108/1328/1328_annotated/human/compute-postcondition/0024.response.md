Postcondition: ***If `args` is an empty list, the loop does not execute. If `args` has at least one element, the loop iterates through each element, writing it to `file` separated by `sep`. After the loop executes, `sep` remains ' ', `file` remains sys.stdout, and `at_start` is False. `kwargs` may have had 'end' popped from it. If 'flush' is True in `kwargs`, then `file` is flushed, `sep` remains ' ', `file` remains sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, and 'end' has been popped from `kwargs`, the value of 'flush' has been popped from `kwargs`.***
