Functionality: **The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and iterates through a list of arguments, writing them to the standard output with a separator. If the arguments list is empty, the loop does not execute. After writing the arguments, it writes an end character to the output stream. Additionally, if the 'flush' keyword argument is True, it flushes the output stream.**
