According to the code, the loop can execute if `args` has at least one element. Before the loop starts, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout by default, and `at_start` is True do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only adjustment needed for the loop to execute is that `args` has at least one element.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout by default, `at_start` is True, `args` has at least one element**
