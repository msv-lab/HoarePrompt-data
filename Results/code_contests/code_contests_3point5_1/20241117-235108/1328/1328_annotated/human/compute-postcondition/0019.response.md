According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `args` list. If there are still elements left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, and `args` has at least three elements. To execute the loop one more time, `args` must have at least four elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, `args` has at least four elements**
