According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `args` list. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout by default, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, the `args` list must have at least two elements in it.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout by default, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least two elements**
