Example Answer: 
The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values from `kwargs` by popping 'sep' and 'file' keys respectively. If these keys are not present in `kwargs`, default values are used (' ' for `sep` and `sys.stdout` for `file). The Output State is: `sep` is ' ' by default, `file` is sys.stdout by default.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ' by default, `file` is sys.stdout by default**
