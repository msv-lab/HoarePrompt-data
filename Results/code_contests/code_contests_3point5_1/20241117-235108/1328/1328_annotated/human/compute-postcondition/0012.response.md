Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The values of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least two elements.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least two elements**
