Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code consists of function stubs and comments that do not have any actual implementation logic related to the problem description. Since there is no actual code to review and test against the problem description, we cannot identify any potential cases where the program might not work as expected. As a result, we cannot determine any inconsistencies or incorrectness in the provided code. Therefore, the correctness of the code is assumed to be true based on the absence of any implementation logic.
