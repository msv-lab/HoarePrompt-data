Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case.
2. It checks if there is an item that can be put into the knapsack to meet the conditions.
3. If no single item satisfies the conditions, it then iterates through the items to find a combination that meets the conditions.
4. It handles the case where no solution exists by outputting -1.
5. The program outputs the correct list of items that satisfy the conditions.
