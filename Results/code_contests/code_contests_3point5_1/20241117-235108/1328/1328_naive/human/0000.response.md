Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as described. It checks for conditions where an item's weight falls between ⌈ W/2⌉ and W, and also handles cases where all items are larger than the knapsack's capacity. Additionally, the program outputs the correct list of items to be put into the knapsack or -1 if there is no solution. The logic in the code seems to be sound and covers all possible scenarios as outlined in the problem description.
