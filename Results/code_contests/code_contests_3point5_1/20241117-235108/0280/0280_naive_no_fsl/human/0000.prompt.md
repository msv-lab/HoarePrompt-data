You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Captain Marmot wants to prepare a huge and important battle against his enemy, Captain Snake. For this battle he has n regiments, each consisting of 4 moles.

Initially, each mole i (1 ≤ i ≤ 4n) is placed at some position (xi, yi) in the Cartesian plane. Captain Marmot wants to move some moles to make the regiments compact, if it's possible.

Each mole i has a home placed at the position (ai, bi). Moving this mole one time means rotating his position point (xi, yi) 90 degrees counter-clockwise around it's home point (ai, bi).

A regiment is compact only if the position points of the 4 moles form a square with non-zero area.

Help Captain Marmot to find out for each regiment the minimal number of moves required to make that regiment compact, if it's possible.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of regiments.

The next 4n lines contain 4 integers xi, yi, ai, bi ( - 104 ≤ xi, yi, ai, bi ≤ 104).

Output

Print n lines to the standard output. If the regiment i can be made compact, the i-th line should contain one integer, the minimal number of required moves. Otherwise, on the i-th line print "-1" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

4
1 1 0 0
-1 1 0 0
-1 1 0 0
1 -1 0 0
1 1 0 0
-2 1 0 0
-1 1 0 0

1 1 0 0
-1 1 0 0
-1 1 0 0
-1 1 0 0
2 2 0 1
-1 0 0 -2
3 0 0 -2
-1 1 -2 0


Output

1
-1
3
3

Note

In the first regiment we can move once the second or the third mole.

We can't make the second regiment compact.

In the third regiment, from the last 3 moles we can move once one and twice another one.

In the fourth regiment, we can move twice the first mole and once the third mole.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
