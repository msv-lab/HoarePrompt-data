According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already executed, so to execute one more time, `p` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop. `p` is incremented by 1.**
