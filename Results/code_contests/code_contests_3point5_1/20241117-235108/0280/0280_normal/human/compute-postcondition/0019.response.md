Example Answer:
`prime[i]` is updated to `False`, indicating that the number at index `i` in the `prime` list is no longer a prime number. The other variables `p`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this update.
Output State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is a prime number, `n` is greater than or equal to `p*p`, `i` is the next multiple of `p` greater than `n` and less than or equal to `n`, and `prime[i]` is now False**
