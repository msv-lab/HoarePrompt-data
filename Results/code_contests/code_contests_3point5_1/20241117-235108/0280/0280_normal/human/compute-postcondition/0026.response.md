Example Answer: 
The value at index `i` in the list `prime` is updated to `False`. The variable `p` has been incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`.
Output State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`**
