Example Answer:
All elements in the list `prime` are updated where `prime[i]` is set to `False`. The value of `p` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`.
Output State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`**
