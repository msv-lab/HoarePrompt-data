According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `n`. If `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is incremented by 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`. To execute the loop one more time, `p * p` should be less than or equal to `n+1` and `p` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`**
