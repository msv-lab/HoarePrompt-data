According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the range of `i` defined by `p * p` and `n + 1`, and the step size `p`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `p * p`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the range should be adjusted such that the new `p` value is within the range of `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` and `n + 1`, and the step size remains the same as `p`. Additionally, the state of `n` should be adjusted to ensure it is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`.

State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`**
