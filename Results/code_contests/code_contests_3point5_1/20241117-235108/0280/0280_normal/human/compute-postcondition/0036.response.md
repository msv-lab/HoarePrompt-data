Output State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated based on the loop conditions. 'p' is incremented by 1 in each iteration. If 'n' is less than or equal to 'p * p' or 'p' is not a prime number, the loop does not execute. If 'prime[p]' is True, then for each element 'i' in the range from 'p * p' to 'n', inclusive, with a step size of 'p', the corresponding element in 'prime' is set to False.**
