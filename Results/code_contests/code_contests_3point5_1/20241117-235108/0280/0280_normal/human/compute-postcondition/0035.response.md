According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `n`. If `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is incremented by 1. If `n` is not greater than or equal to `p * p`, the loop does not execute. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated based on the loop conditions, `p` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`**
