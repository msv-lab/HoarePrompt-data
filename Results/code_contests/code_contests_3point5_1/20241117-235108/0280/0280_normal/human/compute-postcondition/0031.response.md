According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` has been incremented by 1 and `n` is still greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `(p + 2) * (p + 2)`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is now incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 2) * (p + 2)`**
