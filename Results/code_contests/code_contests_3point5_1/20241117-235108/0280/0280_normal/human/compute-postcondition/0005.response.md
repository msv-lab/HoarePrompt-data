According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the range defined by `range(p * p, n + 1, p)`. At the end of the previous iteration, some elements in the list `prime` are now False. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `p` should be such that it corresponds to an element in the list `prime` that is still True after the modification. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Some elements in the list `prime` are now False**
