According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is a prime number, `n` is greater than or equal to `p*p`, `i` is the next multiple of `p` greater than `n` and less than or equal to `n`, and `prime[i]` is now False. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next multiple of `p` greater than the current `i` but still less than or equal to `n`.
State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is a prime number, `n` is greater than or equal to `p*p`, `i` is the next multiple of `p` greater than the current `i` and less than or equal to `n`, and `prime[i]` is now False**
