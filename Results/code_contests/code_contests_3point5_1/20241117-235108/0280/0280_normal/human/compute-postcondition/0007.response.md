According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, some elements in the list `prime` are now False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the condition `p * p <= n` must still hold true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Some elements in the list `prime` are now False**
