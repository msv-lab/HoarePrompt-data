Postcondition: ***All elements in the list `prime` are initialized to `True` for indices 0 to n. If `prime[p]` is initially `True`, the loop updates the elements in the list `prime` to `False` for indices that are multiples of `p` starting from `p*p` up to `n`. If `p*p` is greater than `n`, the loop does not execute. The state of the program after the execution of the if statement ensures that the list `prime` correctly reflects the updated values based on the conditions specified.***
