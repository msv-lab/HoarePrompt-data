Example Answer:
The value of `prime[i]` is set to False. This means that at index `i`, the value of `prime` is now False. Since no specific value of `i` is mentioned, we cannot determine which index is affected. Therefore, the output state is that some elements in the list `prime` are now False.
Output State: **Some elements in the list `prime` are now False**
