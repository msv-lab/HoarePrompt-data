Postcondition: ***'p' is 4, 'n' is greater than 2, 'f' is a list containing 3 and 4 if the value of 'prime' at index 3 is True. If prime at index p is True, then 'p' is appended to the list 'f'. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables and 'f' remains as a list containing 3 if the value of 'prime' at index 3 is True.***
