Example Answer: 
The value of 'p' is appended to the list 'f'. Since 'p' is 3, the updated list 'f' will contain 2, 3. The values of 'n' and the elements in the list 'prime' are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 'p' is 3, 'n' is greater than 2, 'f' contains 2, 3.
Output State: **'p' is 3, 'n' is greater than 2, 'f' contains 2, 3**
