Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in the list `prime` is updated to `False`. The values of `p` and `n` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is a prime number, `n` is greater than or equal to `p*p`.
Output State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is a prime number, `n` is greater than or equal to `p*p`**
