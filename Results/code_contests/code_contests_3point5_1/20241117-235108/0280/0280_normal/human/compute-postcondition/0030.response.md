Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in the list `prime` is updated to `False`. The value of `p` has been incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is now incremented by 1, and `n` is still greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`.
Output State: **All elements in the list `prime` have been updated, `p` is now incremented by 1, and `n` is still greater than or equal to `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`**
