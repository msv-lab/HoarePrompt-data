The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each set of 4 integers xi, yi, ai, bi are such that -104 <= xi, yi, ai, bi <= 104. After executing the function body, the program returns all prime numbers up to 'n' stored in the list 'f' or an empty list if 'n' is less than or equal to 2 or if there are no prime numbers found. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_8 is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range, and return a list of prime numbers up to 'n' or an empty list if no prime numbers are found or if 'n' is less than or equal to 2.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n within the range 1 to 100, and returns a list of prime numbers up to n or an empty list if n is less than or equal to 2 or if there are no prime numbers found**.
