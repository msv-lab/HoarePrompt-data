Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in the list `prime` is set to `False`. The previous value of `prime` is unknown, but after this operation, the value at index `i` is definitely `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: Some elements in the list `prime` are now False.
Output State: **Some elements in the list `prime` are now False**
