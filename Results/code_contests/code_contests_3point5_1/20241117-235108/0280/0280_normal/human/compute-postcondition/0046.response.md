Example Answer:
The value of 'p' is appended to the list 'f'. Since 'p' is 4, after execution, 'f' will contain [3, 4]. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 'p' is 4, 'n' is greater than 2, 'f' is a list containing 3 and 4.
Output State: **'p' is 4, 'n' is greater than 2, 'f' is a list containing 3 and 4**
