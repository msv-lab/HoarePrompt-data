Example Answer:
All elements in the list `prime` are initialized to `True` for indices 0 to n. The list `prime` has a length of n+1 elements. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `prime` are initialized to `True` for indices 0 to n.
Output State: **All elements in the list `prime` are initialized to `True` for indices 0 to n**
