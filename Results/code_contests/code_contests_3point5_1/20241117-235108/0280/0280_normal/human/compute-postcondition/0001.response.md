Example Answer:
The value of `p` is assigned as 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `prime` are initialized to `True` for indices 0 to n, `p` is 2.
Output State: **All elements in the list `prime` are initialized to `True` for indices 0 to n, `p` is 2**
