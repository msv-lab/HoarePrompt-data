The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It first ensures that both `x` and `y` are positive by taking their absolute values. Then, it checks if the minimum value between `x` and `y` is 0. If so, it returns the maximum value between `x` and `y`. After that, it performs a while loop to update the values of `x` and `y` based on a specific formula until `y` becomes 0. Finally, it returns the maximum value between the updated `x` and `y`.

It seems that the annotations describe the functionality accurately for the provided cases. However, it would be important to note that if the initial values of `x` and `y` are 0, the function might not behave as expected since the condition to check the minimum value between `x` and `y` being 0 might not hold true. This edge case could lead to unexpected behavior.
