Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `arr` where `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5, `i` is the index of the last element checked, `n` is the total number of elements in `arr`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. The result of `int(math.floor(count / 3))` is printed.**
