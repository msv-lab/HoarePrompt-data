Example Answer:
The values from input are mapped to integers and stored in the list `arr`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, `arr` contains the mapped integers from input.
Output State: **1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, `arr` contains the mapped integers from input**
