Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1.0, and the previous value of `count` is 1.0. After execution, `count` becomes 2.0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2.0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`count` is 2.0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
