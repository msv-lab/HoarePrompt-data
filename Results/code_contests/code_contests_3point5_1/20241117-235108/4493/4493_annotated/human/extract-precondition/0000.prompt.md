You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: The Saratov State University Olympiad Programmers Training Center (SSU OPTC) has n students. For each student you know the number of times he/she has participated in the ACM ICPC world programming championship. According to the ACM ICPC rules, each person can participate in the world championship at most 5 times.

The head of the SSU OPTC is recently gathering teams to participate in the world championship. Each team must consist of exactly three people, at that, any person cannot be a member of two or more teams. What maximum number of teams can the head make if he wants each team to participate in the world championship with the same members at least k times?

Input

The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 5). The next line contains n integers: y1, y2, ..., yn (0 ≤ yi ≤ 5), where yi shows the number of times the i-th person participated in the ACM ICPC world championship.

Output

Print a single number — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

5 2
0 4 5 1 0


Output

1


Input

6 4
0 1 2 3 4 5


Output

0


Input

6 5
0 0 0 0 0 0


Output

2

Note

In the first sample only one team could be made: the first, the fourth and the fifth participants.

In the second sample no teams could be created.

In the third sample two teams could be created. Any partition into two teams fits.
Program:
```
import math
def func():
    (n, k) = raw_input().split()
    (n, k) = (int(n), int(k))
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    count = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] + k <= 5:
            count += 1.0
    print(int(math.floor(count / 3)))
```
