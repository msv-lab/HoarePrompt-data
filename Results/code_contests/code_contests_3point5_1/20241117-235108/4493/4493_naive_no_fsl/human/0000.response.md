Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of teams that can be formed based on the given conditions. It iterates through the list of participants and checks if each participant can form a team with others based on the number of times they have participated. The count of valid teams is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of teams that can be formed. The logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately.
