Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, then reads a list of integers `arr`.
- It iterates over the elements of `arr` and counts the number of elements whose sum with `k` is less than or equal to 5.
- Finally, it prints the integer division of this count by 3, which represents the maximum number of teams that can be formed with the given conditions.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly calculates the number of teams that can be formed based on the input constraints and conditions provided.
