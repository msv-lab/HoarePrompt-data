Example Answer:
The `arr` variable is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input obtained by splitting the raw input. As the initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are integers within the specified range, the values of `n` and `k` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers within the specified range, and `arr` contains the list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the specified range, `arr` contains the list of integers obtained from the input**
