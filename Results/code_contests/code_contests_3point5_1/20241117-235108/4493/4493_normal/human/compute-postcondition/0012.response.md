Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1.0, so the new value of `count` becomes 3.0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is within the specified range, `arr` contains integers obtained from the input, `count` is 3.0, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is within the specified range, `arr` contains integers obtained from the input, `count` is 3.0, `i` is 2**
