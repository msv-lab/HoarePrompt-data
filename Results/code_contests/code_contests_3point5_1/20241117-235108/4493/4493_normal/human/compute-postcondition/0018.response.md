Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, then reads a list of integers `arr`. It iterates over the elements of `arr` and counts the number of elements whose sum with `k` is less than or equal to 5. Finally, it prints the integer division of this count by 3. The function calculates the total count of elements in `arr` meeting the specified condition, ensuring integer division in the final output.**
