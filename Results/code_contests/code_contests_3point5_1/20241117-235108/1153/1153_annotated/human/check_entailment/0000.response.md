Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes the input of the trump suit and two different cards. It then compares the ranks and suits of the two cards based on the rules of the "Durak" card game. The program correctly determines whether the first card beats the second card or not and prints the result accordingly. The logic in the code seems to be correct and handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
