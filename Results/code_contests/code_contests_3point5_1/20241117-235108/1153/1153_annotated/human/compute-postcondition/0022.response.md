Output State: **`s` is a single character representing the trump suit, `s2` is a list containing two strings representing different cards, `m1` is the string '6789TJQKA', `i` is 0, `ts` is the character being iterated over in `m1`, `r1` is the index of the first character in `s2[0]` that matches the characters in `m1` if such a match exists and `ts` is equal to the first character of the second string in `s2`, otherwise `r1` remains 0. If `s2` is empty, the loop does not execute and `r1` remains 0, `r2` is assigned the value of `i`.**
