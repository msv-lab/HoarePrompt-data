Postcondition: ***If `s2` is not empty, after the loop executes, `r1` will be the index of the first character in `s2[0]` that matches the characters in `m1` if such a match exists, otherwise `r1` remains 0. If `ts` matches the first character of the second string in `s2`, `r2` will be assigned the index `i`, otherwise `r2` remains 0. If `s2` is empty, the loop does not execute and `r1` remains 0. Additionally, `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` and `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s[0]`***
