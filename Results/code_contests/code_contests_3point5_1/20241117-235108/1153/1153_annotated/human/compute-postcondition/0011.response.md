Postcondition: ***`s` is a single character representing the trump suit, `s2` is a list containing two strings representing different cards, `m1` is the string '6789TJQKA', `i` is 2, `ts` is the second character in `m1` which is '7', `r1` is an integer. If the second character in `m1` matches the first character of the first string in `s2`, `r1` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `r1` remains unchanged at 0.***
