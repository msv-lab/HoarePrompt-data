Postcondition: ***If `s2` is not empty and the condition `s2[0][1] == s2[1][1]` and `r1 > r2` is satisfied, then `r1` will be the index of the first character in `s2[0]` that matches the characters in `m1`, otherwise `r1` remains 0. If `ts` matches the first character of the second string in `s2`, `r2` will be assigned the index `i`, otherwise `r2` remains 0. If `s2` is empty, the loop does not execute and `r1` remains 0. If the condition is not met, `r1` remains 0 and `r2` will be 0.***
