Functionality: **The function `func` reads input strings representing cards and a trump suit. It then checks if the two cards have the same suit. If they have the same suit and the index of the first card's rank in the predefined string '6789TJQKA' is greater than the index of the second card's rank, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If the two cards have different suits and the first card's suit matches the trump suit, it prints 'YES', else 'NO'. If the input list of cards is empty, it always prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
