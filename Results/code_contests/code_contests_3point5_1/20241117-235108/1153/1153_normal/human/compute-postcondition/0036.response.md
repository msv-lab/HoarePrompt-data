Output State: **`m1` is a non-empty list, the loop iterates through each element `ts` in `m1`, if the rank of the second card in `s2` matches `ts`, `r2` is updated to the index of `ts` in `m1`. If no match is found, `r2` remains unchanged. After the loop, `r2` contains the index of the matching rank in `m1`, `s` is a valid suit, `s2` is a list of two valid cards where the rank of the second card is different from the first card and matches the rank of the first card in `s`, `i` is the total number of iterations of the loop. `print('YES')` is executed.**
