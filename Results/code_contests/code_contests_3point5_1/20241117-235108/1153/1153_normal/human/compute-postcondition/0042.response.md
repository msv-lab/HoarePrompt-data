Postcondition: ***`m1` is not empty. After the loop, `r2` contains the index of the matching rank in `m1`, `s` is a valid suit, `s2` is a list of two valid cards, `i` is the total number of iterations of the loop. If the second card in `s2` has the same suit as the first card and the rank of the first card is greater than the rank of the second card, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the second card in `s2` has a different suit than the first card, or if `r1` is less than or equal to `r2`, then 'NO' is printed.***
