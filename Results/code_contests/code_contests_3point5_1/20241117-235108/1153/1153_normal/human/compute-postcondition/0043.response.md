Postcondition: ***`m1` is a list that may or may not be empty. If `m1` is empty, the loop does not execute. If `m1` is not empty, the loop iterates through each element `ts` in `m1`. If the rank of the second card in `s2` matches `ts`, `r2` is updated to the index of `ts` in `m1`. If no match is found, `r2` remains unchanged. After the loop, `r2` contains the index of the matching rank in `m1`, `s` is a valid suit, `s2` is a list of two valid cards. If the rank of the second card in `s2` is different from the first card and matches the rank of the first card in `s`, 'YES' is printed. If the rank of the second card in `s2` matches the first card and the second card has the same suit as the first card, and if `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the second card in `s2` has a different suit than the first card, or if `r1` is less than or equal to `r2`, 'NO' is printed.***
