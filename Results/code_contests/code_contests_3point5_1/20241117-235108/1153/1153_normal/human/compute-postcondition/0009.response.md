According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m1`. If `m1` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a valid suit, `s2` is a list of two valid cards, `m1` is not empty, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `m1` list must still be not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a valid suit, `s2` is a list of two valid cards, `m1` is not empty, `i` is 1**
