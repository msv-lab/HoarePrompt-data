Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the trump suit, two different cards, compares their ranks and suits, and prints 'YES' if the conditions for beating the second card are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The code handles all the rules of the "Durak" card game as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
