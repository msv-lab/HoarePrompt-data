Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly handle the case when the second card is a trump card. In the description of the problem, it is mentioned that a trump card can beat any non-trump card regardless of rank. However, the program only checks if the suits are the same and the rank of the first card is higher than the second card. It does not consider the case where the second card is a trump card. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
