Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input of the trump suit and two different cards.
2. The program correctly assigns the ranks of the cards based on the input.
3. The program then checks if the first card beats the second card according to the rules of the game "Durak" as described in the problem statement.
4. The conditions for determining if the first card beats the second card are implemented correctly:
   - If the suits are different and the first card is the trump suit, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the suits are the same and the rank of the first card is higher, it returns 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
5. Thus, the program correctly determines whether the first card beats the second card based on the input provided.
