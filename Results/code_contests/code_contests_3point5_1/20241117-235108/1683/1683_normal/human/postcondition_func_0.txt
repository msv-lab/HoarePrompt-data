The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the standard input, followed by a list of integers `a`. It then reverses the list `a`, removes duplicates, and prints the number of unique elements in the list followed by those unique elements in reverse order. If `n` is greater than 0, the function produces the unique elements in reverse order based on the input list `a`. If `n` is 0, the function prints nothing as the loop does not execute.
