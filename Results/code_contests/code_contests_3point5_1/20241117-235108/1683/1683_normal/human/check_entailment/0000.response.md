Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. It reads an integer `n` from the standard input, followed by a list of integers `a`. It then reverses the list `a`, removes duplicates, and prints the number of unique elements in the list followed by those unique elements in reverse order. The code correctly handles the case where the number of elements in Petya's array is 0, as the loop does not execute in that scenario. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear understanding of how the code operates. Overall, the code appears to be functioning as expected.
