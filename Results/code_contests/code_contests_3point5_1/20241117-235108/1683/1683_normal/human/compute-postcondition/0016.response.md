Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length n and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list. If `ai` is in `vis`, the program continues without altering `ans` or `vis`. If `ai` is not in `vis`, `ai` is appended to `ans`, and `ai` is added to `vis`. After the execution of the if else block, `ans` contains all unique elements of the reversed list `a` in the order they appear, and `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`.***
