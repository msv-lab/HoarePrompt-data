Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()`. The value of `n` is a positive integer as per the precondition. The list `a` is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of integers with length n, where each element of `a` is in the range [1, 1000].
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of integers with length n, where each element of `a` is in the range [1, 1000]**
