Example Answer:
`ai` is added to the set `vis`, which contains all unique elements encountered so far. Since `ai` is now added to `vis`, it becomes a part of the unique elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n` and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with the addition of `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n` and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with the addition of `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`**
