Example Answer:
If `n` is greater than 0, `ans` will contain all unique elements of the reversed list `a` in the order they appear, and `vis` will contain all unique elements encountered so far. If `n` is 0, `ans` and `vis` will remain empty. The length of `ans` will be printed. The output state will depend on the values of `n`, `ans`, and `vis` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **Dependent on the values of `n`, `ans`, and `vis` after the execution of the code.**
