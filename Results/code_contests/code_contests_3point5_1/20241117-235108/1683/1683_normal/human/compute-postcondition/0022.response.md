According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n` and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with the addition of `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `ai` needs to be processed. This means `ai` should be added to `ans` if it is not already in `vis`, and `ai` should be added to `vis`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n` and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with the addition of `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`.**
