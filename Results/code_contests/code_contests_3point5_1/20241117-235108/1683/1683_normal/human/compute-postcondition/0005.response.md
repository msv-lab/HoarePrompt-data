According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `a` has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, the list `a` is of length `n`, which is a positive integer, and the elements in `a` are reversed. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that the list `a` has at least 1 element, and `ai` represents the first element of the reversed list `a`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length n and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the first element of the reversed list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is an empty set**
