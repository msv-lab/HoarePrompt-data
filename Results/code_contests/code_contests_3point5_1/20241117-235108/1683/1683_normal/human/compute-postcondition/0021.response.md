Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n` and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with the addition of `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`. If `ai` is already in `vis`, the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, `ai` is appended to `ans`, and `ai` is added to `vis`. The program ensures that `ans` contains unique elements in the order they appear in the reversed list of `a`, and `vis` includes all unique elements encountered, including `ai`, after the execution of the if-else block.***
