Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length n and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the first element of the reversed list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `ai`, `vis` is a set containing `ai`. If `ai` is already in `vis`, the program continues without modifying `ans` or `vis`. Otherwise, `ai` is appended to `ans` and added to `vis`. After execution, `ans` contains `ai` and `vis` contains `ai` ensuring no duplicates in `vis` and `ans` contains the unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list.***
