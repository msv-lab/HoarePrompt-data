Example Answer:
The list `a` is reversed using the `[::-1]` slicing notation. The order of elements in the list `a` is reversed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length n, where the elements in `a` are reversed.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length n, where the elements in `a` are reversed**
