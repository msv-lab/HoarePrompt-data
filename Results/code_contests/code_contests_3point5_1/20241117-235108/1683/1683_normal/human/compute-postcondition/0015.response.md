Example Answer:
The element `ai` is added to the set `vis`. The set `vis` now contains the unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length n and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with `ai` appended, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far including `ai`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length n and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with `ai` appended, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far including `ai`**
