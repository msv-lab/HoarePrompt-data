Example Answer:
The next element `ai` in the reversed list `a` is appended to the list `ans`. The list `ans` now contains this new element `ai`. The lists `a` and `vis` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n` and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with the addition of `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n` and at least 1 element, elements in `a` are reversed, `ai` is the next element in the reversed list `a`, `ans` contains unique elements of `a` in the order they appear in the reversed list with the addition of `ai`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, including `ai`**
