You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya has an array a consisting of n integers. He wants to remove duplicate (equal) elements.

Petya wants to leave only the rightmost entry (occurrence) for each element of the array. The relative order of the remaining unique elements should not be changed.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of elements in Petya's array.

The following line contains a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1 000) — the Petya's array.

Output

In the first line print integer x — the number of elements which will be left in Petya's array after he removed the duplicates.

In the second line print x integers separated with a space — Petya's array after he removed the duplicates. For each unique element only the rightmost entry should be left.

Examples

Input

6
1 5 5 1 6 1


Output

3
5 6 1 


Input

5
2 4 2 4 4


Output

2
2 4 


Input

5
6 6 6 6 6


Output

1
6 

Note

In the first example you should remove two integers 1, which are in the positions 1 and 4. Also you should remove the integer 5, which is in the position 2.

In the second example you should remove integer 2, which is in the position 1, and two integers 4, which are in the positions 2 and 4.

In the third example you should remove four integers 6, which are in the positions 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Program:
```
n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
a = a[::-1]
ans = []
vis = set({})
for ai in a:
    if ai in vis:
        continue
    else:
        ans.append(ai)
        vis.add(ai)
print(len(ans))
print(' '.join(map(str, ans[::-1])))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
