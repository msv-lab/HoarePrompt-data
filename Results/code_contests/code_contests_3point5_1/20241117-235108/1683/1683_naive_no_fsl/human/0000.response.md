Correctness: True

The program correctly removes duplicate elements from the array while keeping only the rightmost occurrence of each element. It iterates through the array in reverse order, adding elements to the `ans` list only if they have not been visited before. The final output also displays the correct number of elements and the array after removing duplicates. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
