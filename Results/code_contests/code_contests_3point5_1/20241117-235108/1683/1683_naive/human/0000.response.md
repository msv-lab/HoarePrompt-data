Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly removes duplicate elements from the array while maintaining the rightmost occurrence of each unique element. It iterates through the array in reverse order, keeping track of visited elements using a set. If an element has not been visited before, it is added to the result list. Finally, it prints the count of unique elements and the list of unique elements in the correct order. The program covers all possible cases described in the problem statement and correctly implements the required logic.
