Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to remove duplicate elements from the array while preserving the rightmost occurrence of each unique element. It iterates over the array in reverse order, keeping track of unique elements using a set. The final output is the count of unique elements and the array with only the rightmost occurrences.

The program handles the given problem description for all potential cases:
1. When there are no duplicate elements in the array
2. When there are duplicate elements in the array
3. When all elements in the array are the same
4. When the array contains a mix of unique and duplicate elements

For each case, the program produces the correct output as per the problem description. Therefore, the program can be considered correct.
