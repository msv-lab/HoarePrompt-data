According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the next element in the array `a` is not already in the set `vis`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers in reverse order, `ai` is the last element in the reversed array `a`, `ans` contains `ai`, and `vis` contains `ai`. To execute one more time, the next element after `ai` in the reversed array `a` should not be in the set `vis`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers in reverse order, `ai` is the second last element in the reversed array `a`, `ans` contains `ai`, `ans` is added to the set `vis`**
