Output State: 
The loop iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. If an element `ai` is already in the set `vis`, the loop continues without any changes. Otherwise, `ai` is appended to the list `ans` and added to the set `vis`. The loop will execute at least once if `a` contains at least one unique element. If all elements in `a` are duplicates, the loop will not execute, and `ans` and `vis` will remain empty.
If the loop executes:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50
- array `a` contains n integers in reverse order
- `ai` is the last unique element in the reversed array `a`
- `ans` contains unique elements from `a`
- `vis` is a set containing unique elements from `a`

If the loop does not execute:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50
- array `a` contains n integers in reverse order
- `ans` is an empty list
- `vis` is an empty set
