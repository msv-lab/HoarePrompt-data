Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers in reverse order, `ai` is the last element in the reversed array `a`, `ans` is a list containing `ai`, and `vis` is a set containing `ai`. If `ai` is already in the set `vis`, the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, `ai` is appended to `ans` and added to the set `vis`. All possible scenarios considering the edge cases are covered after the execution of the if else block.***
