Output State: **If the loop executes: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers in reverse order, `ai` is the last unique element in the reversed array `a`, `ans` contains unique elements from `a`, `vis` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, and the length of `ans` is printed. If the loop does not execute: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers in reverse order, `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is an empty set.**
