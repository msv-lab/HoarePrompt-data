Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, followed by a list of integers `a` in reverse order. It then creates a list `ans` containing unique elements from `a` while maintaining the original order. If there are duplicate elements in `a`, only the last occurrence of each unique element is kept in `ans`. Finally, the function prints the count of unique elements in `ans` followed by those elements in reverse order. The function does not accept any parameters.**
