Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the input string to integers after splitting it by spaces. The length of the list `a` is equal to `n`, which is between 1 and 50. Each element in `a` is between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000**
