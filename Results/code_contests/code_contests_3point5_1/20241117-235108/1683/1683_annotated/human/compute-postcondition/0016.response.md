Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 50, array a contains n integers in reverse order, ai is the second last element in the reversed array a, ans contains ai, ans is added to the set vis. If ai is already in vis, the program continues without modifying any variables. Otherwise, ai is appended to ans and added to vis. The state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
