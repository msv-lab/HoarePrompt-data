Example Answer:
The array `a` is reversed using the `[::-1]` slicing method. This means that the order of elements in the array `a` is reversed. The size of the array `a` remains the same, but the elements are now in reverse order.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000, the elements in array `a` are reversed**
