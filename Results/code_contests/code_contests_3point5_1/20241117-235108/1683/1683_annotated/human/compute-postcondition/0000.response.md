Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer read from standard input after stripping any leading/trailing whitespaces. The value of `n` will be between 1 and 50. The array `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000 (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1 000)**.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000 (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1 000)**
