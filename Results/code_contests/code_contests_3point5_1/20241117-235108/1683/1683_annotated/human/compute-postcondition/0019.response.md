Example Answer:
The value of `ai` is taken from the last element of the reversed array `a`, and it is then appended to the list `ans`. If `ai` is not already in the set `vis`, then `ai` is also added to `vis`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers in reverse order, `ai` is the last element in the reversed array `a`, `ans` contains `ai`, `ai` is added to the set `vis`.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50, array `a` contains n integers in reverse order, `ai` is the last element in the reversed array `a`, `ans` contains `ai`, `ai` is added to the set `vis`**
