Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values for the number of TV sets and the number of TV sets Bob can carry. It then takes the prices of the TV sets as input, sorts them in ascending order, takes the first 'm' elements, and calculates the sum of the negative prices (as Bob earns money for buying those TV sets). Finally, it prints the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn. 

This logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The program handles the case where Bob can carry all the TV sets, as well as the scenario where Bob can carry fewer TV sets than the total number of TV sets available. The output also matches the expected output based on the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
