Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from user input as described in the problem statement.
- It then reads a list of integers, sorts it, and calculates the negative sum of the first `b` elements of the sorted list, which aligns with the requirement of selecting the TV sets that Bob can carry to maximize the sum of money earned.
- The code handles the case where Bob can carry all TV sets (m = n) by sorting the list and taking the negative sum of all elements, ensuring the correct output.
- The code also correctly handles the case where some TV sets have negative prices, as it calculates the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn regardless of the sign of the prices.
