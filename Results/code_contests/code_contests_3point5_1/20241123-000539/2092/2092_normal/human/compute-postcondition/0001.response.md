Example Answer:
The function r() returns two values, assigning them to variables a and b. The values of a and b are unknown as they are returned from the function. Therefore, the output state is: n, m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100, ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, a and b are returned from the function r().
Output State: **n, m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100, ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, a and b are returned from the function r()**
