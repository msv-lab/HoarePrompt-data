Example Answer:
The function r() returns two integers a and b. The code then sorts the returned values and takes the sum of the negative values up to index b. The sorted values are summed and negated before printing. The initial state does not provide specific values for a and b, so we cannot calculate the exact output. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100, ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, a and b are returned from the function r().
Output State: **n, m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100, ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, a and b are returned from the function r()**
