Example Answer:
The lambda function `r` takes input from the user, splits it into a list of integers, and then maps each element to an integer. Since the initial state does not mention any specific values for `n` and `m`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **n, m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100. ai are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000.**
