Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by the function `r()`. The function `r()` returns two values. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The list of TV set prices contains n integers ranging from -1000 to 1000, a and b are values returned by the function r().
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The list of TV set prices contains n integers ranging from -1000 to 1000, a and b are values returned by the function r()**
