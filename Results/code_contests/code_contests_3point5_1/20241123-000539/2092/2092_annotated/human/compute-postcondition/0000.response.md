Example Answer:
The lambda function `r` takes input from the user, splits it into integers, and maps them. The input should contain `n` integers. Since the input is not specified, the values of `n` and `m` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The list of TV set prices contains n integers ranging from -1000 to 1000.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The list of TV set prices contains n integers ranging from -1000 to 1000**
