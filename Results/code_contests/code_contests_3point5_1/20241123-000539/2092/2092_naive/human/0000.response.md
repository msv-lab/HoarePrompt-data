Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly reads the input values, sorts the prices of the TV sets in ascending order, takes the first 'm' elements (as Bob can carry at most 'm' TV sets), calculates the sum of the prices, and then negates it to get the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn. The logic is sound, and the program works as expected for all potential cases.
