According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` iterating through the elements in `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is greater than or equal to `val`, the loop appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if `res[sosed]` equals 0. The variables `HM`, `nodes`, `sosed`, `cur`, `val` are updated to the value of `res[ind]`, `ind` is 2, and `res` is unchanged. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `ind` needs to be updated to the next index, which is 3.

State: **HM is greater than or equal to val, the loop iterates through the elements in nodes[3], appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val are updated to the value of res[3], ind is 3, and res is unchanged**
