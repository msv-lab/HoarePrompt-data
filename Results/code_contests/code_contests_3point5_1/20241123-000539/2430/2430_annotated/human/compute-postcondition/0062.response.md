According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `val`, `ind`, `res`, `HM`, and the contents of `nodes`. 

1. The loop will execute again if `val` is less than or equal to `HM`.
2. The loop will execute again if `nodes[ind]` is not empty.
3. The loop will execute again if `res[sosed]` is 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `cur` needs to be modified
- `val` needs to be incremented by 1
- `ind` needs to be updated to the first element popped from the queue
- `res` needs to be updated with the new value of `val` at index `ind`

No specific adjustments are needed for `HM`, as it is not mentioned to be modified in the loop body.

State: **`cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, `res` is updated with the new value of `val` at index `ind`**
