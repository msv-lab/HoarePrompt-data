According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute again are based on the values of `HM`, `val`, `res[sosed]`, and the elements in `nodes[ind]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. If HM is greater than val.
2. If res[sosed] equals 0.

No other specific states are mentioned in the provided information, so the rest of the states remain the same.
State: **HM is greater than val, res[sosed] equals 0**
