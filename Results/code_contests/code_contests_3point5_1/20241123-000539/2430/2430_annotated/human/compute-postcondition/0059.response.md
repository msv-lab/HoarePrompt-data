Postcondition: ***`cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, `res` is updated with the new value of `val` at index `ind`, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, there are still elements in the list `nodes[ind]`, and if `res[sosed]` is 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue.***
