Example Answer:
`ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`, and `cur` represents the front of the queue. Therefore, `ind` now holds the value at the front of the queue. The value of `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, but it is not explicitly stated in the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `HM is 51`, `cur` is the front of the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value at the front of the queue.
Output State: **`HM is 51`, `cur` is the front of the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value at the front of the queue**
