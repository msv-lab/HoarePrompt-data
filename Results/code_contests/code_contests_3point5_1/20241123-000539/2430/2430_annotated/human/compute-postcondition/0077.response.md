Functionality: The function `func_1` takes in a list of tuples `queue`, an integer `n`, and a list of lists `nodes`. It iterates through the elements in the queue, updating values based on certain conditions. If the maximum value in the resulting list `res` exceeds a calculated threshold `HM`, it returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, it modifies elements in `res` based on the comparison with 26 and generates a string by mapping each element in `res` to its corresponding character using a specific formula. The function handles the addition of new elements to the queue based on specific criteria and updates the values in `res` accordingly. If the loop does not execute, the state remains the same as the initial state. 

Missing functionality: It would be helpful to clarify the specific criteria or conditions that determine when a new element should be added to the queue, as well as the significance of the calculated threshold `HM` and its relation to the elements in `res`.
