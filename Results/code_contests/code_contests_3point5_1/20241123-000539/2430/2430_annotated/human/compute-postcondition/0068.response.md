Output State: **HM is greater than or equal to val, the loop iterates through the elements in nodes[ind], appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val is updated to the value of res[ind], ind is incremented by 1, and res is unchanged. `res` has a length greater than 0, `ind` is 1, and `res[ind]` is the first element in `res`**
