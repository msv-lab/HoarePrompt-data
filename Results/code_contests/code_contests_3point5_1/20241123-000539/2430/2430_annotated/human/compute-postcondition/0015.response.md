Example Answer:
A new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. The variables HM, nodes, ind, sosed, cur, and res are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is greater than val, nodes has elements at index ind, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], cur is updated to the next element in the queue, val is updated accordingly, ind is assigned the next value in the queue, res[ind] is updated to val, and a new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.
Output State: **HM is greater than val, nodes has elements at index ind, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], cur is updated to the next element in the queue, val is updated accordingly, ind is assigned the next value in the queue, res[ind] is updated to val, and a new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.**
