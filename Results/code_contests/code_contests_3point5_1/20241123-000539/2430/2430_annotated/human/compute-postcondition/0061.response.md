Output State: **After the loop executes, `cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, `res` is updated with the new value of `val` at index `ind`. If `val` is greater than HM, the loop terminates. If `val` is less than or equal to HM and `nodes[ind]` is not empty, the loop appends a new list containing `sosed` and the updated `val` to the queue. If there are no elements in `nodes[ind]` or if `res[sosed]` is not 0, the loop will not execute.**
