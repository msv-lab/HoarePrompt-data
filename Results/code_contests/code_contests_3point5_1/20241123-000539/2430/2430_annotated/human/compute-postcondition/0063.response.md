Output State: **If HM is greater than val, the loop will iterate through the elements in nodes[ind] and append a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val, ind, and res will be updated accordingly after each iteration. If the loop does not execute, the state will remain the same as the initial state.**
