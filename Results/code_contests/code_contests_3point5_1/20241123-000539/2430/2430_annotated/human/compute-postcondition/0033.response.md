Postcondition: ***HM is greater than val, res[sosed] is 0, cur holds the value popped from the queue, val is assigned the value from cur[1], ind is assigned the value of cur[0], val is incremented by 1. After the if statement where val > HM, res[ind] is updated to val. Sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind. If res[sosed] is 0, [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.***
