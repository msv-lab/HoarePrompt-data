Postcondition: ***HM is greater than val, res[sosed] is 0, cur holds the value popped from the queue, val is assigned the value popped from cur[1], ind is assigned the value popped from cur[0], val is incremented by 1, res[ind] is updated, sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind. If res[sosed] is 0, [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. If res[sosed] is not 0, no new elements are added to the queue.***
