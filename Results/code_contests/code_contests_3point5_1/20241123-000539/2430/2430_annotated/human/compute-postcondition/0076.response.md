The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. `queue` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer representing the city index and an integer representing the rank of the officer assigned to that city. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the total number of cities. `nodes` is a list of lists representing the tree connections between cities.

After executing the function, the variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val, ind, and res are all updated accordingly. If the maximum value in res is greater than HM, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, for each element in res, if the value is greater than 26, it is replaced by its difference from 2 * 26. The function iterates through all elements in res, updating values accordingly. The final output is a string generated by mapping each element in res to its corresponding character based on the formula chr(26 - x + ord('A')). If the loop does not execute, the state remains the same as the initial state.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `queue`, an integer `n`, and a list of lists `nodes`. It updates various variables based on the input parameters and returns a string generated from the updated values. If the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, it returns 'Impossible!'.**
