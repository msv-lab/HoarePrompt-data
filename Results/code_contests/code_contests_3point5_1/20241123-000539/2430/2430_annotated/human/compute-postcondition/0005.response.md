Example Answer: 
The value of `val` is assigned to `res[ind]`. The value of `HM` is 51, `cur` is the front of the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value at the front of the queue. After execution, the value of `res[ind]` will be updated to `val`. Therefore, the Output State is: `HM is 51`, `cur` is the front of the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value at the front of the queue, and `res[ind]` is updated to `val`.
Output State: **`HM is 51`, `cur` is the front of the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value at the front of the queue, and `res[ind]` is updated to `val`**
