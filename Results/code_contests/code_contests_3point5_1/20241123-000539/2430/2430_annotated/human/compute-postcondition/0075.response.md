Postcondition: ***HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val, ind, res are all updated accordingly. If max(res) is greater than HM, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, for each element in res, if the value is greater than 26, it is replaced by its difference from 2 * 26. The loop iterates through all elements in res, updating values accordingly. The final output is a string generated by mapping each element in res to its corresponding character based on the formula chr(26 - x + ord('A')). The state remains the same as the initial state if the loop does not execute.***
