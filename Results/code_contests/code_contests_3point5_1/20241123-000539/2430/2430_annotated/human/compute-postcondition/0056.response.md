Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, `res` is updated with the new value of `val` at index `ind`, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, and `nodes[ind]` is not empty. If the value at index `sosed` in `res` is 0, then a new list containing `sosed` and the updated `val` is appended to the queue.***
