Example Answer:
The value at the front of the queue is removed and assigned to the variable `cur`. Since the initial state is `HM is 51`, after executing the code, the value of `cur` will be the value at the front of the queue, and the queue will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `HM is 51`, `cur` is the value at the front of the queue, and the queue is updated.
Output State: **`HM is 51`, `cur` is the value at the front of the queue, and the queue is updated**
