Example Answer:
`val` is assigned the value of the second element of `cur`. The previous values of `cur` and the queue are unknown, so the output state is: `cur` is the first element popped from the queue, and the queue is modified accordingly, `val` is the second element of `cur`.
Output State: **`cur` is the first element popped from the queue, and the queue is modified accordingly, `val` is the second element of `cur`**
