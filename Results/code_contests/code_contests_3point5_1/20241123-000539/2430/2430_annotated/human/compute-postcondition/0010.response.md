According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nodes`, `ind`, and `HM`. In order for the loop to execute, `nodes` must have elements at the index `ind`, and `HM` must be greater than the value of `val`. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to `HM` is greater than `val`, `nodes` has elements at index `ind`, and `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`.
State: **`HM` is greater than `val`, `nodes` has elements at index `ind`, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`, `cur` is the front of the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value at the front of the queue, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`**
