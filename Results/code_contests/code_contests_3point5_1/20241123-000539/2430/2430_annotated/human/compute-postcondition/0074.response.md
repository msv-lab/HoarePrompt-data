Output State: **The loop updates the values in res by replacing any element greater than 26 with its difference from 2 * 26. HM is greater than or equal to val, the loop iterates through the elements in nodes[ind], appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val are updated to the value of res[ind], ind is incremented by 1, and res remains unchanged after each iteration. If the loop does not execute, the state remains the same as the initial state.**
