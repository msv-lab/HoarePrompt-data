Example Answer:
`val` is assigned the value `cur[1]`, where `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue. The initial state mentions that HM is greater than val, so after execution, the output state is HM is greater than val, res[sosed] equals 0, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, and `val` is assigned the value from `cur[1]`.
Output State: **HM is greater than val, res[sosed] equals 0, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the value from `cur[1]`**
