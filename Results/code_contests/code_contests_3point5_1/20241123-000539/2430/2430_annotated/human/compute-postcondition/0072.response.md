Example Answer: 
The variable `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`, where `ind` is 3. Since `ind` is 3, `val` will be updated to the value of `res[3]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is greater than or equal to val, the loop iterates through the elements in nodes[3], appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val are updated to the value of res[3], ind is 3, and res is unchanged, and val is updated to the value of res[3].
