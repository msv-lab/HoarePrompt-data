Example Answer: 
The variable `cur` is assigned the value popped from the front of the queue. The value of `cur` will depend on the content of the queue, but the state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is greater than val, res[sosed] equals 0, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue.
Output State: **HM is greater than val, res[sosed] equals 0, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue**
