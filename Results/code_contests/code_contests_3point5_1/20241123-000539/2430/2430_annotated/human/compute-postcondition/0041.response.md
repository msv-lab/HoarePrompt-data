Output State: **After the loop executes, the variables will be in the same state as before the loop started. This is because the loop will not execute if `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, meaning no new elements will be added to the queue. Therefore, the values of `HM`, `res[sosed]`, `cur`, `val`, `ind`, `sosed`, and the queue will remain the same.**
