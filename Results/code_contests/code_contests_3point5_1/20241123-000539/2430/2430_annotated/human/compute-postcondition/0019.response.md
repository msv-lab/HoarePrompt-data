Postcondition: ***HM is greater than val, nodes contains elements at index ind, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], cur is updated to the next element in the queue, val is updated accordingly, ind is assigned the next value in the queue, res[ind] is updated to val. If res[sosed] equals 0, then a new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. After the if statement executes, the state remains the same as the precondition, with the addition of a new list [sosed, val] appended to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. All other variables maintain their previous values and relationships.***
