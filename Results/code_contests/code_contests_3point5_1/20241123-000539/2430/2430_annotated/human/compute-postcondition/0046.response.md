Example Answer: 
The value of `val` is assigned to the index `ind` in the list `res`. The value of `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, and the value of `val` is the second element of `cur`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is `cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, and the list `res` is updated with the value of `val` at index `ind`.
Output State: **`cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, `res` is updated with the value of `val` at index `ind`**
