Example Answer: 
`ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, where `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, and `val` is assigned the value from `cur[1]`. The value of `ind` is now based on the value at index 0 of the popped item from the queue. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is greater than val, res[sosed] equals 0, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the value from `cur[1]`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`.
Output State: **HM is greater than val, res[sosed] equals 0, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the value from `cur[1]`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]**
