According to the code, the loop can execute if `nodes[ind]` is not empty. Before the loop starts, the conditions that need to be adjusted are as follows:
`cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, `res` is updated with the new value of `val` at index `ind`, and `val` is less than or equal to HM.
