Example Answer:
A new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. The variables are affected as follows: cur, val, ind, and res[ind] are updated accordingly. If res[sosed] equals 0, a new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. The output state is: HM is greater than val, nodes contains elements at index ind, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], cur is updated to the next element in the queue, val is updated accordingly, ind is assigned the next value in the queue, res[ind] is updated to val, a new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0.
Output State: **HM is greater than val, nodes contains elements at index ind, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], cur is updated to the next element in the queue, val is updated accordingly, ind is assigned the next value in the queue, res[ind] is updated to val, a new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0.**
