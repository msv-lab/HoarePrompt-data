According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` iterating through the length of `res`. If `ind` is less than the length of `res`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, HM is greater than or equal to val, the loop iterates through the elements in nodes[3], appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val are updated to the value of res[3], ind is 3, and res is unchanged, and val is updated to the value of res[3]. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the index `ind` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `res`.
State: **HM is greater than or equal to val, the loop iterates through the elements in nodes[3], appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val are updated to the value of res[3], ind is less than the length of res, and res is unchanged, and val is updated to the value of res[3]**
