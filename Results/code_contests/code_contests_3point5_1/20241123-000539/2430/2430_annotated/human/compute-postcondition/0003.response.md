Example Answer:
The value of `val` is assigned as the second element of the tuple `cur`. The initial state includes `HM is 51` and `cur` is the value at the front of the queue. Since the specific values of `cur` and the queue are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `val`. Therefore, the Output State is: `HM is 51`, `cur` is the value at the front of the queue, and `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`.
Output State: **`HM is 51`, `cur` is the value at the front of the queue, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`**
