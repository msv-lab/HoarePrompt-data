According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list nodes[ind]. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, HM is greater than val, nodes contains elements at index ind, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], cur is updated to the next element in the queue, val is updated accordingly, ind is assigned the next value in the queue, res[ind] is updated to val. If res[sosed] equals 0, then a new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in the list nodes[ind] needs to be considered. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Update sosed to the next element in nodes[ind]
- Update cur to the next element in the queue
- Update val accordingly

State: **HM is greater than val, nodes contains elements at index ind, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind], cur is updated to the next element in the queue, val is updated accordingly, ind is assigned the next value in the queue, res[ind] is updated to val. If res[sosed] equals 0, then a new list [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.**
