According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `sosed` and the list `nodes` indexed by `ind`. If there are more nodes to iterate over, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, HM is greater than val, res[sosed] is 0, cur holds the value popped from the queue, val is assigned the value from cur[1], ind is assigned the value of cur[0], and val is incremented by 1. After the if statement where val > HM, res[ind] is updated to val. Sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind. If res[sosed] is 0, [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **HM is greater than val, res[sosed] is 0, cur holds the value popped from the queue, val is assigned the value popped from cur[1], ind is assigned the value popped from cur[0], val is incremented by 1, res[ind] is updated, sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind, [sosed, val] is appended to the queue if res[sosed] is 0**
