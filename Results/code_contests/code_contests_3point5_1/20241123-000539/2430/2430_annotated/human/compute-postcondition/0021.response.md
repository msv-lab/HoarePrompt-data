Output State: **If HM is greater than val, the loop iterates through the elements in nodes[ind] and appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val, ind, and res are updated accordingly after each iteration. If the loop does not execute, the state remains the same as the initial state.**
