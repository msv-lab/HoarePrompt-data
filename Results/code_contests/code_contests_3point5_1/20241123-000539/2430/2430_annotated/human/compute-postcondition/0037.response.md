According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the conditions within the loop body. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were observed:
* HM is greater than val
* res[sosed] is 0
* cur holds the value popped from the queue
* val is assigned the value popped from cur[1]
* ind is assigned the value popped from cur[0]
* val is incremented by 1
* res[ind] is updated
* sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
* HM is greater than val
* res[sosed] is 0
* cur holds the value popped from the queue
* val is assigned the value popped from cur[1]
* ind is assigned the value popped from cur[0]
* val is incremented by 1
* res[ind] is updated
* sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind
* res[sosed] is 0

State: **HM is greater than val, res[sosed] is 0, cur holds the value popped from the queue, val is assigned the value popped from cur[1], ind is assigned the value popped from cur[0], val is incremented by 1, res[ind] is updated, sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind, res[sosed] is 0**
