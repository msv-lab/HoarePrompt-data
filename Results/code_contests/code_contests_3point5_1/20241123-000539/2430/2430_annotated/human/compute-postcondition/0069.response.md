According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and the length of the list `res`. If `ind` is less than the length of `res`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has a length greater than 0, `ind` is 1, and `res[ind]` is the first element in `res`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.
State: **HM is greater than or equal to val, the loop iterates through the elements in nodes[ind], appends a new list [sosed, val] to the queue if res[sosed] equals 0. The variables HM, nodes, sosed, cur, val is updated to the value of res[ind], ind is 2, and res is unchanged**
