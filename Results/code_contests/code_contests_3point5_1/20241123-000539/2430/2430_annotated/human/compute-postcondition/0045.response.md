Example Answer:
`ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`, which is the same as `cur[0]`. The value of `ind` is now equal to the first element popped from the queue. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue**
