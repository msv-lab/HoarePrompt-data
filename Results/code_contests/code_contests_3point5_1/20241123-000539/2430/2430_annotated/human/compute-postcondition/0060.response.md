According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nodes` and the elements in the list `nodes[ind]`. If there are still elements in the list `nodes[ind]`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, `res` is updated with the new value of `val` at index `ind`, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, and there are still elements in the list `nodes[ind]`. Additionally, if `res[sosed]` is 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `nodes[ind]` must still have elements, and the next element `sosed` needs to be considered.
State: **`cur` is modified, `val` is the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is the first element popped from the queue, `res` is updated with the new value of `val` at index `ind`, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, there are still elements in the list `nodes[ind]`, and if `res[sosed]` is 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue.**
