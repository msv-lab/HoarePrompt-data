According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `sosed` iterating over the nodes indexed by `ind`. At the end of the last iteration, HM is greater than val, res[sosed] is 0, cur holds the value popped from the queue, val is assigned the value popped from cur[1], ind is assigned the value popped from cur[0], val is incremented by 1, res[ind] is updated, sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind, res[sosed] is 0. If res[sosed] was initially 0, then the pair [sosed, val] is added to the queue. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted where sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind and res[sosed] is 0.
State: **HM is greater than val, res[sosed] is 0, cur holds the value popped from the queue, val is assigned the value popped from cur[1], ind is assigned the value popped from cur[0], val is incremented by 1, res[ind] is updated, sosed is a neighbor of the node indexed by ind, res[sosed] is 0, and res[sosed] was initially 0**.
