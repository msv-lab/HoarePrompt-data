According to the code, the loop will execute again for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `res` at index `sosed` should be 0.
2. `cur` should be the value popped from the front of the `queue`.
3. The value of `val` should be the second element of `cur` increased by 1.
4. `ind` should be assigned the value of the first element of `cur`.
5. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` should be appended to the `queue`.

All other variables and relationships should maintain their initial values.
State: **HM remains 51, `res` at index `ind` is incremented by 1, `nodes` at index `ind` has at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element in the list, `res` at index `sosed` is 0, `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur` increased by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
