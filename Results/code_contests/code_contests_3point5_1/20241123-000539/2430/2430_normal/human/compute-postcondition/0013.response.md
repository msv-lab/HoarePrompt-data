Postcondition: ***HM is 51. At the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1, where `val` is the second element of `cur` and `ind` is the first element of `cur`. `nodes[ind]` is a valid list, and `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`. If the value at index `sosed` of `res` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` list.***
