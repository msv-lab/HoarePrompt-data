Example Answer:
The value of `val` is assigned the second element of the list `cur`. The size of the list `cur` is unknown, so the value of `val` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown size, `val` is the second element of the list `cur`.
Output State: **HM is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown size, `val` is the second element of the list `cur`**
