Output State: **HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is `val + 2`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in the list. If the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. If the loop does not execute due to the initial conditions or any other case, all initial conditions are retained.**
