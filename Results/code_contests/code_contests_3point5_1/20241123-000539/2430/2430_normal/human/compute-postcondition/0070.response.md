Example Answer:
The variable `val` is assigned the value at index `ind` in the list `res`. The variables `queue`, HM, and `sosed` remain unchanged. Since `ind` is incremented to the next index, the value of `val` would depend on the new index in the list `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is not empty, HM remains 51, `res` list is not empty, `cur` and `ind` are incremented to the next index, `sosed` is updated according to the loop code, and `val` is assigned the value at the new index in the list `res`.
Output State: **`queue` is not empty, HM remains 51, `res` list is not empty, `cur` and `ind` are incremented to the next index, `sosed` is updated according to the loop code, and `val` is assigned the value at the new index in the list `res`**
