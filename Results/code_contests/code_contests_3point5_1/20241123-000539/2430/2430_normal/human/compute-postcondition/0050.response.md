According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one element in the list `nodes` at index `ind`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, the following adjustments need to be made to the initial state:
State: **HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is increased by 1, nodes at index `ind` has at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in the list, `res` at index `sosed` is 0, `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur` increased by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`.**
