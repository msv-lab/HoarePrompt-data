According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `ind` is less than the length of the list `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is not empty, HM remains 51, `res` list is not empty, `cur`, `ind`, `sosed` are updated according to the loop code, `ind` is 0, `val` is assigned the value at index `ind` in the list `res`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to the next index.
State: **`queue` is not empty, HM remains 51, `res` list is not empty, `cur`, `ind` is incremented to the next index, `sosed` is updated according to the loop code, `val` is assigned the value at the new index in the list `res`.**
