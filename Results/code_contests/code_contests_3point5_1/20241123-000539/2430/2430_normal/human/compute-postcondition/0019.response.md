Postcondition: ***HM is 51. At the new index specified by the updated `ind`, `res` is assigned the updated value of `val` + 1. `nodes[ind]` is a valid list, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`. If the value at index `sosed` of the updated `res` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` list.***
