Example Answer:
`ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `cur`, but the values of `cur` and `val` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown size, `val` is the second element of the list `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `cur`.
Output State: **HM is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown size, `val` is the second element of the list `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `cur`**
