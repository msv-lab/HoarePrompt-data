According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of the `res` list. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is not empty, HM remains 51, `res` list is not empty, `cur` is incremented to the next index, `ind` is incremented to the next index, `sosed` is updated according to the loop code, and `val` is assigned the value at the new index in the list `res`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to the next index, which means `ind` should be less than the new length of the `res` list after the increment.
State: **`queue` is not empty, HM remains 51, `res` list is not empty, `cur` is incremented to the next index, `ind` is less than the new length of `res`, `sosed` is updated according to the loop code, `val` is assigned the value at the new index in the list `res`**
