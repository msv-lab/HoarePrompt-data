Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, the program's state is as follows: HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is `val`, nodes at index `ind` remains unchanged with at least 1 element, `sosed` remains the first element in the list, the value of `res` at index `sosed` remains 0, `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`. If `val` is greater than HM, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables and relationships are maintained as described, with the additional condition of breaking out of the loop if `val` exceeds HM.***
