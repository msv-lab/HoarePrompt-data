According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `nodes` list at index `ind` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `res` at index `ind` is increased by 1, nodes at index `ind` has at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in the list, `res` at index `sosed` is 0, `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur` increased by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is increased by 1, nodes at index `ind` has at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element in the list, `res` at index `sosed` is 0, `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur` increased by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.
