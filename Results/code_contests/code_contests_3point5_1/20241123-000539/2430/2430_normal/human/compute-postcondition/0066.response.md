Postcondition: ***`queue` is not empty. HM remains 51. The `res` list has values updated at specific indices based on the conditions inside the loop. The loop continues until a condition is met that causes it to break. The variables `cur`, `val`, `ind`, `sosed` are updated according to the loop code. If the conditions for the if statement inside the loop are not met or if any lists are empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables maintain their initial values and relationships.***
