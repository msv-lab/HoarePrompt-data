Postcondition: ***HM remains 51. The value of `res` at index `ind` is incremented by 1, and `nodes` at index `ind` has at least 2 elements. The variable `sosed` is the second element in the list, and the `res` at index `sosed` is 0. The value of `cur` is popped from the front of the `queue`, and `val` is set to the second element of `cur` increased by 1. The `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`. If the initial value of `res[sosed]` was 0, then the pair `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.***
