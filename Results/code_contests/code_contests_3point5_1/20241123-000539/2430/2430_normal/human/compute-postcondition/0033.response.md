Postcondition: ***HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is `val + 2`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in the list, if the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. All initial conditions are retained, and the state of the program after the if block is executed is as described.***
