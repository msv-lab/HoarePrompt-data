Example Answer:
The value of `res` at index `ind` is assigned the value of `val`. The initial size of `res` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact state of `res` after this assignment. `val` is the second element of the list `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `cur`. 
Output State: **HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is assigned the value of `val`, `val` is the second element of the list `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `cur`**
