According to the code, the loop can execute again if the `queue` is not empty. After the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `HM` remains 51
- `res` at index `ind` is incremented by 1
- `nodes` at index `ind` has at least 1 element
- `sosed` is the first element in the list
- `res` at index `sosed` is 0
- `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`
- `val` is the second element of `cur` increased by 1
- `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`
- If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`

All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.

State: **HM remains 51, `res` at index `ind` is incremented by 1, `nodes` at index `ind` has at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in the list, `res` at index `sosed` is 0, `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur` increased by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`**
