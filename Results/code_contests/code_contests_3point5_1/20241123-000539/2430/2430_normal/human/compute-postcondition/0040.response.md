According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `nodes` at index `ind` and the value of `res` at index `sosed`. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `res` at index `new_ind` is `new_val`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 more element, `sosed` is the next element in the list, the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. Ensure that the next element in the list `nodes` at index `ind` is valid for iteration.
2. If the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` should be appended to the `queue`.

State: **HM is 51, `res` at index `new_ind` is `new_val`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 more element, `sosed` is the next element in the list, the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` if the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0.**
