Output State: 
*HM is 51. At the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1, where `val` is the second element of `cur` and `ind` is the first element of `cur`. If `val` is greater than 51, the program breaks out of the loop. The loop iterates through the elements of `nodes[ind]`, if the value at index `sosed` of `res` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` list. If `nodes[ind]` is an empty list or if the conditions for the `if` statement are not met, the loop does not execute.
If `nodes[ind]` is empty or if the conditions for the `if` statement are not met, the loop does not execute, and the variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
