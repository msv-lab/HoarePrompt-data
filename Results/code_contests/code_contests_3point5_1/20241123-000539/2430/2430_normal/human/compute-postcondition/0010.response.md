According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nodes` and `ind`. If `nodes[ind]` is a valid list, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is assigned the value of `val` + 1, `val` is the second element of the list `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `cur` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nodes[ind]` is a valid list and `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`.
State: **HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is assigned the value of `val` + 1, `val` is the second element of the list `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `cur`, `nodes[ind]` is a valid list, `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`**
