Output State: After the code executes, the program's state remains as follows: HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is increased by 1, nodes at index `ind` remains unchanged with at least 1 element, `sosed` remains the first element in the list, the value of `res` at index `sosed` remains 0, `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur` increased by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`. If the new value of `val` is greater than HM, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
