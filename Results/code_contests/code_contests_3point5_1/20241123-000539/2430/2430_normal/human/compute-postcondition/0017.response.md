According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list and the condition related to the value at index `sosed` of the updated `res`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given: HM is 51, at the new index specified by the updated `ind`, `res` is assigned the updated value of `val` + 1, `nodes[ind]` is a valid list, and `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`. If the value at index `sosed` of the updated `res` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` list.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `sosed` needs to be reassigned to the next element in the `nodes[ind]` list.
- If the value at index `sosed` of the updated `res` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` should be appended to the `queue` list.

State: **HM is 51, at the new index specified by the updated `ind`, `res` is assigned the updated value of `val` + 1, `nodes[ind]` is a valid list, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`. If the value at index `sosed` of the updated `res` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` list.**
