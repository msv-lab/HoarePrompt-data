According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nodes` at index `ind`. If there are more elements in the list at index `ind`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. The value of `sosed` should be updated to the next element in the list at index `ind`.
2. If the next element in the list at index `ind` exists, then the loop can execute again.
3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **HM remains 51. The value of `res` at index `ind` is incremented by 1, and `nodes` at index `ind` has at least 2 elements. The variable `sosed` is the next element in the list at index `ind`, and the `res` at index `sosed` is 0. The value of `cur` is popped from the front of the `queue`, and `val` is set to the second element of `cur` increased by 1. The `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`. If the initial value of `res[sosed]` was 0 and the next element exists in the list at index `ind`, then the pair `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
