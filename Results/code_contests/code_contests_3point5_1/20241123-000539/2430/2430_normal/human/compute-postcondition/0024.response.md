Example Answer:
The value of `val` is assigned the second element of the list `cur`, where `cur` is assumed to be a list. Since the initial state is not provided for `cur`, we can't determine the specific value of `val`. After the assignment, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1. Therefore, the output state is: HM is 51, and at the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1.
Output State: **HM is 51, and at the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1**
