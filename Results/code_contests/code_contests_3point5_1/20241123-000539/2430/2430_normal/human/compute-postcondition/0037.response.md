According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nodes` at index `ind` and the value of `res` at index `sosed`. If the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, then the loop executes again. 

At the end of the last iteration, HM is 51, `res` at index `new_ind` is `new_val`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 more element, `sosed` is the next element in the list. If the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `res` at index `sosed` must be 0 and `[sosed, val]` must be appended to the `queue`.
State: *HM is 51, `res` at index `new_ind` is `new_val`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 more element, `sosed` is the next element in the list, the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue*.
