Postcondition: ***If `queue` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values and relationships. If after the loop executes, `queue` is not empty, HM remains 51. The `res` list has values updated at specific indices based on the conditions inside the loop. The loop continues until a condition is met that causes it to break. The variables `cur`, `val`, `ind`, `sosed` are updated according to the loop code. If the conditions for the if statement inside the loop are not met or if any lists are empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables maintain their initial values and relationships. The program returns 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` is greater than HM. Otherwise, if any list is empty or the condition inside the loop is not met, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `queue` is not empty, HM remains 51, `res` list is not empty and has values updated based on the condition, `cur` is updated to the last index of `res`, `ind` is also updated to the last index of `res`, `sosed` is updated according to the loop code, and `val` is assigned the value at the last index in the list `res`.***
