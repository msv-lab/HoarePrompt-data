According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the list `nodes` at index `ind`. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `res` at index `ind` is `val + 2`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in the list, and if the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `ind` should be kept the same unless specified otherwise.
2. If there are more elements in the list `nodes` at index `ind` after the last iteration, then the state should reflect that. 
3. If the new `sosed` is the next element in the list `nodes` at index `ind`, then it should be updated accordingly.
4. If a new value of `res` is required to be calculated based on the new `sosed`, then it should be adjusted accordingly.
5. If the conditions for appending `[sosed, val]` to the `queue` are met, then this should be reflected in the state.

State: **HM is 51, `res` at index `new_ind` is `new_val`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 more element, `sosed` is the next element in the list, if the value of `res` at index `sosed` is 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`**
