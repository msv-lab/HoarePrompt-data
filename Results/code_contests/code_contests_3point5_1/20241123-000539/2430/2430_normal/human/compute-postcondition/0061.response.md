Output State: 
If the list `nodes` at index `ind` is empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values and relationships. 
After the loop executes, HM remains 51, `res` at index `ind` is incremented by 1, `nodes` at index `ind` has at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in the list, `res` at index `sosed` is 0, `cur` is the value popped from the front of the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur` increased by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. All other variables maintain their initial values and relationships.
