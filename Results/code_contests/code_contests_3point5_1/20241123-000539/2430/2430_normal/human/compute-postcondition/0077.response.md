Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. It initializes `HM` and creates a list `res` of size `n` filled with zeros. Then, it iterates through elements in `queue`, updating values in `res` based on specific conditions. If the maximum value in `res` exceeds the predetermined threshold `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, it updates certain values in `res` based on another condition. The function operates within a loop and handles various scenarios based on the contents of `queue`, `nodes`, and values in `res`.**
