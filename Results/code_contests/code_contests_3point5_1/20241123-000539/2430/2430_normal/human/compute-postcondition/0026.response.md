Example Answer:
`res` at index `ind` is assigned the value of `val`, which means `res` at index `ind` is now equal to `val`. The initial state indicates that `res` at index `ind` should be `val + 1`, so the new value at index `ind` should be `val + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51, and `res` at index `ind` is `val + 1`.
Output State: **HM is 51, and `res` at index `ind` is `val + 1`**
