According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes` list at index `ind`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, HM is 51 and `res` at index `ind` is `val + 2`. To ensure the loop executes, the `nodes` list at index `ind` should have at least 1 element, and `sosed` should be the first element in that list.
State: **HM is 51, `res` at index `ind` is `val + 2`, nodes at index `ind` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in the list**
