Example Answer: 
`cur` is assigned the value popped from the front of the `queue`. Since the initial state does not provide information about the contents of the `queue`, the specific value of `cur` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown size.
Output State: **HM is 51, `res` is a list of 0s of an unknown size**
