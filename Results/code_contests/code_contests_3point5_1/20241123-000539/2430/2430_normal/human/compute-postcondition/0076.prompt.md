You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Each pair of integers a and b in the n - 1 lines represents an undirected road between cities a and b, where 1 <= a, b <= n and a != b.**
```
def func_1(queue, n, nodes):
```
Output: *If `queue` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values and relationships. If after the loop executes, `queue` is not empty, HM remains 51. The `res` list has values updated at specific indices based on the conditions inside the loop. The loop continues until a condition is met that causes it to break. The variables `cur`, `val`, `ind`, `sosed` are updated according to the loop code. If the conditions for the if statement inside the loop are not met or if any lists are empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables maintain their initial values and relationships. The program returns 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` is greater than HM. Otherwise, if any list is empty or the condition inside the loop is not met, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `queue` is not empty, HM remains 51, `res` list is not empty and has values updated based on the condition, `cur` is updated to the last index of `res`, `ind` is also updated to the last index of `res`, `sosed` is updated according to the loop code, and `val` is assigned the value at the last index in the list `res`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
