Example Answer:
`ind` is assigned the value of the first element of list `cur`. Since `cur` is not provided in the initial state, the value of `ind` is unknown, so the output state is: HM is 51, and at the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1.
Output State: **HM is 51, and at the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1**
