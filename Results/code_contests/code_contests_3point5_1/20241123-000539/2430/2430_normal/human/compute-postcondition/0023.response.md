Example Answer: 
The first element of `cur` is assigned to `ind` and the second element of `cur` is assigned to `val`. Then, at the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1. The value of `HM` remains 51. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51. At the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1.
Output State: **HM is 51. At the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1**
