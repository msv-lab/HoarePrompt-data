According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `queue` list. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute once more. 
At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
Output State: *HM is 51. At the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1, where `val` is the second element of `cur` and `ind` is the first element of `cur`.
To execute the loop once more, the `queue` list must not be empty. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Output State: *HM is 51. At the index specified by `ind`, `res` is assigned the value of `val` + 1, where `val` is the second element of `cur` and `ind` is the first element of `cur`.**
