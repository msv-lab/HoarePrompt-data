Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The main issue lies in the function `func_1`. The function assigns ranks to the officers in such a way that if two officers have the same rank, there should be a higher-ranked officer on the path between them. However, the function does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if there are multiple paths between two officers of the same rank, the function may not ensure there is a higher-ranked officer on all those paths. This violates the special rule mentioned in the problem description.

Additionally, the output hints provided do not fully align with the code. The hints describe the function `func_1` correctly in terms of its inputs and general functionality, but they do not explicitly mention the requirement of ensuring a higher-ranked officer on all paths between officers of the same rank. This discrepancy further highlights the incorrectness of the code.
