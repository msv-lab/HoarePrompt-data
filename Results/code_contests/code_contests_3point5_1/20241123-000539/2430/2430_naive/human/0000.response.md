Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program is correctly implementing the problem description by assigning ranks to officers in such a way that the special rule is followed. It traverses the tree starting from leaf nodes and assigns ranks accordingly. The ranks are assigned in a way that ensures that there is always a higher rank officer on the path between two officers of the same rank. The logic of the program seems correct and it handles the given input format as well. Therefore, based on the provided examples and the logic of the program, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases.
