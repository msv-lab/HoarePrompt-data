Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a queue, the number of cities, and a list of nodes.
2. It initializes a list `res` to store the rank of officers for each city.
3. It iterates through the queue, assigning ranks to cities based on the rules provided in the problem description.
4. If the maximum rank assigned is greater than the maximum possible rank (2 * 26 - 1), it returns "Impossible!".
5. Otherwise, it converts the ranks to characters ('A' to 'Z') and returns the result as a space-separated string.
6. The program reads the input, constructs the tree structure, and calls the `func_1` function to assign ranks to cities.
7. The program prints either the assigned ranks or "Impossible!" based on the result of the function.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and handles the case of assigning ranks to cities in a valid way.
