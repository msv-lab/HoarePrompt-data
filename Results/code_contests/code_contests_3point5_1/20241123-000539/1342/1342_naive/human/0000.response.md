Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The program only considers the cases where the number is a prime number or can be split into two parts. However, the problem description states that the amount of tax to be paid should be the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n) and the number should be split into parts where each part is greater than or equal to 2. The program does not handle all possible cases where the number can be split into more than two parts to minimize the tax payment. 

For example, if the input is 27, the program will output 3, but the correct output should be 2 because 27 can be split into 9 + 9 + 9 or 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.
