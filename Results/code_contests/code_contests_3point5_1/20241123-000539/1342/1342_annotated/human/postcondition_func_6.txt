The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` such that n â‰¥ 2, and iterates through numbers from 2 up to the square root of n plus 100 to check if n is a prime number. If n is not a prime number and is divisible by any integer in that range, the function returns False. If n is a prime number or does not have any divisors in that range, the function returns True.
