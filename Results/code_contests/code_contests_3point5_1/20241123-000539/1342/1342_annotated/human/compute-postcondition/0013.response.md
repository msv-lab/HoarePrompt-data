The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`. **Precondition**: n is an integer such that n ≥ 2. 

If n is a prime number, the loop will not execute, and n will remain unchanged. If n is not a prime number, the loop will check divisibility by integers from 2 up to the square root of n plus 100. If n is divisible by any of these integers and n is not equal to that integer, the function will return False. If n is not divisible by any of these integers, the function will not return anything and the loop will terminate.

If n is a prime number or if the loop does not find any divisors for n, the function will return True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` such that n ≥ 2, and return False if n is not a prime number and is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of n plus 100. If n is a prime number or does not have any divisors in that range, the function returns True.
