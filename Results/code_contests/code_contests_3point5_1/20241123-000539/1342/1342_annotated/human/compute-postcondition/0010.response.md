According to the code, the loop continues until `i` reaches the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2 and `i` is the next integer after 3 within the range of 2 to n. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, then the program returns False. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of `n` and `i`.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the current `i` within the range of 2 to n. If the condition for returning False is not met, then `i` should be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2 and `i` is the next integer after the current `i` within the range of 2 to n**
