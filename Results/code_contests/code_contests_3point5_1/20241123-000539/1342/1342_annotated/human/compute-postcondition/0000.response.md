According to the code, the loop will execute if the range provided has at least one valid integer value. In this case, the loop will execute if n is at least 2, as given by the precondition. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2 and `i` is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `i` is 2**
