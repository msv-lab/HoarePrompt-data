Output State: **If n is a prime number, the loop will not execute, and n will remain unchanged. If n is not a prime number, the loop will check divisibility by integers from 2 up to the square root of n plus 100. If n is divisible by any of these integers and n is not equal to that integer, the function will return False. If n is not divisible by any of these integers, the function will not return anything and the loop will terminate.**
