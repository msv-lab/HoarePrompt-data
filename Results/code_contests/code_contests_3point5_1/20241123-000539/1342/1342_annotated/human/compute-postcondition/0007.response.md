According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 2 to the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2 and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after 3 within the specified range.
State: **`n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2 and `i` is the next integer after 3 within the range of 2 to int(n ** 0.5 + 100)**
