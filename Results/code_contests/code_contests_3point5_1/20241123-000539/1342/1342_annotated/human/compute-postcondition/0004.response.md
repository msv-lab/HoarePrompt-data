According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `i` is 3**
