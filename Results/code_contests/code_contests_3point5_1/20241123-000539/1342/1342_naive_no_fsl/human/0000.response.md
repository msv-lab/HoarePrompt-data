Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program only considers a few specific cases and does not cover all possible scenarios as required by the problem description. For example, if we input 9, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the minimum tax amount should be calculated based on the maximum divisor of n, which in this case would be 3 (not 2). Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases.
