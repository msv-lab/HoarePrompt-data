Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It first checks if the input number is a prime number using the `func_7` function. If it is a prime number, it prints 1 as the minimum tax amount. If the number is not prime, it checks if the number is even, in which case it prints 2 as the minimum tax amount. If the number is not prime and not even, it subtracts 2 from the number and checks if the result is a prime number using `func_7` again. If it is a prime number, it prints 2 as the minimum tax amount. Otherwise, it prints 3 as the minimum tax amount. 

The code handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The output hints also align with the code's logic and there are no contradictions between the code and the hints. Therefore, based on the alignment between the code, the problem description, and the output hints, the correctness of the program is **True**.
