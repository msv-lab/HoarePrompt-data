According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4. Since `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100, the loop will execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4**
