The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is a prime number, the loop does not execute, and there are no changes to the variables `n` and `i`. If `n` is not a prime number, the loop will iterate through values of `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus 100. If at any point `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `n` and `i`.

If the loop completes without finding a divisor for `n`, the function returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` greater than or equal to 2 and determine if it is a prime number. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns True. If `n` is not a prime number, the function returns False.
