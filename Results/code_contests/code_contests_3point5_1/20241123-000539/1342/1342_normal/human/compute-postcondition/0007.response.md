According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 3. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` to the next value. Since `i` is currently 3, the next value for `i` should be 4.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 4**
