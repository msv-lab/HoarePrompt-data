Functionality: **The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` greater than or equal to 2. It iterates through values of `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus 100. If `n` is a prime number, the loop does not execute, and the function returns True. If `n` is not a prime number, and it is divisible by any `i` where `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.**
