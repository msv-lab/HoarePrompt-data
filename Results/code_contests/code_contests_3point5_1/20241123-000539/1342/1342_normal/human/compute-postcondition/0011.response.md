Output State: **If `n` is a prime number, the loop does not execute and there are no changes to the variables `n` and `i`. If `n` is not a prime number, the loop will iterate through values of `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus 100. If at any point `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `n` and `i`.**
