According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range provided has at least one element. The range starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of `n` plus 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the range must have at least one element. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2.
State: **`Precondition`: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
