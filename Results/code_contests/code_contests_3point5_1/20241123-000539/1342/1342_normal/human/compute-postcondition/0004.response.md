According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. Since the loop needs to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 (one more than the previous value).
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
