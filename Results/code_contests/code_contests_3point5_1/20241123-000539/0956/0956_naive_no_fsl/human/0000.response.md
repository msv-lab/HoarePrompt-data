Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, and the string itself. It then checks if it is possible to partition the string into subsequences of TMT by using two deques to keep track of the indices of 'T' and 'M' characters. The program then iterates through the deques to check if the partition is possible based on the given conditions.

The program outputs 'YES' if the partition is possible and 'NO' otherwise. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all the cases as specified. Hence, the code is correct.
