According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of deque `t` and `m`. If the length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list with the leftmost elements of deque 'm' at the corresponding indices; length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'. If the length of deque `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and 'poss' remains the same; `arr` remains a list of zeros with half the length of deque `t`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of deque `t` should still be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list with the leftmost elements of deque 'm' at the corresponding indices; length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'. If the length of deque `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and 'poss' remains the same; `arr` remains a list of zeros with half the length of deque `t`.**
