According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of deque `t`. At the end of the last iteration, 'poss' reflects the new comparison between the next elements of deques 't' and 'm'. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value, which is the current value of `i` plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects the new comparison between the next elements of deques 't' and 'm'; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, the rest of the state remains the same**
