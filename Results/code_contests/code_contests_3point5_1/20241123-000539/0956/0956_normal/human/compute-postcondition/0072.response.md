Example Answer: 
The value at index `i` in list `arr` is assigned the value of the leftmost element popped from deque `m`. Since the length of deque `m` is multiplied by 2 and is equal to the length of deque `t`, and the length of `arr` is `t` divided by 2, and `t` is greater than or equal to 2, this operation is valid. The state of `poss` is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques `t` and `m`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list with the leftmost element of deque 'm' at index `i`, length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'.
Output State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list with the leftmost element of deque 'm' at index `i`, length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'**
