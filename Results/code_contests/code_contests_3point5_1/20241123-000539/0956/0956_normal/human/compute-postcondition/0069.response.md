Example Answer:
The list `arr` is created with a length of half of the length of deque `t` filled with zeros. Since 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't', the length of `arr` is half the length of deque `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: *After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list of zeros with half the length of deque `t`.
Output State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list of zeros with half the length of deque `t`**
