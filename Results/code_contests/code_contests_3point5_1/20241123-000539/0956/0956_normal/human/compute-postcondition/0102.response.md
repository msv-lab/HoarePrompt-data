According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a deque containing 0 if the first character in `s` is 'T', otherwise `m` contains 0. In all cases, `i` is 0 and `si` is the first character in `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `si` needs to be retrieved from the string `s`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to represent the next index in the string.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a deque containing 0 if the first character in `s` is 'T', otherwise `m` contains 0. In all cases, `i` is 1 and `si` is the second character in `s`.**
