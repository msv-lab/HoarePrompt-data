According to the code, the loop will execute for each index in the `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next index in `arr` needs to be considered. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `poss` is false, `arr` is populated with the indices of non-'T' characters, `i` is the index of the loop iteration, and `len(t)` is at least 2, `poss` is false. For the loop to execute one more time, the next index in `arr` needs to be considered, so `i` should be updated to the next index in `arr`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `poss` is false, `arr` is populated with the indices of non-'T' characters, `i` is the next index in `arr`, and `len(t)` is at least 2, `poss` is false**
