Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `sep`, so we cannot determine the exact output. Therefore, the Output State is: *t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, at_start is False, args is a non-empty list*.
Output State: ***t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, at_start is False, args is a non-empty list***
