Example Answer:
`arr` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of half the number of indices in `t`. The length of `t` is the number of 'T' characters in `s`, so `arr` will have a length of half the number of 'T' characters. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length of half the number of 'T' characters in `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length of half the number of 'T' characters in `s`**
