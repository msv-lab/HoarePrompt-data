Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in array `arr` is assigned the value of the element removed from the left side of deque `m`. The comparison between the next elements of deques `t` and `m` reflected by `poss` might change based on the new values of deques `t` and `m`. The rest of the state remains the same.
Output State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects the new comparison between the next elements of deques 't' and 'm'; the rest of the state remains the same.**
