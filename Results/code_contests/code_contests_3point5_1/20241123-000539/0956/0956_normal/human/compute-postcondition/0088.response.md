Output State: After the execution, 'poss' reflects the comparison between the elements of deques 't' and 'm'; `arr` is updated with the leftmost elements of deque 'm' at the corresponding indices; length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2. If the length of deque `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and 'poss' remains the same; `arr` remains a list of zeros with half the length of deque `t`.
