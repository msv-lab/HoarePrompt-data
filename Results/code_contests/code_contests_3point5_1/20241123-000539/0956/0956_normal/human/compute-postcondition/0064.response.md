Postcondition: ***'t-1' and 'm' are deques containing the actual indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters in the string 's', 'n' is an input integer, 's' is a non-empty string, 'poss' reflects the logical AND of all comparisons, 'arr' is empty, 'i' is the next index value, 'len(t)' is at least 2, 'n' is an input integer, 's' contains the input string, 't' is a deque with at least 2 elements, 'm' is a deque with actual indices where the last element includes the updated 'i', 'poss' reflects correct logical comparisons based on the loop body. Depending on the value of 'si', the next index 'i' is appended to deque 't' if 'si' is 'T' or to deque 'm' if 'si' is not 'T'. This ensures that 't-1' and 'm' are updated accordingly based on the character 'si' in string 's' for the next iteration, maintaining the integrity of the deques and other variables for the following loop iteration.***
