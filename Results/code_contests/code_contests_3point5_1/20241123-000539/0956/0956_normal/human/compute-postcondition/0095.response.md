Example Answer:
`m` is assigned an empty deque. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string containing the input value, `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string containing the input value, `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque**
