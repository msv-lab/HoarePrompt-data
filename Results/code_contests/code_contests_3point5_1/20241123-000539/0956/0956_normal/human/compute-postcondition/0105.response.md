Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a deque containing 0 if the first character in `s` is 'T', otherwise `m` contains 0, `i` is 1, `si` is the second character in `s`. If the second character in `s` is 'T', then 1 is appended to deque `t`. Otherwise, 1 is appended to deque `m`.***
