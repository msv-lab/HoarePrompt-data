According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to enumerate. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains 0 if the first character in `s` is 'T', otherwise `m` contains 0, `i` is 1, and `si` is the second character in `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the string `s` needs to be accessed. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to represent the index of the next character in `s`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains 0 if the first character in `s` is 'T', otherwise `m` contains 0, `i` is 2, `si` is the third character in `s`**
