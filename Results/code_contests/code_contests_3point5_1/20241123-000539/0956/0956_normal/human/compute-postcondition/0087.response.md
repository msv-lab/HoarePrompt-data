According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `arr` list. If there are still elements in `arr`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. 'poss' needs to be updated based on the next comparison between the elements of deques 't' and 'm'.
2. `arr` needs to be updated with the next leftmost elements of deque 'm' at the corresponding indices.
3. The length of `t` divided by 2.
4. The length of deque `t` needs to be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:
State: **'poss' is updated based on the next comparison between the elements of deques 't' and 'm'; `arr` is updated with the next leftmost elements of deque 'm' at the corresponding indices; length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2**
