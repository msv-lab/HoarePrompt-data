According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the length of deque `t` and `m` should be considered to determine if the loop can execute. If the length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, then 'poss' is updated and 'arr' is populated accordingly. If the length of deque `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the state that needs to be adjusted is the length of deque `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects the comparison between the elements of deques 't' and 'm'. If the length of deque 't' is greater than or equal to 2, 'poss' is updated based on the comparison of elements from deques 't' and 'm'. The list 'arr' is populated with elements from deque 'm' at corresponding indices, and the length of 'arr' is equal to half the length of deque 't'. If the length of deque 't' is less than 2, the loop does not execute, leaving 'poss' unchanged, and 'arr' remains a list of zeros with half the length of deque 't'. Then, the function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'.**
