According to the code, the loop will execute 't' number of times. At the end of the previous iteration, 't', 'm' are deques containing the indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters in the string 's', 'n' is an input integer, 's' is a non-empty string, 'poss' reflects the logical AND of all comparisons, 'arr' is empty, 'i' is the next index to iterate over (if any), 'len(t)' remains at least 2.

To execute the loop one more time, the 't' value needs to be decremented by 1 and at least 2 indices of 'T' characters should remain in the deque 't'.
State: **'t-1', 'm' are deques containing the indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters in the string 's', 'n' is an input integer, 's' is a non-empty string, 'poss' reflects the logical AND of all comparisons, 'arr' is empty, 'i' is the next index to iterate over (if any), 'len(t)' remains at least 2**
