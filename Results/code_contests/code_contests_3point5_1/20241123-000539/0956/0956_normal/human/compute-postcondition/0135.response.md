Output State: **After the if block executes, if `poss` is True, the loop will execute if `t` has at least 2 indices and `m` is not empty. After the loop completes, `t` will have at least 2 indices, `m` will have the first index removed, `n` will still be an input integer, `s` will remain a non-empty string, `t` will contain the indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `poss` will be False, `arr` will have elements less than the length of `t`, `i` will represent the number of iterations completed, and `poss` will be False in all cases. Then the function `func_2` will be called with an argument of 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'.**
