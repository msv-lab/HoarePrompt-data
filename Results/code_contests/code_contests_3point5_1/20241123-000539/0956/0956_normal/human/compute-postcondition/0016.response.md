Postcondition: ***`x` is the next string value in `args`, `at_start` is True if it is the start of the loop, otherwise False. If `at_start` is False, then `file` writes `sep`. In all cases, the state of the program variables remains consistent with the initial precondition, ensuring that the values of `x` and `at_start` are maintained throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
