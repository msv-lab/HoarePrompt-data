According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `poss` is false, `arr` has the value of `m.popleft()` at index `i`, `i` is 0, and `len(t)` is at least 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented by 1. 
- The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than half the length of `t`, so the `i` value needs to be less than `(len(t) // 2) + 1`.

State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `poss` is false, `arr` has the value of `m.popleft()` at index `i`, `i` is 1, and `len(t)` is at least 2**
