According to the code, the loop can execute based on the elements in the `args` list. Since no specific conditions are mentioned, we can assume that as long as `args` has at least one element, the loop will execute. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, at_start is True, args is a non-empty list**
