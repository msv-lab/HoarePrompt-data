Example Answer: 
The value of 'poss' is updated by performing the comparison between the first element of deque 't' (after removing it) and the first element of deque 'm'. If the comparison result is True, 'poss' remains True; otherwise, it becomes False. The rest of the state remains the same.
Output State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects the comparison between the next elements of deques 't' and 'm'; the rest of the state remains the same.**
