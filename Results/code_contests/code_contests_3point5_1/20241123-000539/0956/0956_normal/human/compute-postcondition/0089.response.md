Postcondition: ***After the execution, 'poss' reflects the comparison between the elements of deques 't' and 'm'. If the length of deque 't' is greater than or equal to 2, 'poss' is updated based on the comparison of elements from deques 't' and 'm'. The list 'arr' is populated with elements from deque 'm' at corresponding indices, and the length of 'arr' is equal to half the length of deque 't'. If the length of deque 't' is less than 2, the loop does not execute, leaving 'poss' unchanged, and 'arr' remains a list of zeros with half the length of deque 't'.***
