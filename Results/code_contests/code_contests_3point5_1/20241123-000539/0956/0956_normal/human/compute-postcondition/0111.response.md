Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`. The loop will always execute and go through each character in `s`, appending the index to either `t` or `m` based on the character at that index. If `s` is empty, both `t` and `m` will remain empty.**
