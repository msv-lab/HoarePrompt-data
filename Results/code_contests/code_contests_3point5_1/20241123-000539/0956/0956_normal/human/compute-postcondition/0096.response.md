According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the string `s` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be an empty string. At the start of the loop, `t` is an empty deque and `m` is an empty deque. Since the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`, the index `i` will start from 0, and `si` will be the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character in `s`**
