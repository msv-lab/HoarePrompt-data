According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of deque `t`. If the length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't', `arr` is a list with the leftmost elements of deque 'm' at the corresponding indices, length of `t` divided by 2, length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Update 'poss' based on the comparison between the next elements of deques 't' and 'm'.
2. Update `arr` to include the next leftmost elements of deque `m` at the corresponding indices.
3. Update the 'poss' state based on the updated comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'.
State: **Output State: 'poss' is updated based on the next comparison between the elements of deques 't' and 'm'; `arr` is updated with the next leftmost elements of deque 'm' at the corresponding indices; length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2**
