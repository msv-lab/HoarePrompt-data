According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least 2 indices, `m` is not empty, and `poss` is True. For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs adjustment is the value of `t` which should be greater than 1.
State: **After the if block executes, if `poss` is True, `t` has at least 2 indices, `m` is not empty. After the loop completes, `t` has at least 2 indices, `m` has the first index removed, `n` is still an input integer, `s` remains a non-empty string, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` has elements less than the length of `t`, `i` represents the number of iterations completed, and `poss` is False in all cases. Then the function `func_2` will be called with an argument of 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'.**
