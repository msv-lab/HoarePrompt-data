According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the index `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 1 index of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `poss` is false, `arr` has the value of `m.popleft()` at index `i`, `i` is 4, and `len(t)` is at least 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the condition for the loop to execute needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than half the length of `t` plus 1.
State: **`t` contains at least 1 index of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `poss` is false, `arr` has the value of `m.popleft()` at index `i`, `i` is 5, and `len(t)` is at least 2**
