Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains 0 if the first character in `s` is 'T', otherwise `m` contains 0, `i` is 2, `si` is the third character in `s`. If the third character in `s` is 'T', `t` is appended with 2. Otherwise, `m` is appended with 2 and `m` is now a list containing [2].***
