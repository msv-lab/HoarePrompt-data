Output State: **If `t` has less than 2 indices or `m` is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `t` has at least 2 indices, `m` is not empty, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters in `s` with the first index removed, `poss` is False, `arr` has elements less than the length of `t`, `i` is the number of iterations completed, and `poss` is False**
