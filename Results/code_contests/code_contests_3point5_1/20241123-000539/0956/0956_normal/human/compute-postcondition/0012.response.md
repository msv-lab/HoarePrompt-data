Example Answer:
The code snippet writes the string value of `x` to the file. Since `at_start` is False, the string value of `x` will be written to the file. The initial state does not specify the value of `x`, so the output state will include the updated value of `x` written to the file.
Output State: **The file now contains the string value of `x`**
