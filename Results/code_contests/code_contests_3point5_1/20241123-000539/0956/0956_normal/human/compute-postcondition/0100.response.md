Example Answer:
`i` is appended to deque `m`, and `i` is 0, so after execution, `m` contains [0]. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is an empty deque, `m` contains [0], `i` is 0, `si` is the first character in `s`, and the first character in `s` is not 'T'.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is an empty deque, `m` contains [0], `i` is 0, `si` is the first character in `s`, and the first character in `s` is not 'T'**
