Postcondition: ***'t', 'm' are deques containing the indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters in the string 's', 'n' is an input integer, 's' is a non-empty string, and 'poss' is a boolean value indicating whether the number of non-'T' characters in 's' is half the number of 'T' characters in 's'. If there are at least 2 'T' characters in 's', the loop iterates over the indices of non-'T' characters stored in 'arr'. During each iteration, the loop checks if the current index is less than the corresponding index of 'T' characters stored in 't', updating the 'poss' variable accordingly. After the loop executes, 't' contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, 'm' retains the indices of non-'T' characters, 'poss' reflects the logical AND of all comparisons, 'arr' is empty, 'i' is the next index to iterate over (if any), and 'len(t)' remains at least 2. If the number of 'T' characters is less than 2, the loop does not execute, 'poss' is false, and the 'arr' deque is not modified.***
