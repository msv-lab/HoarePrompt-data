According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of deque `t`. If the length of deque `t` is such that dividing by 2 results in a non-zero value, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list with the leftmost element of deque 'm' at index `i + 1`, length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'. 

To execute one more time, 'poss' needs to be adjusted based on the comparison between the next elements of deques 't' and 'm'. 
State: **Output State: After the execution, 'poss' reflects the comparison between the next elements of deques 't' and 'm'; the rest of the state remains the same.**
