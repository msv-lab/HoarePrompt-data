According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more indices in the `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `poss` is false, `arr` is populated with the indices of non-'T' characters, `i` is the next index in `arr`, `len(t)` is at least 2, `poss` is false, and `arr` still has more indices to iterate over, and `poss` is false. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the next index `i` in `arr` should be updated to the next index after the current one.
State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `poss` is false, `arr` is populated with the indices of non-'T' characters, `i` is the next index in `arr` after the current one, `len(t)` is at least 2, `poss` is false, and `arr` still has more indices to iterate over**
