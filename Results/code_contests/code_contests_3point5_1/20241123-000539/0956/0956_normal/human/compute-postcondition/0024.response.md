Postcondition: ***If `args` is a non-empty list, after the loop executes, `x` is the last string value in `args`, `at_start` is False, and the file has been written with the string representation of `x`. If `args` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True. In either case, if `kwargs` originally had the key 'flush', it is removed. Otherwise, `kwargs` remains unchanged.***
