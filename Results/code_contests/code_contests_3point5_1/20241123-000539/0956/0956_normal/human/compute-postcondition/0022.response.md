Postcondition: ***args is a non-empty list. After the loop executes, x is the last string value in args, at_start is False, and the file has been written with the string representation of x. If args is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and at_start remains True. kwargs has 'flush' key removed if it exists, otherwise, no change in kwargs.***
