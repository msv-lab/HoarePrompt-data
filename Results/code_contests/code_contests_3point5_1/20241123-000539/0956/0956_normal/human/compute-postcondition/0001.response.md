Example Answer:
The code snippet does not affect the variables t and n. The variables kwargs, sep, file, and sys are introduced, but their values are not specified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3. 
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3**
