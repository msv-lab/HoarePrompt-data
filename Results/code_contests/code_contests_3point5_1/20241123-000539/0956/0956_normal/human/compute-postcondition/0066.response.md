Output State: **After the loop executes, 't-1' and 'm' are deques containing the actual indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters in the string 's', 'n' is an input integer, 's' is a non-empty string, 'poss' reflects the logical AND of all comparisons, 'arr' is empty, 'i' is the next index value if there are more elements in 's', 'len(t)' is at least 2, 'n' is an input integer, 's' contains the input string, 't' is a deque with at least 2 elements, 'm' is a deque with actual indices, 'poss' reflects correct logical comparisons based on the loop body. If 'si' is 'T', the index 'i' is appended to 't'. If 'si' is not 'T', the index 'i' is appended to 'm'. This covers all edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if else block executes. If 's' is empty, the loop does not execute and 't' and 'm' remain empty deques.**
