Output State: **If `t` has less than 2 indices or `m` is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters in `s` with length at least 2, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters in `s` with the first index removed, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length of half the number of 'T' characters in `s` with the first index of non-'T' character added to it, and `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed.**
