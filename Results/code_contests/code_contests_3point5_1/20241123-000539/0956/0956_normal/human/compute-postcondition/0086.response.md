Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is compared to the leftmost element of deque `t` after removing it. If `i` is less than the removed element, `poss` is updated to False. The previous state of `poss` is unknown, and the elements of deques `t` and `m` are also unknown. Therefore, the output state is: Output State: **'poss' is updated based on the next comparison between the elements of deques 't' and 'm'; `arr` is updated with the next leftmost elements of deque 'm' at the corresponding indices; length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2**
