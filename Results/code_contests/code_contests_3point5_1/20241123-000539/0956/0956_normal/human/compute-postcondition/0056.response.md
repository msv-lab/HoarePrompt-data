Postcondition: ***'t-1' and 'm' are deques containing the actual indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters in the string 's', 'n' is an input integer, 's' is a non-empty string, 'poss' reflects the logical AND of all comparisons, 'arr' is empty, 'i' is 0, 'len(t)' is at least 2, 'n' is an input integer, 's' contains the input string, 't' is a deque with at least 2 elements, 'm' is a deque with actual indices where the last element includes 'i', 'poss' reflects correct logical comparisons based on the loop body. If 'si' is 'T', the index 'i' is appended to 't'. If 'si' is not 'T', the index 'i' is appended to 'm'. This covers all edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if else block executes.***
