According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `poss` is false, `arr` has the value of `m.popleft()` at index `i`, `i` is 2, and `len(t)` is at least 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `poss` is false, `arr` has the value of `m.popleft()` at index `i`, `i` is 3, and `len(t)` is at least 2, and `poss` is false**
