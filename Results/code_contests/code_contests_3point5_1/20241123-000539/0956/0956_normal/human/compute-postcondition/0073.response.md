According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of deque `t` divided by 2. At the end of the last iteration, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't', `arr` is a list with the leftmost element of deque 'm' at index `i`, length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `arr` should be updated to have the leftmost element of deque 'm' at index `i+1`. No other states need adjustment.

State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list with the leftmost element of deque 'm' at index `i + 1`, length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'**
