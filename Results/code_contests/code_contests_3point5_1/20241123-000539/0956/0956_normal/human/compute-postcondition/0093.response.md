Example Answer:
The input value is stored in variable `s` using the `input()` function. The variable `n` is an input integer, and it's not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string containing the input value.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string containing the input value**
