Example Answer:
The value of 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'. If the first element of deque 't' is less than the first element of deque 'm', 'poss' will be True, otherwise, it will be False. The lengths and contents of the deques are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list with the leftmost element of deque 'm' at index `i + 1`, length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'.
Output State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list with the leftmost element of deque 'm' at index `i + 1`, length of `t` divided by 2; length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'poss' is updated based on the comparison between the first elements of deques 't' and 'm'**
