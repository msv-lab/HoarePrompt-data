Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the file. The previous value of `x` is the next string value in `args`, and `at_start` is True if it is the start of the loop, otherwise False. The statement `file.write(sep)` does not affect the values of `x` and `at_start`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the next string value in `args`, `at_start` is True if it is the start of the loop, otherwise False.
Output State: **`x` is the next string value in `args`, `at_start` is True if it is the start of the loop, otherwise False**
