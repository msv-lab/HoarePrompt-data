According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `args`. If there are more values in `args` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a string value, `at_start` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `x` should be considered, and `at_start` should be updated accordingly based on whether it is the start of the loop or not.
State: **`x` is the next string value in `args`, `at_start` is True if it is the start of the loop, otherwise False**
