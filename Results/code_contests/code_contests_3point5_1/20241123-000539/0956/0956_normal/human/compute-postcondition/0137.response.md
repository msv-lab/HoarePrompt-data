Output State: **If 't' is at least 1, then after the loop executes, 't' will contain the number of test cases, 'm' and 't' will be deques containing the indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters in the string 's', 'n' will be an input integer, 's' will be a non-empty string, 'poss' will reflect whether there is an equal number of 'T' and non-'T' characters, 'arr' will be a list of zeroes with a length equal to half the size of 't', 'i' will represent the number of iterations completed. If 't' is less than 1, the loop won't execute and 't', 'm', 'n', 's', 'poss', 'arr', and 'i' will retain their initial values.**
