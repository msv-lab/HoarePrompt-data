According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of deque `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, 'poss' reflects the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't' does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect that the length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2. Also, since `arr` is a list of zeros with half the length of deque `t`, it should be adjusted to `arr` is a list of zeros with length of `t` divided by 2. Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:
State: **After the execution, 'poss' reflects that the length of deque 'm' multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque 't'; `arr` is a list of zeros with length of `t` divided by 2, length of deque `t` is greater than or equal to 2**
