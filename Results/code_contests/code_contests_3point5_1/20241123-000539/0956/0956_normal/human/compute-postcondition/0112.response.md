Example Answer: 
The boolean variable `poss` is assigned the result of the comparison len(m) * 2 == len(t). This checks if the number of indices of non-'T' characters in `s` multiplied by 2 is equal to the number of indices of 'T' characters in `s`. If the condition is met, `poss` will be True, otherwise, it will be False. The other variables `n`, `s`, `t`, and `m` are not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `poss` is either True or False**
