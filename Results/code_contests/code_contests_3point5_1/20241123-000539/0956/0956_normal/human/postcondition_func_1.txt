The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It iterates through the `args` list, writing each element to the output stream specified by the `file` argument. If `args` is empty, nothing is written. The function then writes the value specified by the 'end' key in `kwargs` to the output stream, defaulting to a newline. If the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs` with a truthy value, the output stream is flushed. The function does not explicitly return any value.
