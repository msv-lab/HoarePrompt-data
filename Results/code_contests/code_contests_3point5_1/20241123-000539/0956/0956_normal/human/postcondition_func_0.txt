The function `func_1` reads input values, processes them based on the conditions specified in the code, and calls another function `func_2` with either 'YES' or 'NO' as an argument. It iterates over the input test cases, checks for the equality of 'T' and non-'T' characters in the input string, and modifies the state of various variables accordingly. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
