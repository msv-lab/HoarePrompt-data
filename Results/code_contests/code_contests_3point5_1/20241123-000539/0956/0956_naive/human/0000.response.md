Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input, processes each test case, and determines whether the given string can be partitioned into subsequences equal to TMT. It checks if the number of 'M's is half of the number of 'T's, and then creates arrays to keep track of the positions of 'T's and 'M's. It then verifies if the positions meet the required conditions for partitioning. The output is 'YES' if the partition exists and 'NO' otherwise. The logic of the program seems to correctly address the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
