According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `t` divided by 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `t` divided by 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be the next index after the last iteration, which is the current value of `i` plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a deque containing indices of elements in `s` that are 'T' with length at least 1, `m` is a deque containing indices of elements in `s` that are not 'T' with one element removed, `s` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the next element in `s` (current `i` value + 1), `si` is the next element in `s`, `poss` is false, `arr` is a list filled with zeros with a length that is the integer division of the length of `t` by 2 where `arr[i]` is assigned the value popped from `m`, `poss` is false, `i` is less than the length of `t` divided by 2, `poss` is false if the index of the first element in `t` is less than the index of the first element in `m`**
