Example Answer:
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the value of `sep` to the output. The value of `sep` is ' ', so a space is written to the output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the default value ' ', `file` is assigned the default value sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the default value ' ', `file` is assigned the default value sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element**
