According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the deque `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `poss` can be either true or false, `i` is assigned the first element in `arr`, the length of `t` is at least 1, and the length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `arr` needs to be accessed. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be assigned the next element in `arr`.
State: **`poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, length of `m` is greater than or equal to length of `t`**
