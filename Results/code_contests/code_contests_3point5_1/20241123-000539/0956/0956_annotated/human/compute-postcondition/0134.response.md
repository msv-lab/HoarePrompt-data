Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque with indices of elements in `s` that are 'T', `m` is a deque with the last index of `s` when `si` is not equal to 'T', `s` is an iterable with at least `i+1` elements, and `poss` is a boolean representing whether the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`. After the if block executes, `t` might be empty before the loop finishes, `m` is updated, `s` still has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` contains elements updated up to more than half the length of the original `t`, and `i` is less than the value removed from the left of `t`. If `t` is empty before the loop finishes, then `poss` will be based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()` and the loop does not execute. Edge cases are handled to ensure the program maintains the necessary relationships between `t`, `m`, and `poss` throughout the execution.***
