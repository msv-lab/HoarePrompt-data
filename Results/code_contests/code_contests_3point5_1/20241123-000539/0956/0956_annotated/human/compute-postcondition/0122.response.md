Example Answer:
The value popped from `t` is compared to the first element of `m`. If the comparison is true, `poss` retains its previous value (true or false). If the comparison is false, `poss` becomes false. The length of `t` decreases by 1, and `m` remains unchanged. The length of `s` remains unchanged, and the list `arr` has an element updated at index `i+1`.
Output State: **`t` has a length of at least 1, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` still has at least `i+2` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list with an element updated at index `i+1`**
