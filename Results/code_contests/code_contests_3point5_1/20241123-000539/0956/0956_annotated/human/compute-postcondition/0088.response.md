Output State: **If the length of `t` is less than 2, or if the first element in `t` is not less than the first element in `m`, then the loop won't execute and `poss` will remain as it was before the loop. If the length of `m` is less than the length of `t`, the loop will only iterate for the length of `m`. After the loop executes, `poss` will be either true or false, `i` will be assigned the last element in `arr`, length of `t` will be at least 1, and the length of `m` will be greater than or equal to the length of `t`.**
