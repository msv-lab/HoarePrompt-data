Output State: **`t`, `m` are deques, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the index of the last element in `s`, `si` is the last element in `s`, `poss` is True if the last element in `s` is 'T' and False otherwise, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length of half the size of `t`, length of `t` is at least 2, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison result of the popped element from deque `t` and the first element of deque `m`. `arr[i]` is assigned the value popped from deque `m`.**
