According to the code, the loop can execute as long as arr has elements. Before the loop starts, `t` might become empty before the loop finishes, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is not empty. `m` will be updated accordingly, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect the updated value of `m`. `s` will still have at least `i+1` elements, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s` has at least `i+1` elements. `poss` can be either true or false, so no adjustment needed for `poss`. `arr` will have elements updated up to half the length of the original `t`, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect that `arr` has elements that are updated up to half the length of the original `t`.
State: **`t` is not empty, `m` is updated value, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` can be true or false, `arr` has elements updated up to half the length of the original `t`**
