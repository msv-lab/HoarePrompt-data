Example Answer:
The `write()` method of `file` writes the value of `sep`, which is a space ' '. The `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, so the space is written to the standard output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements**
