Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques. If the second element of `s` is 'T', `t` contains elements 0 and 1, `m` contains element 0, `s` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `si` is the second element in `s`. If the second element of `s` is not 'T', `t` remains as a deque with 1 element which is 0, and `m` contains elements 0 and 1. In both cases, `s` maintains its original characteristics as an iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` remains 1, and `si` is the second element in `s`.***
