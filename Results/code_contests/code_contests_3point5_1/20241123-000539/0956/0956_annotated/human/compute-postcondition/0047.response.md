Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t`, `m`, `arr`, `poss` are updated based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t`, `m`, `arr`, `poss` are updated based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet, `n` is an input integer**
