Example Answer:
The element at index `i` in the list `arr` is updated with the value popped from the left side of the deque `m`. The length of `t` is at least 1, so `m` is updated accordingly. The list `s` still has at least `i+2` elements. The boolean variable `poss` remains either true or false. 
Output State: **`t` has a length of at least 1, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` still has at least `i+2` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list with an element updated at index `i+1`**
