Postcondition: ***`t`, `m` are deques, `s` is an iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `si` is the third element in `s`. If the second element of `s` is 'T', `t` contains elements 0, 1, and 1, `m` contains element 0, and `si` is the third element in `s`. If the second element of `s` is not 'T', `t` remains as a deque with elements 0 and 1, `m` contains elements 0, 1, and 1, and `si` is the third element in `s`.***
