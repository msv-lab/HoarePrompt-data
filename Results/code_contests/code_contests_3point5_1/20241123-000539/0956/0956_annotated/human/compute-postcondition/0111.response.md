Output State: 
- `t` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are 'T' with an increased length based on the value of `si` and the indices appended during each iteration. 
- `m` is a deque containing the last index of `s` when `si` is not equal to 'T' in addition to the newly appended indices during each iteration.
- `s` is an iterable with at least `i+1` elements, where `i` is the last index of `s`.
- The lengths of `t` and `m` are adjusted accordingly with each iteration based on the condition of `si`.

Edge Cases:
- If `s` is an empty iterable, the loop will not execute, and both `t` and `m` will remain unchanged.
- If all elements in `s` are not equal to 'T', `t` will be empty, and `m` will contain all the indices of `s`.
- If all elements in `s` are 'T', `m` will be empty, and `t` will contain all the indices of `s`.
- Ensure proper handling of the cases where `n` might affect the loop or the variables.
