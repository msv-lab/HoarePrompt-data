According to the code, the loop can execute again if all elements in `arr` have not been iterated over. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is missing an element, `m` is updated value, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` has elements updated up to more than half the length of the original `t`, and `i` is still less than the value removed from the left of `t`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is missing an element, `m` is updated value, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` has elements updated up to more than half the length of the original `t`, and `i` is less than the length of `arr`**
