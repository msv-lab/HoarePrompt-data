According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `t` is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `t` must have a length of at least 2 in order for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` has a length of at least 2, `m` should be updated accordingly, `s` should have at least `i+1` elements where `i` is the upper limit of the loop, `poss` remains true, and `arr` should be adjusted to be a list of 0s with a length equal to half the updated length of `t`.
State: **`t` has a length of at least 2, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is true, `arr` is a list of 0s with a length equal to half the updated length of `t`**
