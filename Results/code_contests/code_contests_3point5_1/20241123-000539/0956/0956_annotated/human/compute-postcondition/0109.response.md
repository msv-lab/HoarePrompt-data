Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are 'T' with an increased length based on the value of `si` and the newly appended index `i+1`, `m` is a deque containing the last index of `s` when `si` is not equal to 'T' along with the newly appended index `i+1`, `s` is an iterable with at least `i+3` elements, and `i` is the last index of `s`. If `si` is 'T', the index `i` is appended to `t`. Otherwise, the index `i` is appended to `m`.***
