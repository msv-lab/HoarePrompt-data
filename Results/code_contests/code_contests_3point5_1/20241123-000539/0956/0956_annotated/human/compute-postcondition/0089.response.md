Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are not 'T', `s` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `i` is an index in `s`, `si` is the current element in `s`, and `poss` is a boolean indicating if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`. If `poss` is true, then `t` has a length of at least 1 and at most 2, and `m` has a length greater than or equal to the length of `t`. If the first element in `t` is not less than the first element in `m`, then `poss` remains unchanged. If the length of `m` is less than the length of `t`, the loop only iterates for the length of `m`. After the loop, `poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the last element in `arr`, and the lengths of `t` and `m` are adjusted accordingly.***
