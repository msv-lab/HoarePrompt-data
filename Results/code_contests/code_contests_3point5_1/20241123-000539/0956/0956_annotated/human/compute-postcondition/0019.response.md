According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of elements in `args`. If `args` has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `args` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 4 elements**
