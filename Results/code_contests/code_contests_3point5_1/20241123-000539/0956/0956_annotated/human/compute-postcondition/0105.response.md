Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are 'T' with an increased length based on the value of `si` and the newly appended index `i`. `m` is a deque containing the last index of `s` when `si` is not equal to 'T' along with the newly appended index. `s` is an iterable with at least `i+2` elements, and `i` is the last index of `s`. This ensures that both deques `t` and `m` are appropriately updated based on the condition of `si`, maintaining the integrity of the indices within `s` and the respective elements marked as 'T' or not.***
