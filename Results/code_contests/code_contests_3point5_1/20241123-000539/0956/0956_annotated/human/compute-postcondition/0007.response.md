Example Answer:
The `write` method is called on `file` to write the string representation of `x`. If `at_start` is False, then the value of `x` is written to the `file`. If `at_start` is True, then no action is taken. The variables `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unaffected by this operation.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is a boolean representing whether the operation is at the start or not, and `args` has at least 1 element**
