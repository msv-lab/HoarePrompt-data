Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of list `arr` is assigned the value popped from the left end of deque `m`. The length of `arr` is half the updated length of `t`, and `m` is updated by removing the leftmost element. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has a reduced length, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list with an element updated at index `i`.
Output State: **`t` has a reduced length, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list with an element updated at index `i`**
