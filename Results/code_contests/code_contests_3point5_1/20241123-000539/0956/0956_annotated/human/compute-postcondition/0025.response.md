The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string consisting of only the characters 'T' and 'M'. The constraints on `n` are that it should be an integer such that 3 â‰¤ n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3. The string entered in the document consists of only the characters 'T' and 'M'.

The function `func_2` does not return anything explicitly. It is likely designed to process each test case and perform some operations based on the input parameters provided within the constraints.
