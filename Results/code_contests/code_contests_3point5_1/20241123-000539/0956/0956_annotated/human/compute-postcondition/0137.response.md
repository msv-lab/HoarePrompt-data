Output State: **If s is an iterable with at least one element, the loop will execute and update the deques t and m with the indices of elements in s that are 'T' and not 'T', respectively. It will then check if the number of 'T' elements is double the number of non-'T' elements. If this condition is met, it will create an array arr and populate it with indices from the deques t and m, ensuring the order is correct. The variable poss will be True only if all conditions are met. If poss is True, the function func_2() will be called with 'YES' as an argument; otherwise, it will be called with 'NO'. If s is empty or the number of 'T' elements is not double the number of non-'T' elements, the loop will not execute, and func_2() will be called with 'NO'.**
