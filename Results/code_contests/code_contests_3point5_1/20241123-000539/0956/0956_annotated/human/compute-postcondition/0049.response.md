Example Answer: 
`t` is assigned an empty deque. Since no previous values are mentioned for the affected variables, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m`, `arr`, `poss` are updated based on conditions mentioned in the code snippet, `n` is an input integer, `s` contains the user input.
Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m`, `arr`, `poss` are updated based on conditions mentioned in the code snippet, `n` is an input integer, `s` contains the user input**
