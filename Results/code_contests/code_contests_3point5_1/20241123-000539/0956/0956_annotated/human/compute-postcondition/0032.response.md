Output State: `t`, `m` are deques, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the next index of the last element in `s` incremented by 1, `si` is the next element in `s`, `poss` is True if the next element in `s` is 'T' and False otherwise, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length of half the size of `t`, length of `t` is at least 2, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result of the popped element from deque `t` and the first element of deque `m`, and `arr[i]` is assigned the next value popped from deque `m`. `poss` is modified by performing a bitwise AND operation with the comparison result of the popped element from deque `t` and the first element of deque `m`.
