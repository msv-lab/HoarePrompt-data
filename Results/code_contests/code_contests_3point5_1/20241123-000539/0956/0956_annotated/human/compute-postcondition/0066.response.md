Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are not 'T'. `s` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the current element in `s`, and `si` is the current element in `s`. If `s` is empty, both `t` and `m` remain empty.**
