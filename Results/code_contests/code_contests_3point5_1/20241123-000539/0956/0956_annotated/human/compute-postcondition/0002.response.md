Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `sep` and `file` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the default value ' ', `file` is assigned the default value sys.stdout, and `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the default value ' ', `file` is assigned the default value sys.stdout, and `at_start` is True**
