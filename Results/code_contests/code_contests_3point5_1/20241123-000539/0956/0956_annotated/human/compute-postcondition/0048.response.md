Example Answer:
The input taken from the user is stored in variable `s`. The values of `t`, `m`, `arr`, and `poss` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `m`, `arr`, `poss` are updated based on conditions mentioned in the code snippet, `n` is an input integer, and `s` contains the user input.
Output State: **`t`, `m`, `arr`, `poss` are updated based on conditions mentioned in the code snippet, `n` is an input integer, `s` contains the user input**
