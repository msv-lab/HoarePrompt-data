Output State: **After the loop executes, `t` might be empty before the loop finishes, `m` is the updated value, `s` still has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` has elements updated up to more than half the length of the original `t`, and `i` is less than the value removed from the left of `t`. If `t` is empty before the loop finishes, then `poss` will be based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()` and the loop does not execute.**
