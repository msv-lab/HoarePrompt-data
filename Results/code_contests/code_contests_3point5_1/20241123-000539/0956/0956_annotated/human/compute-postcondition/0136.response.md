According to the code, the loop will execute `t` number of times. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a deque, `m` is a deque, `s` is an iterable, `poss` is a boolean, `arr` contains updated elements, `i` is an integer, and the function `func_2()` is called with either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `poss`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` needs to be decremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a deque with one less element, `m` is a deque, `s` is an iterable, `poss` is a boolean, `arr` contains updated elements, `i` is an integer, and the function `func_2()` is called with either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `poss`.**
