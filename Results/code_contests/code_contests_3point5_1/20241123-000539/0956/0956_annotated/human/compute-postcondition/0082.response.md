Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared to the first element of deque `t` after removing it. If `i` is less than the removed element, `poss` remains true; otherwise, it becomes false. The length of `t` is at least 2, and the length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the first element in deque `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, length of `m` is greater than or equal to length of `t`.
Output State: **`poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the first element in deque `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, length of `m` is greater than or equal to length of `t`**
