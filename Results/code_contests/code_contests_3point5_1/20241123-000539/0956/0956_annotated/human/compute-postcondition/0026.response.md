Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes test cases that consist of an integer `n` and a string containing only 'T' and 'M'. It concatenates the elements in `args` with the separator `sep` and writes the result to the file `file`. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute. It then writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the file is flushed. The function does not explicitly return any value. The annotations mention constraints and parameters related to test cases that are not reflected in the actual code.**
