Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque with 1 element which is 0 if the first element of `s` is 'T'. Otherwise, `m` is a deque with 1 element which is 0. `s` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `si` is the first element in `s`. If the first element of `s` is not 'T', `t` remains empty.***
