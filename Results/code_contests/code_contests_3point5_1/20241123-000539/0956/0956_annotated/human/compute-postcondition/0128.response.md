According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. If `arr` still has elements to iterate over, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `t` remains empty
- `m` is an updated value
- `s` still has at least `i+1` elements
- `poss` remains either true or false
- `arr` needs to have elements updated up to more than half the length of the original `t`
- `i` needs to be less than the value removed from the left of `t`

State: **`t` is empty, `m` is updated value, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` has elements updated up to more than half the length of the original `t`, and `i` is still less than the value removed from the left of `t`**
