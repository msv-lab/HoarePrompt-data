According to the code, the loop can execute if the `args` list has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, `sep` is assigned the default value ' ', so it does not impact the loop execution. Similarly, `file` being assigned the default value sys.stdout also does not affect the loop execution. However, `at_start` being True is not necessary for the loop to execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `args` list must have at least 1 element.
State: **`sep` is assigned the default value ' ', `file` is assigned the default value sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, `args` has at least 1 element**
