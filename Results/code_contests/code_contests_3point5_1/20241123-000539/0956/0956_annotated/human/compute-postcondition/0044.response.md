Postcondition: ***`t`, `m` are deques, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the index of the last element in `s`, `si` is the last element in `s`. If the last element in `s` is 'T', then `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`. If the last element in `s` is not 'T', then `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `t`, `m` remain empty. `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' elements in `s` is twice the number of 'T' elements in `s`, False otherwise. If `s` is not empty and the last element in `s` is 'T', `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`, `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is populated from deque `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result of deque `t` and `m`, and `i` is updated. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `t`, `m`, `arr`, and `poss` remain empty.***
