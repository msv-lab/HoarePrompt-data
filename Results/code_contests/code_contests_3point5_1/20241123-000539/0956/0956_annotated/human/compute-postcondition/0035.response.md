Output State: **If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `t`, `m`, and `arr` remain empty. If the last element in `s` is 'T', `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`, `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`, and `poss` is True. The loop iterates over half the size of `t`, updating `poss` based on the comparison result of deque `t` and `m`, and assigns values to `arr` from deque `m`.**
