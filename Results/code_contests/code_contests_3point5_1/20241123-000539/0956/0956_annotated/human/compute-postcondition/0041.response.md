Example Answer:
The code performs a bitwise AND operation between `poss` and the condition `i < t.popleft()`. If `i` is less than the first element removed from `t`, `poss` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than or equal to the first element removed from `t`, `poss` is updated to False. The value of `i` is updated to the next element in `arr`, and `arr` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: If `s` is not empty and the last element in `s` is 'T', `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`, `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is populated from deque `m`, `poss` is updated to False if `i` is greater than or equal to the first element removed from `t`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `arr` is updated to the next element in the deque.
Output State: **If `s` is not empty and the last element in `s` is 'T', `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`, `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`, `poss` is updated based on the condition, `i` is updated, and `arr` is modified accordingly.**
