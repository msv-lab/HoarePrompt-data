According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is not empty and the last element in `s` is 'T', `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`, `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is populated from deque `m`, `poss` is False if `i` is greater than or equal to the first element removed from `t`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` should not be empty.
State: **If `s` is not empty and the last element in `s` is 'T', `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`, `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is populated from deque `m`, `poss` is False if `i` is greater than or equal to the first element removed from `t` and `arr` is not empty**
