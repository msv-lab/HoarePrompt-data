According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. If the length of `t` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has a length of at least 1, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` still has at least `i+2` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list with an element updated at index `i+1`. To execute the loop one more time, the length of `t` needs to be at least 3, and all other states remain the same.
State: **`t` has a length of at least 3, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` still has at least `i+2` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list with an element updated at index `i+1`**
