Example Answer:
The value of `poss` is updated by performing a logical AND operation with the condition `i < t.popleft()`. If the condition is true, `poss` remains true; otherwise, it becomes false. The values of `i` and `arr` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, and length of `m` is greater than or equal to length of `t`.
Output State: **`poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, and length of `m` is greater than or equal to length of `t`**
