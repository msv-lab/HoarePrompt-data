Output State: **If `s` is not empty and the last element in `s` is 'T', `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`, `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is populated from deque `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison result of deque `t` and `m`, and `i` is updated. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `t`, `m`, `arr`, and `poss` remain empty.**
