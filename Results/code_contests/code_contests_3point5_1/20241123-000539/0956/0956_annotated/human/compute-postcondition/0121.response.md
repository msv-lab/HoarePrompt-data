According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of list `t`. If the length of `t` is still greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has a further reduced length, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` still has at least `i+2` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list with an element updated at index `i+1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` needs to have a length of at least 2.
State: **`t` has a length of at least 2, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` still has at least `i+2` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list with an element updated at index `i+1`**
