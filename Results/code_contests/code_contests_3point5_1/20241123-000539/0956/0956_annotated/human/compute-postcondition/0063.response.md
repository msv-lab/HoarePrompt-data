Output State: **In the case where the second element of `s` is 'T', `t` contains elements 0, 1, and 1, `m` contains elements 0 and 1, `s` is an iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, and `si` is the third element in `s`. In the case where the second element of `s` is not 'T', `t` remains as a deque with 1 element which is 0, and `m` contains elements 0, 1, and 1. `s` maintains its original characteristics as an iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` remains 1, and `si` is the third element in `s**.
