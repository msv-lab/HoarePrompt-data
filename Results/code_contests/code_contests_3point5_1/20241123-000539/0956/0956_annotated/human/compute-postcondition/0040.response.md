According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `arr` deque and the conditions related to `poss` being False. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given:
- `s` is not empty and the last element in `s` is 'T'
- `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`
- `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`
- `poss` is True
- `arr` is populated from deque `m`
- `poss` is False if `i` is greater than or equal to the first element removed from `t` and `arr` is not empty

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Update `arr` to the next element in the deque
- Update `i` to the next element in `arr`

State: **Output State: If `s` is not empty and the last element in `s` is 'T', `t` contains the indices of all 'T' elements in `s`, `m` contains the indices of all non-'T' elements in `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is populated from deque `m`, `poss` is False if `i` is greater than or equal to the first element removed from `t` and `arr` is not empty, then `poss` is updated to False if `i` is greater than or equal to the first element removed from `t`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `arr` is updated to the next element in the deque.**
