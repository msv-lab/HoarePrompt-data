Example Answer: 
The index `i` is appended to the deque `m`. The length of `m` increases by 1, and the new element added at the end of `m` is the index `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are 'T' with an increased length depending on the value of `si`, `m` is a deque containing the last index of `s` when `si` is not equal to 'T' along with the newly appended index.
Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are 'T' with an increased length depending on the value of `si`, `m` is a deque containing the last index of `s` when `si` is not equal to 'T' along with the newly appended index**
