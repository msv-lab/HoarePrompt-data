According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is missing an element, `m` is updated value, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` has elements updated up to more than half the length of the original `t`, and `i` is less than the length of `arr`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. Update `t` to have one more element added.
2. Update `s` to have at least `i+2` elements.
3. Update `arr` to have elements updated to more than half the length of the original `t` plus one.
4. Update `i` to `i+1`.

State: **`t` has one more element, `m` is updated value, `s` has at least `i+2` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` has elements updated to more than half the length of the original `t` plus one, `i` is incremented by 1**
