Example Answer:
The value of `poss` is updated to `t.popleft() < m[0]`. The length of `t` is reduced by removing the leftmost element. If the condition `t.popleft() < m[0]` is true, then `poss` will remain true; otherwise, it will turn false. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`t` has a reduced length, `m` is updated accordingly, `s` has at least `i+1` elements, `poss` is either true or false, `arr` is a list of 0s with a length equal to half the updated length of `t`**
