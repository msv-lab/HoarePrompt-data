Output State: **The loop checks if the first element in deque `t` is less than the first element in deque `m`, if not `poss` becomes false. The loop then assigns the first element in deque `m` to the corresponding index in `arr`. If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop won't execute and `poss` will remain true. If the length of `m` is less than the length of `t`, the loop will only execute for the length of `m`, and `poss` will be false.**
