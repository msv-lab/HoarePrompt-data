According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in the `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `poss` can be either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, and the length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be assigned the element after the current element in `arr`.
State: **`poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, and length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`**
