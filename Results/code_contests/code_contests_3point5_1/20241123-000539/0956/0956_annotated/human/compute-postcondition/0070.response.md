According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `t` is greater than or equal to 2 for the integer division to be at least 1. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

State: **`t` is a deque containing indices of elements in `s` that are 'T' with length at least 2, `m` is a deque containing indices of elements in `s` that are not 'T', `s` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `i` is the index of the current element in `s`, `si` is the current element in `s`, `poss` is true, `arr` is a list filled with zeros with a length that is the integer division of the length of `t` by 2**
