Example Answer:
The value of `poss` is updated to be the logical AND between its current value and the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. The value of `i` is updated to the next element in `arr`, and the `popleft()` method removes and returns the first element in the `t` queue. If the comparison is true, `poss` remains true; otherwise, it becomes false. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, and length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`.
Output State: **`poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, and length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`**
