Postcondition: ***The loop concatenates the elements in `args` with the separator `sep` and writes the result to the file. `at_start` is set to False after the first iteration. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True. The function writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the file is flushed. Otherwise, the program continues as described above.***
