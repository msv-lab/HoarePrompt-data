According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements left in the `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, and length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `arr` should be assigned to `i`.
State: **`poss` is either true or false, `i` is assigned the next element in `arr`, length of `t` is at least 1, and length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`**
