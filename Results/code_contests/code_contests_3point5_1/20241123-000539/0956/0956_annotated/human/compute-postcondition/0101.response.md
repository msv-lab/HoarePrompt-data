Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of elements in `s` that are 'T' with an increased length depending on the value of `si`. If `si` equals 'T', the index `i` is appended to `t`. Otherwise, the index `i` is appended to `m`. `m` is a deque containing the last index of `s` when `si` is not equal to 'T'. `s` is an iterable with at least 1 element. `i` is the last index of `s`. The lengths of `t` and `m` are adjusted accordingly based on the condition met.***
