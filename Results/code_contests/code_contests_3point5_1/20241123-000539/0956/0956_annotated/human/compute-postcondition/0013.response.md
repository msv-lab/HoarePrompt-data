Example Answer: 
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, and `at_start` already had the value `False`, so there is no change in the state. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements**
