According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the deque `t`, deque `m`, and the length of `arr`. If the length of `t` is at least 2 and the length of `m` is greater than or equal to the length of `t`, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `poss` needs to be true, and `i` should be assigned the first element in deque `arr`.
State: **`poss` is true, `i` is assigned the first element in deque `arr`, length of `t` is at least 2, length of `m` is greater than or equal to length of `t`**
