Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, checks if the string can be partitioned into subsequences of 'TMT', and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The logic of checking if the number of 'T' elements is double the number of non-'T' elements and ensuring the correct order of indices is correctly implemented. The program handles all test cases provided in the problem description and works as expected.
