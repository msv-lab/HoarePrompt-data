According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. If the list has at least 5 elements, the loop will execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, `d` starts from the fourth element of `list_divisors`. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 5 elements, `d` should be the fifth element in the list. 

State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`**
