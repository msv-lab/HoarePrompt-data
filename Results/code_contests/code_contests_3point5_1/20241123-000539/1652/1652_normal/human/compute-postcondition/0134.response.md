Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
