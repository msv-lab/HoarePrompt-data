Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. In both cases, `a` and `b` are then swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values.***
