Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, `d` starts from the third element of list_divisors. In the if part, if `d % b == 0`, `b` is updated to `d`. In the else part, if `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d`. If `d % a != 0`, `a` remains unchanged. In all cases, `b` remains the same as before the if statement. Additionally, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. In the else part, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d % b` is not equal to 0.***
