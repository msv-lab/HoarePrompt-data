Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain the same. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `a` or `b`.
