Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
