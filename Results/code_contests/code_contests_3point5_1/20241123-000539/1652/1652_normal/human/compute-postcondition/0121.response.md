Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, `d` starts from the fourth element of `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. After executing the code snippet, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.**
