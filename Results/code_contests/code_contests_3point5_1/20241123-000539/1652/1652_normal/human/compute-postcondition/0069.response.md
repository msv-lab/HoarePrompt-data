Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are updated based on divisibility conditions. If `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After this, `a` and `b` are swapped if necessary. If `d` is not greater than or equal to `b`, and is greater than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `d` if divisible by `d`. In all other cases, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
