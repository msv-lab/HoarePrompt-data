Example Answer:
The `list_divisors` variable is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the elements of `line` after splitting it by spaces. The values of `nb_test` and `idx` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line.**
