Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain the same. The initial values of `a` and `b` are not provided, so the output state can be one of the following:
- If `a > b`, then `a` is updated to the initial value of `b` and `b` is updated to the initial value of `a`.
- If `a <= b`, then `a` and `b` remain the same.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`.**
