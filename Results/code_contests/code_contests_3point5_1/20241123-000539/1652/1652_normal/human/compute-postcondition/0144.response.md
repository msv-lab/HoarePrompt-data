Functionality: **The function `func` reads input lines from `sys.stdin` and processes them to find and update the largest divisors `a` and `b` based on specific conditions related to divisors. If the input index `idx` is not 0, the function updates `a` and `b` according to divisibility conditions with divisors from the input. The final values of `a` and `b` are then printed. If the input index `idx` is 0 or if the input has less than 3 elements, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The function does not calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n as indicated in the annotations.**
