Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, no changes are made to the variables.***
