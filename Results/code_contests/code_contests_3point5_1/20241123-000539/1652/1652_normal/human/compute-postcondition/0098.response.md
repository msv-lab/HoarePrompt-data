Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. The initial values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the `list_divisors` obtained from the `line` variable. Therefore, after execution, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b` based on the initial values from the `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains integer values obtained after splitting the `line` variable, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`**
