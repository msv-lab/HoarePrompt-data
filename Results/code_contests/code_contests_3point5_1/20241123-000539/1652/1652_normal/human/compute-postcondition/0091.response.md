Output State: 
- If `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute at least once. 
- After the loop executes, `nb_test` remains 0, `idx` remains 1, and `line` is unchanged. 
- The loop updates `a` and `b` based on divisibility conditions with the elements of `list_divisors`. 
- If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, `b` is updated to `d`. 
- If `d >= b` and `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d`. 
- If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d`. 
- If the loop does not execute, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- If `list_divisors` has exactly 3 elements, the loop will execute once and update `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified.
- If `list_divisors` has more than 3 elements, the loop will execute multiple times updating `a` and `b` accordingly.
