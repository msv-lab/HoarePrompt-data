Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, `d` starts from the third element of list_divisors. In the if part, if `d % b == 0`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d % b` is not equal to 0 and `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d`. If neither condition is met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. In the elif part, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`.***
