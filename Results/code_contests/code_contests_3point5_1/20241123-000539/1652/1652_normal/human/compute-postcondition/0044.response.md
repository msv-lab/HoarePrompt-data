According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 5 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, then no changes occur in the variables. Additionally, after the if else block executes, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `list_divisors`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 6 elements**.
