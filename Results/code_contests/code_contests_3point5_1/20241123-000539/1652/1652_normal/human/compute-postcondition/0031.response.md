Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 4 elements. If `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
