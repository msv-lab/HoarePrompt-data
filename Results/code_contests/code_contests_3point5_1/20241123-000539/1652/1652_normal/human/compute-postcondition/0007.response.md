According to the code, the loop can execute if `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted so that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. Since `a` is the second element and `b` is the first element, the loop will execute when `d` iterates over the elements starting from the third element of `list_divisors`. Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 3 elements, `a` is the second element of `list_divisors`, `b` is the first element of `list_divisors`, `d` is iterating over `list_divisors` starting from the third element**
