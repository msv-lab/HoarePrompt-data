According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 4 elements. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `list_divisors` should have at least 5 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 5 elements**
