According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. To execute the loop one more time, `d` should be the next element in `list_divisors`, so `idx` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements**
