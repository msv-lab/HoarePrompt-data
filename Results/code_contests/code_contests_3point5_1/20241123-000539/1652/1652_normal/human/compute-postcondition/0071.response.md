Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, but the value of `d` is not given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements**
