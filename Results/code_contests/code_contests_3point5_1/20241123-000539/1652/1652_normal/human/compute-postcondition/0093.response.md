Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input. If the loop executes, `a` and `b` are updated based on the divisibility conditions with the elements of `list_divisors`. After the loop execution, `a` and `b` contain the greatest common divisors found in the list_divisors. If the loop does not execute, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
