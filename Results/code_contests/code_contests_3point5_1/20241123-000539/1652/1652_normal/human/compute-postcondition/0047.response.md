Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `line` is the first line of input. The values of `a` and `b` are integers representing divisors. If `idx` is not equal to 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions provided. If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` and `b` are modified by iterating through the divisors in the list. The final values of `a` and `b` are printed.***
