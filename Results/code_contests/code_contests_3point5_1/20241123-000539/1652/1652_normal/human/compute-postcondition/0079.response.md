Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If neither of these conditions hold, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise no change occurs in the variables.***
