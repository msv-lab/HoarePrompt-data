According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 5 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, and `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. To adjust for the next iteration, `list_divisors` needs to have at least 5 elements, and the loop will start with the next element in the list.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements**
