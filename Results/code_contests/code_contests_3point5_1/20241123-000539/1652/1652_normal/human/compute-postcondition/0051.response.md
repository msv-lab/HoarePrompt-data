Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the first element of `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the second element of `list_divisors`. The previous values of `nb_test` and `idx` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions**
