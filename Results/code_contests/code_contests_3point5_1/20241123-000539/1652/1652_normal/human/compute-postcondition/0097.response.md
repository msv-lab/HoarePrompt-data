Example Answer: 
Variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of `list_divisors` respectively. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the values stored in `list_divisors`, which are obtained from splitting the `line` variable. The initial state of the program includes `nb_test` being 0, `idx` being 2, `line` being the next line of input, and `list_divisors` containing integer values obtained after splitting the `line` variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains integer values obtained after splitting the `line` variable, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains integer values obtained after splitting the `line` variable, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on `list_divisors`**
