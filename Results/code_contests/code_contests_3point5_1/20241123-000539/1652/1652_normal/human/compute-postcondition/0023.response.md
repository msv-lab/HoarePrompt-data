Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 3 elements. `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions inside the if else block. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, otherwise remains unchanged. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. The final values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. If none of the conditions hold true, the values of `a` and `b` remain as they were before the execution of the if else block.***
