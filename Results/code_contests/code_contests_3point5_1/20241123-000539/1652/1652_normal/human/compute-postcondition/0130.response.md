Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. If the fifth element `d` in `list_divisors` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, `nb_test`, `idx`, `line`, `list_divisors`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
