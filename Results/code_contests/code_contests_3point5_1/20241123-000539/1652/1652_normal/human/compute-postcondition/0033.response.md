Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. The values of `a` and `b` may have been updated based on the conditions inside the if else block for the next element `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
