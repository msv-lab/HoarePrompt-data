According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is input from `sys.stdin`. Initially, `nb_test` is 0 and `idx` is 0. To ensure the loop executes, the input from `sys.stdin` should be present at the beginning. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that there is input available from `sys.stdin` and `line` is the first line of input.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input**
