Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` is either updated to the value of `d` if `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is updated based on conditions, list_divisors has at least 3 elements, and the value of `d` is less than `b`.***
