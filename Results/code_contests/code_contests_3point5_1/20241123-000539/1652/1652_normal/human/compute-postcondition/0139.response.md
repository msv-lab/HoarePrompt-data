Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input. If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `a` and `b` will contain the largest divisors of `a` and `b` respectively from the list `list_divisors`. The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions within the loop. `nb_test` remains 0 and `idx` remains 2.***
