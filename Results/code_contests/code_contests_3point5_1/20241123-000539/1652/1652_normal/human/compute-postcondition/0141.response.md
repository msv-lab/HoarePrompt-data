According to the code, the loop can execute again if `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `line` is the next line of input. Since the loop did not execute, no changes are needed for `nb_test` and `idx`. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `line` is the next line of input.**
