Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d >= b` and `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d`. If `d >= b` and neither condition holds, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to `d`. If `d >= a` and `d % a != 0`, no changes are made to `a` or `b`.***
