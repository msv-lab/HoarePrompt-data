Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, and `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. No other changes occur in the program variables.***
