According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `list_divisors` starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. For the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 6 elements and the loop should move to the next element in the list. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 6 elements, `d` is the sixth element in `list_divisors`**
