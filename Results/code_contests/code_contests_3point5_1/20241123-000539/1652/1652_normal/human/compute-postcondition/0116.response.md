According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `list_divisors` starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, and `d` starts from the third element of `list_divisors`. Since the loop is iterating over `list_divisors[2:]`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 4 elements in `list_divisors`, and `d` should move to the fourth element. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, `d` starts from the fourth element of `list_divisors`**
