According to the code, the loop can execute if the list_divisors has at least 3 elements. 
For the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions, and list_divisors has at least 3 elements.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions, list_divisors has at least 3 elements**
