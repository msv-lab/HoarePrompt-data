According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in `list_divisors` starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 3 elements. The values of `a` and `b` have been updated based on the conditions inside the if else block. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `d` in `list_divisors` should be considered. The states that need adjustment are:
- `list_divisors` should have at least 4 elements (since we are considering the next element starting from the third element).
- The values of `a` and `b` may need to be updated based on the conditions inside the if else block for the next element `d`.

State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 4 elements. The values of `a` and `b` may have been updated based on the conditions inside the if else block for the next element `d`**
