Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the first element of `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the second element of `list_divisors`. The values of `a` and `b` are dependent on the input provided, which are the first two elements of `list_divisors`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line, `a` is the first element of `list_divisors`, `b` is the second element of `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line, `a` is the first element of `list_divisors`, `b` is the second element of `list_divisors`**
