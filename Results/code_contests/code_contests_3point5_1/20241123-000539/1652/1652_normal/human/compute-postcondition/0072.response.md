Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The previous values of `a` and `d` are not provided, so the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `d`**
