Example Answer:
The variable `list_divisors` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the `line` variable. The `line` variable is not provided in the initial state, so its value is unknown. The output state will be `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, and `line` is the next line of input, and `list_divisors` contains the integer values obtained after splitting the `line` variable.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains integer values obtained after splitting the `line` variable**
