Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `a` or `b`.***
