Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. The initial values of `a` and `b` are not provided, so we cannot determine the final values. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions**
