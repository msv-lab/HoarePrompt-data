Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, but the value of `d` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 5 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 5 elements**
