Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 3 elements. `a` is either the original `a` or the latest value of `d` if `d` was divisible by `a`, `b` is the first element of `list_divisors`, `d` is iterating over `list_divisors` starting from the third element. The value of `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`.***
