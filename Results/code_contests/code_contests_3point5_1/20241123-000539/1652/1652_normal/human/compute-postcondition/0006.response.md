Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain the same. The initial values of `a` and `b` are obtained from the input line as the first two elements of `list_divisors`. After executing the code, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line, `a` is the second element of `list_divisors`, `b` is the first element of `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line, `a` is the second element of `list_divisors`, `b` is the first element of `list_divisors`**
