According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_divisors. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute starting from the third element. Before the loop starts, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, and line is the next line of input. To execute the loop, the list_divisors must have at least 3 elements, `d` should start from the third element of list_divisors, `a` and `b` should be swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, `d` starts from the third element of list_divisors, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`**
