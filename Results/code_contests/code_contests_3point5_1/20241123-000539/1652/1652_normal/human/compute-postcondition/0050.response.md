Example Answer: 
The variable `list_divisors` is created by mapping the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting `line` at spaces. The `line` is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces before splitting. Since we don't have the actual input value for `line`, we cannot determine the exact values in `list_divisors`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `a` and `b` are updated based on conditions**
