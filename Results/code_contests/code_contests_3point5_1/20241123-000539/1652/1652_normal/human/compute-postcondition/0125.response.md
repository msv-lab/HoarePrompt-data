Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, `d` starts from the fourth element of `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After the execution of the code snippet, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Ensure all possible cases are covered, including boundary values and edge cases for `d`, `a`, and `b`***
