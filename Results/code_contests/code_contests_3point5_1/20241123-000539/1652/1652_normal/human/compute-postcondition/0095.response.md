According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. If there is more input available, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input. In order for the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be more input available. Therefore, `nb_test` should remain 0, `idx` should remain 2, and `line` should be updated to the next line of input.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `line` is the next line of input**
