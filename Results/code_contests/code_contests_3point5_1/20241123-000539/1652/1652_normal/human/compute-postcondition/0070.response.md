According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. If `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time `list_divisors` needs to have at least 4 elements.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `line` is the next line of input, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements**
