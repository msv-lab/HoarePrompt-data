Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is the first line of input, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line with at least 3 elements, `a` is the second element of `list_divisors`, `b` is equal to `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, otherwise it remains the same as the initial value, and `d` is iterating over `list_divisors` starting from the third element. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If neither condition holds true, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
