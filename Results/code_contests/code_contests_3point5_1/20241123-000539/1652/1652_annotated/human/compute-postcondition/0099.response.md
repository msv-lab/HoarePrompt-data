According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. If the list has at least 3 elements (starting from index 2), the loop will execute. 
For the loop to execute, `nb_test` needs to be adjusted to 1, `idx` needs to be adjusted to 2, `a` should be the value of `list_divisors[2]` and `b` should be the value of `list_divisors[3]`.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` is `list_divisors[2]`, `b` is `list_divisors[3]`**
