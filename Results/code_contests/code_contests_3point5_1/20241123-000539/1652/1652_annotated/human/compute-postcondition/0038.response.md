Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to be equal to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. In all other cases, no changes are made to the variables `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b`.***
