Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The values of `a` and `b` are unknown as they were adjusted based on a condition earlier. The list `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 4 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 4 elements**
