Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
