Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the value of `d`. If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d >= b` but `d % b != 0` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d` and `b` remains the same. If `d >= b` but neither `d % b == 0` nor `d % a == 0`, then `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b`, otherwise they remain the same. If `d < b`, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. In all other cases where `d >= a` but `d % a != 0`, `a` remains the value of `d`. If `d < a`, `a` remains unchanged. No changes are made to `b`, `nb_test`, or `idx` regardless of the conditions.***
