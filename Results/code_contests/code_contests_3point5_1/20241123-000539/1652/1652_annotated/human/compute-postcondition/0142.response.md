Output State: **If there are less than 3 elements in `list_divisors`, the loop will not execute. After the loop executes, `a` and `b` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the two largest divisors present in `list_divisors`. The values of `a` and `b` are then written to the standard output. `nb_test` will be 1 after the loop finishes, and `idx` will be the number of iterations.**
