Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors` that meet the specified conditions. If the next element `d` in `list_divisors` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If neither condition is met, `a` and `b` may be swapped based on their values. The values of `nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged.***
