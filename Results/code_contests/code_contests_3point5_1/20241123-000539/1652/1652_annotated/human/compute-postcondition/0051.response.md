Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of `list_divisors`, respectively. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the input received and stored in `list_divisors`. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input stored in `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input stored in `list_divisors`**
