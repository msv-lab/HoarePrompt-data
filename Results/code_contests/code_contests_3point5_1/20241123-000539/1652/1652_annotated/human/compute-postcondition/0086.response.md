Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and the value of `d` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements**
