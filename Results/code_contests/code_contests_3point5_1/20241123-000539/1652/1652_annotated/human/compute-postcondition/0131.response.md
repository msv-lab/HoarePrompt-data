Example Answer: 
If a is greater than b, then a and b are swapped, otherwise, they remain the same. Since the initial values are not provided, the output state will depend on the initial values of a and b. Therefore, the Output State is: nb_test is 1, idx is 2, a and b are updated based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State: **nb_test is 1, idx is 2, a and b are updated based on the conditions in the loop**
