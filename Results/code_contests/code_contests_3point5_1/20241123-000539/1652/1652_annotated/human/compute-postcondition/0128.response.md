Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`, but the value of `d` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, and `b` is updated based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, and `b` is updated based on the conditions in the loop**
