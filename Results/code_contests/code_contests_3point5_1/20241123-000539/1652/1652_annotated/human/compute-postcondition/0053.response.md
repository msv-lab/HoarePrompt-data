According to the code, the loop can execute if the list_divisors has at least 3 elements. Before the loop starts, `nb_test` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, and the values of `a` and `b` need to be checked to see if they have swapped values or retained their original values based on the condition mentioned. 
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 3 elements**
