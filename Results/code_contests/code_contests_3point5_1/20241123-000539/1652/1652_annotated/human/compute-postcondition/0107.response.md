Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` is either `list_divisors[2]` or `d`, `b` is either `d` or `list_divisors[3]`, and the value of `d` is greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`.***
