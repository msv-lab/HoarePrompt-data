According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, and the values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions mentioned. The key adjustments to consider for the loop to execute one more time are:
1. Check if there are more elements in `list_divisors` after the current index.
2. Ensure `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions for the new iteration.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements**
