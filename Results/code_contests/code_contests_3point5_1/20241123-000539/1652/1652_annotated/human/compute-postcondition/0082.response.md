Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` could be any value based on previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements**
