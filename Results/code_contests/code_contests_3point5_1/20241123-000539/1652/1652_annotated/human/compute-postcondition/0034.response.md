According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the list_divisors. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the value of `d`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`.
- If `d >= b` but `d % b != 0` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d` and `b` remains the same.
- If `d >= b` but neither `d % b == 0` nor `d % a == 0`, then `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b`, otherwise they remain the same.
- If `d < b`, no changes are made to `a` or `b`.
- If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`.
- In all other cases where `d >= a` but `d % a != 0`, `a` remains the value of `d`.
- If `d < a`, `a` remains unchanged.

No changes need to be made to `b`, `nb_test`, or `idx` regardless of the conditions.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the value of `d`, `b` is updated according to the conditions mentioned above**
