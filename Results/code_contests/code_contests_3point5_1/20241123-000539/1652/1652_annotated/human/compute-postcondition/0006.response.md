Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. The initial values of `a` and `b` are the first and second elements of `list_divisors` respectively. Therefore, after execution, `a` and `b` will be rearranged accordingly. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is the second element of list_divisors, `b` is the first element of list_divisors**
