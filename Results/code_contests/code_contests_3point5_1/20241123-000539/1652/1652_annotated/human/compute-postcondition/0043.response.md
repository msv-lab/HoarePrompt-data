Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the value of `d`, `b` is updated based on the conditions mentioned below. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to be equal to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. If none of the above conditions hold true, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b` or remain unchanged if `a <= b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, `a`, `b`, and `idx` remain unchanged.***
