Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`, but the initial value of `d` is not provided. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 4 elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 4 elements**
