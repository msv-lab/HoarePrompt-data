Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value of `d`. The values of other variables are not mentioned to have changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements, `b` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements, `b` is assigned the value of `d`**
