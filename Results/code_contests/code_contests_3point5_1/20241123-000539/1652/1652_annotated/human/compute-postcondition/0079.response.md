Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `a` but not by `b`, `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Subsequently, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements.***
