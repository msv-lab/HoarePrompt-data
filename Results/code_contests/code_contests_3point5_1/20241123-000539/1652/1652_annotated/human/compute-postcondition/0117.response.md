Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` that meets the specified conditions. The initial state does not provide information about the specific values of `a`, `b`, or `d`, so the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors` such that the conditions specified in the code are met for the next element `d` in `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors` such that the conditions specified in the code are met for the next element `d` in `list_divisors`**
