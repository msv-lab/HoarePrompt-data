Example Answer: 
The variables `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are taken from the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the values of `a` and `b` will be swapped accordingly. The values of `nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors`, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.**
