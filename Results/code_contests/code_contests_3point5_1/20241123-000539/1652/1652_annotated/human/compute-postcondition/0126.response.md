According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `list_divisors`. If there are more elements available in the list, the loop will execute. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, and `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors` that meet certain conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `d` in `list_divisors` should be considered.

1. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`.
2. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`.
3. If neither condition is met, `a` and `b` may be swapped based on their values.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are the values of `a` and `b` based on the conditions mentioned above.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions in the loop**
