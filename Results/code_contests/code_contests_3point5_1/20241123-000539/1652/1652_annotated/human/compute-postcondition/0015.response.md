Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the third element of list_divisors, `b` is either the value of `d` or the second element of list_divisors depending on the conditions. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`.***
