According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input available from the `sys.stdin`. Since `sys.stdin` is a standard input stream, as long as there is some input, the loop will execute. At the start, `nb_test` is 0 and `idx` is 0, which do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to signify that there is input available from `sys.stdin`.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, there is available input from `sys.stdin`**
