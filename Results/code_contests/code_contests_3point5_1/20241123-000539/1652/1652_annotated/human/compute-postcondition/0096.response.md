Example Answer:
The `list_divisors` variable is reassigned the result of mapping the elements of the input `line` after splitting it by space and converting each element to an integer. Since the number of elements in `list_divisors` is not specified and it has at least 3 elements, the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` has been updated with integer elements.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` has been updated with integer elements**
