Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, `b` is equal to `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b`, and `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements.***
