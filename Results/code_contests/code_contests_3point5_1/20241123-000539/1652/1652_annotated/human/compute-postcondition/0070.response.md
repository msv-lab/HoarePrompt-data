According to the code, the loop can execute again if `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 3 elements. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 4 elements. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 4 elements**
