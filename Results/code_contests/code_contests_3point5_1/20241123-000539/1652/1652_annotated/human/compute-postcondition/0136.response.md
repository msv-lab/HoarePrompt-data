According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_divisors. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2. To execute the loop again, `d` should be the next element in the list_divisors. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to be the third element in the list_divisors.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `d` is the third element in list_divisors**
