Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `list_divisors[0]` and `b` is assigned the value `list_divisors[1]` from the input list. The initial state of `nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is the first element of list_divisors, `b` is the second element of list_divisors**
