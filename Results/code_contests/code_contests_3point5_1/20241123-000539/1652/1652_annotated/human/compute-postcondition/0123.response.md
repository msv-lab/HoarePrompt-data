Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` is the next element `d` in `list_divisors`, and `b` is from `list_divisors` meeting the specified conditions. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all other cases, the values of `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
