Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input values separated by spaces into integers and assigns them to the `list_divisors` variable. The `line` variable is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values in the `list_divisors` variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and list_divisors is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and list_divisors is a list of integers obtained from input**
