According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is available input from `sys.stdin` and `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and there is available input from `sys.stdin`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list_divisors must have at least 3 elements, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, there is available input from `sys.stdin`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements**
