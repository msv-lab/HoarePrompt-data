Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. The values of `a` and `b` are then swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.***
