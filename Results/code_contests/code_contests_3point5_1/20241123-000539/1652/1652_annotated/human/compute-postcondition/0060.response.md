Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 3 elements. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to the value of `b`, and the value of `d` is not divisible by `b`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`.***
