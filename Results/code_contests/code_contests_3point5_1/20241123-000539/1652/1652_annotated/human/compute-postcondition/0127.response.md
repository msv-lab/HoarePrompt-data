Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value of `d`. There is no information provided about the value of `d`, so the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions in the loop, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions in the loop, `b` is assigned the value of `d`**
