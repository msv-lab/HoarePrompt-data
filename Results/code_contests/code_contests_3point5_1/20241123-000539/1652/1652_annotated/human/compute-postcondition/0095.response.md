According to the code, the loop will execute based on the conditions involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `d`, as well as the length of `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, and `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. Since `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again.

To determine the next values of `a` and `b`, we need to consider the conditions involving `d`, `a`, and `b` within the loop. The loop ensures that `a` and `b` are set to the two largest divisors present in `list_divisors`. Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `a` and `b` based on the divisors in `list_divisors`.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements**
