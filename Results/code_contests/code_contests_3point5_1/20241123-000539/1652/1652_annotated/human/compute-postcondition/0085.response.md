Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the conditions for the new iteration, `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements. If d is divisible by b, then `b` is updated to d. If d is not divisible by b but divisible by a, then `a` is updated to d. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `a` and `b`.**
