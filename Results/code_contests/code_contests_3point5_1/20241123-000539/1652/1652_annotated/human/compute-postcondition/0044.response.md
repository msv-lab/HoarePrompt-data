According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the list_divisors. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the value of `d`, and `b` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` should be updated to be equal to `d`.
- If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` should be updated to be equal to `d`.
- If none of the above conditions hold true, `a` and `b` should be swapped if `a > b` or remain unchanged if `a <= b`.
- If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` should be updated to the value of `d`.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
