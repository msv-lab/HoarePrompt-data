Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors` such that `a` is either the initial `list_divisors[2]` or `d`, and `b` is either `d` or the initial `list_divisors[3]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After the execution, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain the same. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. No other variables are affected by this operation.***
