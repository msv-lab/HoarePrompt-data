According to the code, the loop will execute if the `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. At the end of the previous iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 3, and `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. Since the loop will execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `list_divisors` still has at least 3 elements for the next iteration.
State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements**
