According to the code, the loop will execute for each element `d` in `list_divisors` starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors` such that `a` is either the initial `list_divisors[2]` or `d`, and `b` is either `d` or the initial `list_divisors[3]`. The conditions for updating `a` and `b` based on the value of `d` have been specified. After the execution, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.

To execute the loop one more time, the next element `d` from `list_divisors` should be considered. The values of `a` and `b` should be updated based on the conditions specified in the code.

State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors` such that the conditions specified in the code are met for the next element `d` in `list_divisors`.**
