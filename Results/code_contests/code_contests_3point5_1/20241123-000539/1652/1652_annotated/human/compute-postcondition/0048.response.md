Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, there is available input from `sys.stdin`. If list_divisors has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute. After the loop executes, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code. Then, `%d %d\n' % (a, b) is written to stdout. The variables `a` and `b` are modified according to the conditions within the loop, ensuring that the final output is `%d %d\n' % (a, b)**
