Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes, `a` and `b` are updated dynamically based on the divisors in `list_divisors`. In each iteration, `a` and `b` are determined by the divisors that satisfy the conditions specified in the loop code and the swapping logic. The final values of `a` and `b` correspond to the largest divisors that meet the conditions. `nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution, and the final output is written to the standard output as `%d %d`, representing the values of `a` and `b`.***
