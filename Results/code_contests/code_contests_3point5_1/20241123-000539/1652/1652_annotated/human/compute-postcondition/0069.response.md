Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 1, values of `a` and `b` have been adjusted based on the condition, list_divisors has at least 3 elements. The value of `d` is considered in different scenarios: If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `a` and `b`.***
