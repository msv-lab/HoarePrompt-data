Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, but they are assigned values from `list_divisors`. Therefore, after execution, the new values of `a` and `b` are swapped based on their comparison. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` have swapped values from `list_divisors`**
