According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements remaining in the list_divisors starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the third element of list_divisors, `b` is either the value of `d` or the second element of list_divisors based on the conditions provided. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `nb_test` remains 0
- `idx` remains 0
- `a` should be updated to the value of `d`
- `b` should be updated based on the conditions provided in the code snippet
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the value of `d`, `b` is updated based on the conditions**
