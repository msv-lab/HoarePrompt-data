According to the code, the loop can execute if the list_divisors has at least 3 elements. In this case, `nb_test` is 0 does not affect the loop execution, so it remains the same. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `a` needs to be the third element of list_divisors, `b` needs to be the second element of list_divisors, and `idx` should be 0.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a` is the third element of list_divisors, `b` is the second element of list_divisors**
