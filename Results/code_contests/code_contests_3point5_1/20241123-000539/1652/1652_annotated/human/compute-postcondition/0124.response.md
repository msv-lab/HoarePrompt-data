Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are elements from `list_divisors` satisfying the specified conditions. If the next element `d` in `list_divisors` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all other cases, `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
