Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. The previous values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the input stored in `list_divisors`. Therefore, after execution, `a` and `b` will have swapped values if `a` was initially greater than `b`, or they will retain their original values. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `a` and `b` have swapped values if `a` was greater than `b`, otherwise they retain their original values**
