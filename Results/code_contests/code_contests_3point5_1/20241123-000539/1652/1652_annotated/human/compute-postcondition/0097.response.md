Example Answer: 
Variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements of `list_divisors`. Since the initial state is not provided for `list_divisors`, the specific values of `a` and `b` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, and variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, and variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from `list_divisors`**
