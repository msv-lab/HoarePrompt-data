Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` is equal to the value of `d`, `b` is `list_divisors[3]`, the value of `d` is greater than or equal to the value of `b`, and `d` is not divisible by `b`. Additionally, `d` is divisible by `a` and `a` is updated to the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`.***
