Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`. The previous values of `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` are given as 1, 2, and are updated based on the conditions in the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `b` is updated based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 1, `idx` is 2, `a` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `b` is updated based on the conditions in the loop**
