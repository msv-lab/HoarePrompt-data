Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code initializes a list of prime numbers `a` and takes an input `n`.
- It then calculates the value of 2 raised to the power of the nth element of list `a` modulo (2 * (10^9 + 7)), divides it by 2, subtracts 1, and then takes modulo (10^9 + 7) again.
- This logic follows the problem description which requires finding the number zn based on the equation provided.
- Since the code is performing the calculations as described in the problem statement, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct based on the program's logic matching the requirements.
