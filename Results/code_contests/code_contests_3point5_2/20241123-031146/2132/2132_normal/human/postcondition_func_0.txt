The function `func` initializes a list of prime numbers and attempts to calculate a Fibonacci number based on user input. However, there are multiple issues in the provided code:
1. The function does not accept any parameters as indicated in the annotations, but it should accept an integer parameter `n`.
2. The code tries to calculate a Fibonacci number using an incorrect formula and then perform a modulo operation that is syntactically incorrect.
3. The intended functionality of generating a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth Fibonacci number is not achieved due to the incorrect code implementation.
4. The code snippet is missing error handling for invalid inputs or exceptions that might occur during the execution.
Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is inaccurate based on the provided code.
