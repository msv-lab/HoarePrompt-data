Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The issue lies in the line:
```python
print(pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```
The issue here is that the division operation `/ 2` is performed before the modulo operation `% (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, when `n = 3`, the expected output is `15`. However, the program will output `8` because the division operation is performed before the modulo operation, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
