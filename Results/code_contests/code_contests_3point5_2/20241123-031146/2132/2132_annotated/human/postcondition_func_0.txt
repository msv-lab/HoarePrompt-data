The function `func` initializes a list `a` containing a sequence of prime numbers. It then takes user input for `n`, calculates a specific mathematical operation involving `2`, `a[n]`, and a large number, and prints the result modulo another large number. However, the code as it is will raise a SyntaxError due to the incorrect use of the modulo operator outside of the print statement. This means the function does not operate as intended.
