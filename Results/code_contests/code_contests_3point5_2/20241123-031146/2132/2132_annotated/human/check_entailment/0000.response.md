Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a list `a` containing pre-calculated values. It then takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the result using the formula provided in the problem description. The result is printed modulo 1000000007. The formula used in the program correctly calculates the value for a given `n` as per the problem description. The program handles the input within the specified constraints and provides the expected output for all valid inputs.
