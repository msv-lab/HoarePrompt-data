The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `v` and `u`. The parameter constraints are as follows: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Each circle is represented by three space-separated integers x, y, and r, where -10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values at the same time.**

Since the output is not provided, we cannot determine the specific return value of the function `func_3`. However, based on the parameters `v` and `u`, the function likely performs some operations or calculations related to the circles represented by the coordinates and radii provided in `v` and `u`. The function may involve comparisons, calculations, or any other operations based on the circles' properties.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two parameters `v` and `u`, which represent circles with specific coordinates and radii, and perform operations or calculations related to these circles.
