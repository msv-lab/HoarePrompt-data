The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `v`, representing an index in the list `par`. It then checks if the value at index `v` in the list `par` is not equal to `v`. If this condition is met, the function recursively updates the value at index `v` in the `par` list by calling `func_2`. Finally, it returns the updated value of `par[v]`. However, there might be missing logic or edge cases related to how the function handles cases where the value at index `v` in the `par` list is equal to `v, which is not fully covered in the annotations.
