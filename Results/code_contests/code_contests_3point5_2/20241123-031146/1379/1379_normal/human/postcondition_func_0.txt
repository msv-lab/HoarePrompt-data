The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `A` and `B`, where `A` is a matrix. It calculates the difference between `A` and `B`, and then calls the function 'line' with parameters d.x, d.y, and the result of d multiplied by matrix A. The function does not include the actual calculation for obtaining d or the rot() method, which are missing in the provided code.
