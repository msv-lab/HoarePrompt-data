Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with argument `v`, and the return value is used as the key to assign the value of `func_2(u)` to the dictionary `par`. The state of other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3. Each of the following n lines contains three space-separated integers x, y, and r, where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10, representing the center coordinates and radius of a circle. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values simultaneously.
