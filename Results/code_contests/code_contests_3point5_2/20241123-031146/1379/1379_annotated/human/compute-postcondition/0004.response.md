The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `v`. The parameter constraints are that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3. Each of the following `n` lines contains three space-separated integers x, y, and r, where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10, describing a circle. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values at the same time. The function returns the updated value of `par[v]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a parameter `v` and return the updated value of `par[v] based on the input constraints.
