The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `v` and `u`. The parameter constraints are as follows: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3. Each of the following n lines contains three space-separated integers x, y, and r, where -10 <= x, y <= 10 and 1 <= r <= 10, representing the center coordinates and radius of a circle. No two circles have the same x, y, and r values simultaneously.**

The functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept the input parameters `v` and `u` based on the given constraints and relationships. The function does not have a specified return value mentioned in the provided information.
