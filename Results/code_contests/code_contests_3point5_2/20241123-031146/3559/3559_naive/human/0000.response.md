Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program is correct in fulfilling the problem description for all potential cases. The program generates a table of size n x m, where the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is also a square. The function `func_1` calculates the numbers to be placed in each row (or column) such that the sum of squares is a square. The program then prints the table with the calculated values. 

For each potential case of n and m, the program correctly generates the table with numbers not exceeding 10^8 and satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description. Since the program works correctly for all cases, the correctness is **True**.
