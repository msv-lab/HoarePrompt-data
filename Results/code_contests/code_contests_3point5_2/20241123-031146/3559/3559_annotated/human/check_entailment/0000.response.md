Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly generates a table of size n x m, where the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is also a square. The program calculates the values in each row/column based on the input size n and m, ensuring that each number does not exceed 10^8. The program covers all possible cases, including edge cases, and provides a valid output for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.
