Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If x == 1, the program returns a list containing the integer 1. If x == 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If x % 2 == 1, the function returns a list starting with [x / 2 + 1, 2] followed by x-2 number of 1s. If x % 2 != 1, the function returns a list containing x/2 - 1 zeros followed by x-1 ones. The program handles all edge cases and ensures the correctness of the output based on the initial conditions provided.***
