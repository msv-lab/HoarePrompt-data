Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a positive integer x and returns a list based on specific conditions. If x is equal to 1, it returns a list containing the integer 1. If x is equal to 2, it returns the list [3, 4]. If x is odd, it returns a list starting with [x / 2 + 1, 2] followed by x-2 number of 1s. If x is even, it returns a list containing x/2 - 1 zeros followed by x-1 ones. The function covers various edge cases and ensures the correctness of the output based on the initial conditions provided.**
