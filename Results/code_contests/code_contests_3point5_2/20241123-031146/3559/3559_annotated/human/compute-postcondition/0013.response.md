The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. The precondition is that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Based on the value of `x`, the function returns different lists according to the following conditions:
- If x is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1.
- If x is equal to 2, the function returns the list [3, 4].
- If x modulo 2 is equal to 1, the function returns a list starting with [x / 2 + 1, 2] followed by x-2 number of 1s.
- If x modulo 2 is not equal to 1, the function returns a list containing x/2 - 1 zeros followed by x-1 ones.

The program is designed to handle all edge cases and ensures the correctness of the output based on the initial conditions provided.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns a list based on the conditions specified.**
