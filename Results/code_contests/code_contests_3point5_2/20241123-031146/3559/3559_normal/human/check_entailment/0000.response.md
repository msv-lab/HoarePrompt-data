Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the logic to generate a table of size n x m where the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is also a square. The function `func_1` returns lists based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the sum of squares for rows and columns are squares. Additionally, the code restricts the numbers to not exceed 10^8, as required by the problem. The output hints align with the code's functionality, and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not follow the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct in generating a valid table as per the given conditions.
