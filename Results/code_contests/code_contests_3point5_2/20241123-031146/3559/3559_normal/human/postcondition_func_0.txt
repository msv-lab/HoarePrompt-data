The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` and returns different lists based on certain conditions. If x is 1, the function returns [1]. If x is 2, the function returns [3, 4]. If x is an odd number, the function returns a list containing x/2 + 1, 2, and x-2 number of 1's. If x is an even number, the function returns a list consisting of x/2 - 1 times the number 1 followed by x - 1 times the number 1. The function operates within the constraints of 1 <= x <= 100.
