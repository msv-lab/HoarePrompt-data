Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100, and x is not equal to 1. If x == 2, the program returns the list [3, 4]. If x % 2 == 1, the function returns a list containing x/2 + 1, 2, and x-2 number of 1's. If x % 2 != 1, the function returns a list consisting of x/2 - 1 times the number 1 followed by x - 1 times the number 1.***
