The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. The constraints for `x` are that it is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 100. 

After executing the function body, if x == 1, the function returns the list [1]. If x == 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If x is an odd number, the function returns a list containing x/2 + 1, 2, and x-2 number of 1's. If x is an even number, the function returns a list consisting of x/2 - 1 times the number 1 followed by x - 1 times the number 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `x` and return a list based on the conditions mentioned above.
