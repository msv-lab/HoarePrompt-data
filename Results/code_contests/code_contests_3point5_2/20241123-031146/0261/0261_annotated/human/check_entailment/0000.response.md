Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It takes in the four integers representing the number of candies in each bag, sorts them in ascending order, and then checks if it's possible to distribute the bags to Dawid's friends so that both friends receive the same amount of candies. The program checks if the sum of the first and fourth elements is equal to the sum of the second and third elements, or if the sum of the first three elements is equal to the fourth element. If either condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The logic of the program covers all possible scenarios and correctly determines if the bags can be distributed as required.
