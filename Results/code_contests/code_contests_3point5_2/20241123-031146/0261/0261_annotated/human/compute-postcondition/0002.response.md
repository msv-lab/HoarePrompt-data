Example Answer:
Each element in the list `data` is converted to an integer using list comprehension. Assuming the initial values of a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, and 'data' contains the separated components of the alphabet string, the output state after executing the code is: a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i=1,2,3,4; data contains the separated components of the alphabet string converted to integers.
Output State: **a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i=1,2,3,4; data contains the separated components of the alphabet string converted to integers**
