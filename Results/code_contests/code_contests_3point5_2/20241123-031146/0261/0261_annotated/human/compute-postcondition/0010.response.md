Functionality: **The function reads a string input, splits it into integers, sorts them in ascending order, and then checks if the sum of the first and fourth elements equals the sum of the second and third elements, or if the sum of the first three elements equals the fourth element. It prints 'YES' if either condition is met, 'NO' otherwise. The function ensures the input integers are within the range of 1 to 100.**
