Postcondition: ***a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i=1,2,3,4; data contains the separated components of the alphabet string converted to integers sorted in ascending order. If the sum of the first and fourth elements of data is equal to the sum of the second and third elements of data, or the sum of the first three elements of data is equal to the fourth element of data, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. In all cases, the program ensures that the sums of the elements in data either meet the conditions specified in the if part or do not meet them as described in the else part.***
