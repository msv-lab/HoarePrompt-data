The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input values. The function calculates the sum of four integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i=1,2,3,4. The function then returns the result of this summation. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the sum of four integers within the specified range and return the result. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of four integers within the range of 1 to 100 for each integer and returns the result.**
