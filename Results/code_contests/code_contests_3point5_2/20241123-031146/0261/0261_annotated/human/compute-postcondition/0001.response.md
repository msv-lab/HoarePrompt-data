Example Answer:
The `data` variable is assigned the result of splitting the `alphabet` string. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are unknown, but they are integers between 1 and 100. After splitting the `alphabet` string, the `data` variable will contain the individual components of the `alphabet` string separated by spaces. 
Output State: **a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i=1,2,3,4; data contains the separated components of the alphabet string**
