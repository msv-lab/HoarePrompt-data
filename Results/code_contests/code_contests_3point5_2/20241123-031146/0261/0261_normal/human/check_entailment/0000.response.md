Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. It checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted list is equal to the sum of the middle two elements, or if the sum of the first three elements is equal to the fourth element. However, it does not consider all possible combinations of distributing the candies to Dawid's friends. 

For example, if the input is `1 1 1 6`, the code will output 'YES' even though it's not possible to distribute the candies in a way that both friends receive the same amount.

Therefore, the code does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description, leading to an incorrect result.
