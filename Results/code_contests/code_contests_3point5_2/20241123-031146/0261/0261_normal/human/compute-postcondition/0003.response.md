Example Answer:
The `data` list containing integers is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the `data` list are rearranged accordingly. There are no changes to the values of `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4`, and `alphabet`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, `alphabet` is a string input, `data` contains sorted integers.
Output State: **`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, `alphabet` is a string input, `data` contains sorted integers**
