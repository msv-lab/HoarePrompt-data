Example Answer:
The elements in the list `data` are converted to integers using list comprehension. The initial values of the elements in the list `data` are unknown, but after conversion, they become integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, `alphabet` is a string input, `data` contains integers.
Output State: **`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, `alphabet` is a string input, `data` contains integers**
