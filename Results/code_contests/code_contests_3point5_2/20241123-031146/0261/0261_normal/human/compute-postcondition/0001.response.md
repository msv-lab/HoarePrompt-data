Example Answer:
`data` is assigned the result of splitting the `alphabet` string. The values of `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, `alphabet` is a string input, `data` is a list containing the split elements of `alphabet`.
Output State: **`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, `alphabet` is a string input, `data` is a list containing the split elements of `alphabet`**
