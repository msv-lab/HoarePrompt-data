Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string `alphabet`, splits it into integers, sorts them, and then checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted list is equal to the sum of the middle two elements, or if the sum of the first three elements is equal to the fourth element. If either condition is met, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.**
