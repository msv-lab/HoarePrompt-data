The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the parameters a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, which are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The function does not return any values, but it performs a specific operation or task based on the values of a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4 within the specified constraints.
