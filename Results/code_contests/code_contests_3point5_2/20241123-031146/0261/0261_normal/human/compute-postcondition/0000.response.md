Example Answer:
`alphabet` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes input as a string. Since the values of `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are not affected by this code, the output state is: `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, `alphabet` is a string input.
Output State: **`a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, `alphabet` is a string input**
