Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in the input of the number of candies in each bag, sorts them, and then checks if it's possible to distribute the bags in such a way that both friends receive the same amount of candies. It does this by checking if the sum of the smallest and largest bags is equal to the sum of the two middle bags or if the sum of the three smallest bags is equal to the largest bag. This logic covers all possible ways the bags can be distributed to achieve the required condition. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly, it is deemed correct.
