Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input as described in the problem statement, with the first line containing an integer `n` and the second line containing `n` integers.
- The code correctly calculates the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet.
- It uses dictionaries to keep track of the frequency of each number and whether it has been visited before.
- The code iterates through the input array, updating the frequency and visibility of each number, and calculates the sum of unique elements in the list based on the frequency and number of unique elements.
- The final sum is correctly calculated and printed as the output.
- The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
