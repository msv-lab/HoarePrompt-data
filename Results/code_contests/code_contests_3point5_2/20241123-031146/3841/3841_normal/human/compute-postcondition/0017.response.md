Example Answer:
`vis[i]` is assigned the value `0`, where `i` is a key in the dictionary `vis`. The previous values of `n`, `arr`, `freq`, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n+1 integers, freq is a dictionary with key i and value 1, vis is a dictionary with key i and value 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n+1 integers, freq is a dictionary with key i and value 1, vis is a dictionary with key i and value 0**
