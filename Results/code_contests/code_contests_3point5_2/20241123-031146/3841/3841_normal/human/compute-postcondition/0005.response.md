Example Answer:
The code snippet `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` assigns the value of `freq` at key `i` to the result of `freq.get(i, 0)`, which returns the value of `freq` at key `i` if it exists, otherwise it returns 0. Since `freq` is an empty dictionary and `i` is the first element in the list `arr`, which is not provided in the initial state, the value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0, vis is an empty dictionary, i is unknown.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0, vis is an empty dictionary, i is unknown**
