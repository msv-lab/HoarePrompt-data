Example Answer: 
The code snippet updates the value of freq[i], where i is a key in the dictionary freq. If the key i is not present in the dictionary freq, it assigns the value 0 to freq[i]. The initial state includes n as a positive integer, arr as a list of n+1 integers, freq as a dictionary with key i and value 1, and vis as a dictionary with key i and value 0. After executing the code, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n+1 integers, freq is a dictionary with key i and value 1, vis is a dictionary with key i and value 0**
