Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty dictionary `freq`. Since the dictionary is empty, the output state is: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers such that each element is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), freq is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers such that each element is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), freq is an empty dictionary**
