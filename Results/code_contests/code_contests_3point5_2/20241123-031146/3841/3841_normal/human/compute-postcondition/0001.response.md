Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input from the user, splits the input into different parts, converts each part into an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The size of the list `arr` is equal to the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers such that each element is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers such that each element is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive)**
