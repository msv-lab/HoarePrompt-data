According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the list `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with keys representing elements in arr and values modified by subtracting 1, vis is a dictionary with keys representing elements in arr and values set to 0, rem is the number of unique elements in arr - 1 if the frequency of element i is zero, ans is updated by adding rem if vis[i] was not previously set, and vis[i] is set to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that there are more elements left in the `arr` list to iterate over. This means that `n` should be incremented by 1 and the next element in the list should be considered as `i`. 
State: **n is a positive integer where 1 <= n+1 <= 10^5, arr is a list of n+1 integers with at least 2 elements, freq is a dictionary with keys representing elements in arr and values modified by subtracting 1, vis is a dictionary with keys representing elements in arr and values set to 0, rem is the number of unique elements in arr - 1 if the frequency of element i is zero, ans is updated by adding rem if vis[i] was not previously set, and vis[i] is set to 1**
