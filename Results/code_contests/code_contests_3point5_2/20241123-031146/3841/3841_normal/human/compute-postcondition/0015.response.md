According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in the list `arr` to iterate over. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n+1 integers, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value 1, vis is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0**
