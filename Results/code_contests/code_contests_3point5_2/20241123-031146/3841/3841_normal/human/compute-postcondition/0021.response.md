Output State: 
After the loop executes, n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value representing the frequency of each element in arr, vis is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0 for elements that have not been visited before. 
If the loop does not execute (empty arr), freq and vis remain empty dictionaries. 
The loop increments the frequency of each element in arr and sets the corresponding value in vis to 0 if the element has not been visited before.
