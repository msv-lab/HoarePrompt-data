For the loop to execute, the `arr` list must have at least 1 element. Since `n` is the length of `arr`, it is guaranteed that `n` will be a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5. The `freq` dictionary needs to be initialized with keys representing the elements in `arr` and values set to 0 since the elements have not been visited yet. The `vis` dictionary also needs to be initialized with keys representing the elements in `arr` and values set to 0 to indicate that the elements have not been visited. The `rem` variable needs to be set to the number of unique elements in `arr`. After the loop executes, `ans` will remain 0.

State: **n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with keys representing elements in arr and values set to 0, vis is a dictionary with keys representing elements in arr and values set to 0, rem is the number of unique elements in arr, ans is 0**
