Output State: **n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n+1 integers, freq is a dictionary with key i and value 2 (incremented by 1), vis is a dictionary with key i and value 0. If freq[i] is false, then vis[i] is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to vis[i]. This condition covers all possible scenarios for the execution of the if statement.**
