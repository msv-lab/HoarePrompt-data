According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list arr has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the list freq and vis are empty dictionaries. So, for the loop to execute, the list arr must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in the list arr.
State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is an empty dictionary, vis is an empty dictionary, i is the first element in the list arr**
