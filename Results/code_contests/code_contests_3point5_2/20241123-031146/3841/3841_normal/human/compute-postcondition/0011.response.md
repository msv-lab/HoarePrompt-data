Example Answer:
The code snippet `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` updates the value associated with key `i` in the dictionary `freq` to return the value associated with key `i`, or 0 if key `i` is not present in the dictionary. Since the specific value associated with key `i` in freq is 0, the value associated with key `i` in vis is set to 0 as well. The states of other variables remain the same.

Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0, vis is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0**
