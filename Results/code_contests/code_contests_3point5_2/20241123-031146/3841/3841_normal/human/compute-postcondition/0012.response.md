Example Answer:
`vis[i]` is assigned the value 0. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0, vis is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0, vis is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0**
