According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements left in the list `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value 1, vis is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0, and the specific value associated with key `i` in freq is unknown. If the value associated with key `i` in freq is 0, then the value associated with key `i` in vis needs to be adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with key `i` and value 1, vis is a dictionary with key `i` and value 0, and the specific value associated with key `i` in freq is 0, then set the value associated with key `i` in vis to 0**
