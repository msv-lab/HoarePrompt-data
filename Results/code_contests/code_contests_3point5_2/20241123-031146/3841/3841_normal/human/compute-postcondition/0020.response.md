According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n+1 integers, freq is a dictionary with key i and value 2 (incremented by 1), vis is a dictionary with key i and value 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the list `arr` needs to be accessed. This means `n` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2, and the next element in the list needs to be considered.

State: **n is a positive integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, arr is a list of n+1 integers, freq is a dictionary with key i and value 2 (incremented by 1), vis is a dictionary with key i and value 0**
