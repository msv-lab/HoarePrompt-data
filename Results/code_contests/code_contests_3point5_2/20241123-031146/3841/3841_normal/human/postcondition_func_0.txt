The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the sum of unique elements in the list based on the frequency of each element and the number of unique elements. The function prints the final sum as the output. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input for `n` and `arr`.
