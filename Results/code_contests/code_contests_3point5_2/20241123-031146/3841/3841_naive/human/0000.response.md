Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet. It maintains a frequency dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the row and a visited dictionary to keep track of whether a number has been visited or not. The program then iterates through the numbers in the row and calculates the number of possible pairs based on the frequency of each number. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
