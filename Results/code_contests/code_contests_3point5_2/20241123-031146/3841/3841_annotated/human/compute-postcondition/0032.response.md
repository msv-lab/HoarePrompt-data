Postcondition: ***`rem` is the length of the set of integers in list `arr`, `freq` remains a dictionary with key `i` and value -1, `vis` has key `i` with a value of 1, `ans` is incremented by the value of `rem`, `i` is the first element in list `arr`. If the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `freq` is False, then `rem` is decremented by 1. If the value of key `i` in the dictionary `vis` is False, `ans` is increased by `rem` and `vis[i]` is set to 1.***
