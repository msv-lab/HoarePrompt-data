Postcondition: ***`rem` is the length of the set of integers in list `arr`, `freq` remains a dictionary with key `i` and value -1, `vis` remains an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in list `arr`. If the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `freq` is False, then `rem` is decremented by 1.***
