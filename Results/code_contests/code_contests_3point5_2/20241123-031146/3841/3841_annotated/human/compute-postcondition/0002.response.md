Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty dictionary `freq`. It does not affect the initial state variables `n` and `arr`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is the input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `freq` is an empty dictionary**
