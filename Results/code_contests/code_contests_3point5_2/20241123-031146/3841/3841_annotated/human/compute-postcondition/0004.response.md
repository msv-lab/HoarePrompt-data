According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `arr` list. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 element. Additionally, since `freq` is an empty dictionary, it does not affect the loop execution. `vis` being a newly created dictionary also does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is the input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. 
State: **`n` is the input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is a newly created dictionary**
