Postcondition: ***`rem`, `freq`, `vis`, `ans`, `i` are all in valid states. If `vis[i]` is false, `rem` is the length of the set of integers in list `arr` decremented by 1, `freq` has key `i` with a value decremented by 1, `vis` has key `i` with a value of 1, `ans` is incremented by the value of `rem`, and `i` is the next element in list `arr`. Additionally, if `freq[i]` is false, `rem` is decremented by 1, reflecting the case where the frequency of `i` is 0, reducing the length of the set.***
