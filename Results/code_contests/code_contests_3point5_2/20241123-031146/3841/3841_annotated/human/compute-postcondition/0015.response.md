According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list having at least one more element to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. To execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated values where `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1, `vis` is a dictionary where if `freq[i]` was previously 0, `vis[i]` is set to 0, otherwise the state remains unchanged**
