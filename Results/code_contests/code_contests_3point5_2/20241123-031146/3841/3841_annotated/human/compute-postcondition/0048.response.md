Output State: **If the list `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute. If the loop does execute, `rem` will be 0, `freq` will be a dictionary with all keys from `arr` and values decremented by 1 for each occurrence, `vis` will be a dictionary with all keys from `arr` and values set to 1, and `ans` will be the sum of decremented `rem` values for each element in `arr`.**
