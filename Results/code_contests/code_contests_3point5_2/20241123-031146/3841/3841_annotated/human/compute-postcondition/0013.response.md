Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer representing the number of numbers in a row. `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. `freq` is a dictionary with updated values. `vis` is a dictionary with `vis[i]` initialized to 0 if `freq[i]` was previously 0. If `freq[i]` was previously 0, `vis[i]` is set to 0. In all other cases, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
