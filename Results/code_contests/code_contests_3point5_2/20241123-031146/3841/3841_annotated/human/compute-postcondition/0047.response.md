According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements remaining in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `rem`, `freq`, `vis`, `ans`, `i` are adjusted based on the next element in the list `arr`. If `freq[i]` becomes zero after the adjustment, `rem` is decreased by 1 and `freq[i]` is also decreased by 1. If `vis[i]` was previously false, `ans` is increased by `rem` and `vis[i]` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`rem`, `freq`, `vis`, `ans`, `i` are adjusted based on the next element in the list `arr`**
