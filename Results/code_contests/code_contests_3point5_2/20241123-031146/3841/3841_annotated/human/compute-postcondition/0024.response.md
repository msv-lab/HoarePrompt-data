According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `rem` being assigned the length of the set of integers in list `arr` ensures that the loop will execute. So, the states need to be adjusted to `rem` is assigned the length of the set of integers in list `arr`, `freq` and `vis` remain empty dictionaries, `ans` is 0, and `i` is the first element in the list `arr`.
State: **`rem` is assigned the length of the set of integers in list `arr`, `freq` and `vis` remain empty dictionaries, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in list `arr`**
