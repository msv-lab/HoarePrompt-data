Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input in the form of space-separated numbers and converts them into a list of integers stored in the variable `arr`. The variable `n` represents the number of numbers in a row, but it is not directly used in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` is the input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
