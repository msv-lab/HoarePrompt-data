Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `rem`. The values of `rem`, `freq`, `vis`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `rem`, `freq`, `vis`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`rem`, `freq`, `vis`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged**
