Example Answer:
The value of `freq[i]` is assigned the result of `freq.get(i, 0)`, which retrieves the value of key `i` from the dictionary `freq` or returns 0 if the key does not exist. Since `freq` is an empty dictionary, `freq[i]` will be assigned 0. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with `freq[i]` initialized to 0, `vis` is a newly created dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is the input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with `freq[i]` initialized to 0, `vis` is a newly created dictionary**
