Example Answer:
`freq[i]` is assigned the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`, which means if `i` is not in the dictionary `freq`, it will be assigned the default value of 0. The previous state of `freq[i]` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `arr`, and `vis` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated values, `vis` is a dictionary with `vis[i]` initialized to 0 if `freq[i]` was previously 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with updated values, `vis` is a dictionary with `vis[i]` initialized to 0 if `freq[i]` was previously 0**
