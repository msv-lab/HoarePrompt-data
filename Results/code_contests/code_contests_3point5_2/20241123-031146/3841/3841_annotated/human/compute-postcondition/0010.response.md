According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If there are more elements in the list to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with `freq[i]` increased by 1, `vis` is a dictionary with `vis[i]` initialized to 0 if `freq[i]` was previously 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `arr` list must have at least one more element to iterate over. So the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of numbers in a row, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with `freq[i]` increased by 1, `vis` is a dictionary with `vis[i]` initialized to 0 if `freq[i]` was previously 0.**
