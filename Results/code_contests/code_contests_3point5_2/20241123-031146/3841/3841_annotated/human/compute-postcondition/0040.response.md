According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `rem`, `freq`, `vis`, `ans`, `i` are all in valid states. If `vis[i]` is false, `rem` is decremented by 1, `freq` has key `i` with a value decremented by 1, `vis` has key `i` with a value of 1, `ans` is incremented by the value of `rem`, and `i` is the next element in list `arr`. Additionally, if `freq[i]` is false, `rem` is decremented by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `vis[i]` is false, `rem` should be decremented by 1 for the next element in the list.
- If `freq[i]` is false, `rem` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the case where the frequency of `i` is 0.
- `vis[i]` should be updated to reflect that the element `i` has been visited.
- `ans` should be updated by incrementing it with the value of the updated `rem`.
- `i` should be updated to the next element in the list `arr`.

State: **Adjust `rem`, `freq`, `vis`, `ans`, `i` accordingly based on the next element in the list `arr`.**
