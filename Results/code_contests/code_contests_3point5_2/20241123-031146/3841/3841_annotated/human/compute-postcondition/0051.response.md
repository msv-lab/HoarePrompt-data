Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers from the user. It then processes the input list to calculate and print the final output `ans`. The function updates the frequency and visibility of integers in the list and computes the value of `ans` based on certain conditions. If the input list is empty, the processing loops do not execute, and no output is generated.**
