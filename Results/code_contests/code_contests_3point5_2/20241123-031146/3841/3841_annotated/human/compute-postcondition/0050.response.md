The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function reads input from the user consisting of a single integer `n` representing the number of numbers in a row, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the numbers in a row. The function then processes these inputs in an unspecified manner. The function does not return any value.
