Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of elements in the list and the elements themselves.
2. The program correctly calculates the frequency of each integer in the list and initializes the visibility of each integer.
3. The program then iterates through the list and calculates the number of possible pairs that can be given to the robots so that they will not meet.
4. The program handles the case where robots stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.
5. The program outputs the correct number of possible pairs that meet the given criteria.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and seems to work correctly for all potential cases.
