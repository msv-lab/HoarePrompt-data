Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the list of strings obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`. The initial state is `inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
