Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0. `same` contains elements from `temp[0]` or `lol`. `c` is either 0 or 1. `i` is the number of times the loop has executed + 1. `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the next iteration. `count` is 3. `temp` contains either no elements or the appended element `[order[i], order[2]]`. `lol` contains the appended element `temp[0][1]`. `temp` is cleared. `lol` is cleared. `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. Covering all edge cases, the program maintains the integrity of the variables and successfully breaks the loop when the condition is met.***
