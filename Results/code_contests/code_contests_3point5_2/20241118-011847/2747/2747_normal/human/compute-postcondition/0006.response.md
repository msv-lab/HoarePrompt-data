Example Answer:
The value of `a[c]` is appended to the list `order`. The value of `c` is 0, so `a[0]` will be appended to `order`. The value of `a` is obtained by splitting the input, and `i` is 1, so the first element of `a` will be appended to `order`. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `order` contains the first element of list `a`.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `order` contains the first element of list `a`**
