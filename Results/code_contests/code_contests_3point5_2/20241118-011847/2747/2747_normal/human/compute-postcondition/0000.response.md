Example Answer:
`inp` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`. The `split()` method splits the input string into a list of strings. Since the initial state is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `inp` after splitting. Therefore, the output state is `inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
