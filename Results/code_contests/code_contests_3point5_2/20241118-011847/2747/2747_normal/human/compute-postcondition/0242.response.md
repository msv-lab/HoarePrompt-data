Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values, processes them according to specific constraints, and calculates a result based on those constraints. It involves iterating through lists and checking conditions to append elements into another list. Finally, it computes and prints a value that involves the lengths of specific lists and a modulo operation. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on the predefined constraints and relationships provided.**
