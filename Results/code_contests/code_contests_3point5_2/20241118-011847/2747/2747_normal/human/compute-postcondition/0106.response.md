Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is a list containing elements from `temp[0]` or `lol`, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains more elements from list `a` based on the iterations of the loop, `count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 2` or `int(inp[0]) + 1` incremented by 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is a list with the appended element `[order[i], order[count]][1]`, and `lol` is appended with the first element of `temp[0][0]`**
