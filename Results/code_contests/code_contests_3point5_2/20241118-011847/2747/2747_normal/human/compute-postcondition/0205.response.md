Postcondition: ***`same` contains elements from `temp[0]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` equals the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is 1, `temp` contains the appended list `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]`, `temp[0]` or `lol` is not in `same`, length of `same` is less than `inp[1]`, and `lol` is a list containing `temp[0][1], temp[0][0]`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues. If the length of `same` reaches `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `same` is appended with `temp[0]`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
