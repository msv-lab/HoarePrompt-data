Postcondition: ***`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `order` contains the first element of list `a`, `count` is increased by 4, and `count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0]) + 2`. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is set to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is increased by 1.***
