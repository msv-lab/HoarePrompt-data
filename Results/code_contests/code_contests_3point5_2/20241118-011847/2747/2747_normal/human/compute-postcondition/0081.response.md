Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the iterations of the loop, `count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1` or `int(inp[0])`, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0, else `c` is incremented by 1, `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list.**
