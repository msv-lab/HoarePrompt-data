Postcondition: ***`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `order` contains the first element of list `a`, `count` is increased by 1. If `c` is equal to len(a) - 1, `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not equal to len(a) - 1, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is increased by 1.***
