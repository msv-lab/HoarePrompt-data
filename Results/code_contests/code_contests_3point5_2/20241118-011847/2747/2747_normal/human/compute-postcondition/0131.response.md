Output State: **If `inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, the loop will execute at least once. `same` will contain elements from `temp[0]` or `lol`. `c` will be either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution. `i` will be the number of times the loop has executed. `order` will contain elements from list `a` based on the iterations of the loop. `count` will be equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1` or `int(inp[0])`. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` will be reset to 0, else `c` will be incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` will be reset to empty lists, `count` will be incremented by 1. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop will break. Otherwise, `same` will append `temp[0]`.**
