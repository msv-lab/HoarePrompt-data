Example Answer:
`count` is assigned the value 0. The variables `same`, `c`, `i`, `order`, `temp`, and `lol` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `same` contains elements from `temp[0]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` equals the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is 0, `temp` and `lol` are emptied, `temp[0]` or `lol` is not in `same`, length of `same` is less than `inp[1]`.
Output State: **`same` contains elements from `temp[0]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` equals the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is 0, `temp` and `lol` are emptied, `temp[0]` or `lol` is not in `same`, length of `same` is less than `inp[1]`.**
