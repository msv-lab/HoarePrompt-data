Output State: **If `inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, after the loop execution, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` remains an empty list, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` becomes either 0 or 1, `i` remains 1, `order` contains the first element of list `a`, `count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1`, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0, else `c` is incremented by 1.**
