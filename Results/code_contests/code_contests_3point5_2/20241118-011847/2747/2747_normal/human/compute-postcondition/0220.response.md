Postcondition: ***`same` contains elements from `temp[0]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` equals the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. If none of the conditions are met, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
