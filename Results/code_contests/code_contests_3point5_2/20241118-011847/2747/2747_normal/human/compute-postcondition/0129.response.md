Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` contains elements from `temp[0]` or `lol`, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains more elements from list `a` based on the iterations of the loop, `count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 2` or `int(inp[0]) + 1` incremented by 5, `temp` is set to an empty list, `lol` is set to an empty list. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks, `same` appends `temp[0]`, `lol` is set to an empty list, `temp` appends `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]`, `lol` appends `temp[0][0]`.***
