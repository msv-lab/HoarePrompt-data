Output State: If `inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, after the loop execution, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` contains elements from the last appended `temp[0]`, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution, `i` equals the total number of loop executions, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` will be reset to 0, else `c` will be incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, both lists are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` reaches `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. If `inp[0]` is less than 0, the loop does not execute, and the state remains the same as the initial state.
