Output State: **`same` contains elements from `temp[0]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` equals the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is 0, `temp` contains the appended list `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]`, `temp[0]` or `lol` is not in `same`, length of `same` is less than `inp[1]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `inp[1]`, then the loop breaks. `lol` is a list containing `temp[0][1], temp[0][0]` and `same` is appended with `temp[0]`.**
