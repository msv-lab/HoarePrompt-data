Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` has an additional element which is `temp[0]`, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the iterations of the loop, `count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1` or `int(inp[0])`, `temp` contains the pair `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` is a list containing the second element of the pair in `temp`, `lol` contains the first element of the pair in `temp`, and neither `temp[0]` nor `lol` are in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the loop breaks. `temp` is an empty list.**
