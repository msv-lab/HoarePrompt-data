Output State: **If `inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0 and `inp[1]` is a positive integer, the loop will execute. After the loop finishes, `same` contains elements from `temp[0]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` equals the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is incremented to the number of elements in `order`, `temp` and `lol` are emptied. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, both lists are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` reaches `inp[1]`, the loop breaks.**
