Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `same` contains elements from `temp[0]` or `lol` and `temp[0]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed + 1, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the next iteration, `count` is 0, `temp` contains the appended element `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` contains the element `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` appends `temp[0][0]`, the condition `temp[0] in same or lol in same` is false, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks, `temp` is an empty list.**
