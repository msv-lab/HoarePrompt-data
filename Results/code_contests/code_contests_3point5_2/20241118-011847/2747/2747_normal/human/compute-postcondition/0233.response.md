Output State: **`same` contains elements from `temp[0] and newly appended elements, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` equals the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is 3, `temp` contains the newly appended list, `lol` contains the element at index 1 of the first element of `temp`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value in `inp[1]`, then the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables. `temp` contains the newly appended list.**
