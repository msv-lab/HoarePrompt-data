Output State: **If `inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, then after the loop execution, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` remains an empty list, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution, `i` is 2, `order` contains the first element of list `a`, `count` is equal to `int(inp[0])`, and if `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is set to 0. If `inp[0]` is less than 0, the loop does not execute, and the state remains the same as the initial state.**
