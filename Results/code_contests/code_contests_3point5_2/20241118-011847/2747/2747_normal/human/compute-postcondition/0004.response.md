Example Answer:
The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. Since `c` is the only variable affected and its initial value is `0`, the output state is: `inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is an empty list, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is 0**
