Postcondition: ***`same` contains elements from `temp[0]` and possibly newly appended elements, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` equals the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the last iteration, `count` is 4, `temp` is either an empty list or contains the newly appended list, `lol` is either an empty list or contains the element at index 1 of the first element of `temp`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are cleared, `count` is increased by 1. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value in `inp[1]`, then the loop breaks. Otherwise, `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, `count` is increased by 1.***
