Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` is a list containing elements from `temp[0]` or `lol`, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the loop execution, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the iterations of the loop, `count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 2` or `int(inp[0]) + 1`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list. The program enters the if condition if `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the loop breaks. Otherwise, `same` appends `temp[0]`, `count` is incremented by 1, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists.***
