Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `same` contains elements from `temp[0]` or `lol`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed + 1, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the next iteration, `count` is either 7 or 8. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. In the end, `temp` is emptied, `lol` is emptied, and `same` contains elements from `temp[0]`.***
