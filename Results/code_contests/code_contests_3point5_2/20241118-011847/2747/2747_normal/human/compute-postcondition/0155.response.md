Output State: **`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `same` contains elements from `temp[0]` or `lol`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed + 1, `order` contains elements from list `a` based on the next iteration, `count` is 3, `temp` contains either no elements or the appended element `[order[i], order[2]]`, `lol` contains the appended element `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` appends either `temp[0][0]` or is an empty list. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` is cleared, `lol` is cleared, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks, and `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. In both cases, `count` is incremented by 1 after the operation.**
