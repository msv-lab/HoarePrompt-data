Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` remains an empty list, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. If c is equal to len(a) - 1, then `c` is set to 0 and `count` is increased by 1. If c is not equal to len(a) - 1, then `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is increased by 1. In both cases, `i` remains 2 and `order` contains the first element of list `a`.***
