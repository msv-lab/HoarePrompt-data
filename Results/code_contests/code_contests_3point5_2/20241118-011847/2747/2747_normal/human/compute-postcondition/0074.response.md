Postcondition: ***`inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, `inp` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `same` remains an empty list, `a` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is an integer that has been updated based on the conditions. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `c` is set to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is also incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` remains 2, `order` contains the first element of list `a`, and `count` is always less than or equal to `int(inp[0])`.***
