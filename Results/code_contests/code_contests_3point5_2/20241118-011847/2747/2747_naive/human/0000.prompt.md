You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Duff was resting in the beach, she accidentally found a strange array b0, b1, ..., bl - 1 consisting of l positive integers. This array was strange because it was extremely long, but there was another (maybe shorter) array, a0, ..., an - 1 that b can be build from a with formula: bi = ai mod n where a mod b denoted the remainder of dividing a by b.

<image>

Duff is so curious, she wants to know the number of subsequences of b like bi1, bi2, ..., bix (0 ≤ i1 < i2 < ... < ix < l), such that: 

  * 1 ≤ x ≤ k
  * For each 1 ≤ j ≤ x - 1, <image>
  * For each 1 ≤ j ≤ x - 1, bij ≤ bij + 1. i.e this subsequence is non-decreasing. 



Since this number can be very large, she want to know it modulo 109 + 7.

Duff is not a programmer, and Malek is unavailable at the moment. So she asked for your help. Please tell her this number.

Input

The first line of input contains three integers, n, l and k (1 ≤ n, k, n × k ≤ 106 and 1 ≤ l ≤ 1018).

The second line contains n space separated integers, a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109 for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 

Output

Print the answer modulo 1 000 000 007 in one line.

Examples

Input

3 5 3
5 9 1


Output

10


Input

5 10 3
1 2 3 4 5


Output

25

Note

In the first sample case, <image>. So all such sequences are: <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image> and <image>.
Program:
```
inp = raw_input().split()
order = []
same = []
a = raw_input().split()
c = 0
for i in range(int(inp[1])):
    order.append(a[c])
    count = 0
    while count <= int(inp[0]):
        if c == len(a) - 1:
            c = 0
            count = count + 1
        else:
            c = c + 1
            count = count + 1
for i in range(len(order)):
    count = 0
    temp = []
    lol = []
    while count <= len(order) - 1:
        temp.append([order[i], order[count]])
        lol.append(temp[0][1])
        lol.append(temp[0][0])
        if temp[0] in same or lol in same:
            temp = []
            lol = []
            count = count + 1
            pass
        else:
            if len(same) == int(inp[1]):
                break
            same.append(temp[0])
            temp = []
            lol = []
            count = count + 1
print(len(same) + len(order)) % (pow(10, 9) + 7)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
