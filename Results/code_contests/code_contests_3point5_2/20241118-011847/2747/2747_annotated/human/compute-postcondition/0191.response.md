Example Answer:
The value at `temp[0][0]` is appended to the list `lol`. Therefore, the value at `temp[0][0]` is added to the `lol`. The values of `count`, `same`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains the value from temp[0][1]**
