Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, and the previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` appends the second element of `order[i]`, `lol` appends the first element of the first element of `temp`.
Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` appends the second element of `order[i]`, `lol` appends the first element of the first element of `temp`**
