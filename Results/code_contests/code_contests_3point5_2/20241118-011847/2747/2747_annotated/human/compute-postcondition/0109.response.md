Postcondition: ***`inp`, `order`, `same`, `a`, `c`, `count`, `temp`, `lol` are variables with specific initial values and relationships. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value at `inp[1]`, the program breaks out of the loop. The variables are updated according to the conditions specified in the program fragment. The overall state of the program after the execution of the if-else block ensures that the variables retain their initial relationships and values, with adjustments made based on the condition in the if statement.***
