Output State: **If `len(order)` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop finishes, `same` will be adjusted based on the conditions in the code. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `[b, a]` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` will be empty lists, `count` will be increased by 2. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop will terminate. If neither condition is met, the element `temp[0]` will be appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` will be empty lists, `count` will be increased by 2.**
