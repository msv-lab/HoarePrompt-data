Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned an empty list. The previous value of `count` is 3, `temp` had a new list with `order[i]` and `order[3]`, and `lol` had the second element of `order[3]` appended with the additional element `temp[0][0]`. After execution, `temp` is an empty list, and the states of `count` and `lol` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` has the second element of `order[3]` appended with the additional element `temp[0][0]`**
