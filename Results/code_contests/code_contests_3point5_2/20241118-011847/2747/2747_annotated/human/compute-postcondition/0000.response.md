Example Answer:
The `inp` variable is assigned the list of strings obtained by splitting the input. Since we do not have any information about the input values or the previous state, we can only say that the `inp` variable now contains the list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
