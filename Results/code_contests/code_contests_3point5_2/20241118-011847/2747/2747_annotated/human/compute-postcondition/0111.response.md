Example Answer:
`temp` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp`, `order`, `same` has `temp[0]` appended, `a`, `c`, `count`, `temp`, `lol` retain their initial values and relationships, `temp` is an empty list.
Output State: **`inp`, `order`, `same` has `temp[0]` appended, `a`, `c`, `count`, `temp`, `lol` retain their initial values and relationships, `temp` is an empty list**
