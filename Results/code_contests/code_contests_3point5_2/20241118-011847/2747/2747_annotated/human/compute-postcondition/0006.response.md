Example Answer: 
`order` is appended with the value of `a[c]`, where `a` is the same as `inp` and `c` is 0. Since `inp` is a list of strings and `c` is 0, `a[c]` will be the first element of `inp`. Therefore, `order` will now contain the first element of `inp`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input with at least 2 elements, `order` contains the first element of `inp`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is set to `inp`, `c` is 0**
