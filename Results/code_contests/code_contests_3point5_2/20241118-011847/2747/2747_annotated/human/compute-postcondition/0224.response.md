Example Answer:
`lol` has the second element of `order[3]` appended with the additional element `temp[0][0]`. The previous values of the variables are `count` is 3, `temp` has a new list with `order[i]` and `order[3]`, `lol` has the second element of `order[3]` appended. After executing the code, the new value of `lol` will have the second element of `order[3]` with the additional element from `temp[0][0]`.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `temp` has a new list with `order[i]` and `order[3]`, `lol` has the second element of `order[3]` appended with the additional element `temp[0][0]`**
