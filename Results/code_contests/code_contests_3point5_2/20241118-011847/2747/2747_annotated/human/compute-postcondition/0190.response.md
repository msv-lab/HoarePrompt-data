Example Answer:
The value at index 0, position 1 of list `temp` is appended to the list `lol`. The previous values of the variables are not specified, so the output state is: `count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains the value from temp[0][1].
Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains the value from temp[0][1]**
