Example Answer:
`temp` is a list to which a new list `[order[i], order[count]]` is appended. The values of `order[i]` and `order[count]` are determined by the current state of the program. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is a list containing the appended list `[order[i], order[count]]`.
Output State: **`temp` is a list containing the appended list `[order[i], order[count]]`**
