Example Answer: 
`temp` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `temp` and `lol` are affected by this code snippet. Since `temp` is empty, it remains empty after this operation. The value of `lol` is not provided, so it remains unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` value is unknown.
Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` value is unknown**
