Example Answer:
The list `order` is initialized as an empty list. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `order` is an empty list.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `order` is an empty list**
