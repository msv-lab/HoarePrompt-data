Postcondition: ***`inp` remains unchanged, `order` contains the first element of `inp` and either the last element of `a` if c was at the end of the list or the appended element `a[c]` if c was not at the end, `same` stays empty, `a` remains unchanged, `c` is adjusted based on the length of `a` (either reset to 0 if it was at the end or incremented by 1 if it was not at the end), `count` is increased by 1. This postcondition covers all cases including the scenario where c is at the end of the list and when it is not, ensuring the correct update of variables after the execution of the if-else block.***
