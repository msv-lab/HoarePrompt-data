Postcondition: ***`count` is 3, `temp` contains a new list with elements `order[i]` and `order[3]`, `lol` has the second element of `order[3]` appended with the additional element `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables `count`, `temp`, and `lol`.***
