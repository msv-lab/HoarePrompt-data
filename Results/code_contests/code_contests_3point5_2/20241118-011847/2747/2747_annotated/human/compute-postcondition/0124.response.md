Postcondition: ***`inp` remains unchanged, `order` consists of elements from `a`, `same` is adjusted accordingly, `temp` might be updated, `lol` has a new element appended, `count` is increased by 1 if necessary. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value at index 1 of `inp`, then the program execution stops.***
