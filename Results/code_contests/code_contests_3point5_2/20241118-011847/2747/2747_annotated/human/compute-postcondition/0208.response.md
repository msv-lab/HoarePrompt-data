Example Answer:
`temp` is a list that appends `[order[i], order[1]]`, and `count` is 1. The code appends the second element of the first element of `temp` to the list `lol`. Since `temp` is `[order[i], order[1]]`, `temp[0][1]` refers to the second element of the first element of `temp`. Therefore, the second element of `order[i]` is appended to `lol`. 
Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` appends `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` appends the second element of `order[i]`**
