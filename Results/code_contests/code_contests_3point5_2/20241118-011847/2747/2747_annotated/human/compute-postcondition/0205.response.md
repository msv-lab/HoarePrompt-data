Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer with the value of 1. `same` is adjusted based on conditions. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1, and the program continues. If `temp[0]` and `lol` are not in `same`, and the length of `same` is not equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, `same` is appended with the value of `temp[0]`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1, and the program continues.***
