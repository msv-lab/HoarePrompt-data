Example Answer: 
The value `temp[0][0]` is appended to the list `lol`. The initial state indicates that `temp` contains the appended list `[order[i], order[count]` and `lol` contains the value of `order[i][1]`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `temp[0][0]` is added to `lol`.
Output State: **`temp` is a list containing the appended list `[order[i], order[count]`, `lol` is a list containing the value of `order[i][1]` with the addition of `temp[0][0]`**
