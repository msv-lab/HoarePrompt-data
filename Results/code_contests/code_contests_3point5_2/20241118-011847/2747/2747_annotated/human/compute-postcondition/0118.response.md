Example Answer:
A new element from the first element of the first element of `temp` is appended to `lol`. This means a new element is added to `lol`. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`inp` remains unchanged, `order` consists of elements from `a`, `same` is adjusted accordingly, `temp` might be updated, `lol` has a new element appended, `count` is increased by 1 if necessary**
