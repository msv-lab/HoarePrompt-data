Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains the value from `temp[0][1]`, the values in `temp[0]` and `lol` are not present in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
