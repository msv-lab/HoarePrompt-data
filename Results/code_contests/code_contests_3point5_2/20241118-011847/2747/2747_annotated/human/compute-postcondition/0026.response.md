Postcondition: ***inp is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input with at least 2 elements; order contains the first element of inp; same is an empty list; a is set to inp; c is adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above; count is incremented accordingly to satisfy the loop condition. If c == len(a) - 1, c is reset to 0 and count is increased by 1. Otherwise, c is incremented by 1 and count is increased by 1. In both cases, all variables maintain their initial values and relationships, ensuring the loop condition is met and the program state is correctly updated with each iteration.***
