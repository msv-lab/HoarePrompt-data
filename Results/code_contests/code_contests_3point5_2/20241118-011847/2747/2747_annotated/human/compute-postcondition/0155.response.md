Example Answer:
`lol` is a list containing the appended list `[order[i], order[count]]`, and `temp` is a list containing the appended list `[order[i], order[count]]`. `temp[0][1]` accesses the second element of the first list in `temp`, which is `order[i][1]`. After executing the code, the value of `order[i][1]` is appended to `lol`. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is a list containing the appended list `[order[i], order[count]`, `lol` is a list containing the value of `order[i][1]`.
Output State: **`temp` is a list containing the appended list `[order[i], order[count]`, `lol` is a list containing the value of `order[i][1]`**
