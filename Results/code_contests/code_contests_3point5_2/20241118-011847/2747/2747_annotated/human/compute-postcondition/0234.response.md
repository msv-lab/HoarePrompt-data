Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1, so `count` becomes 4. The values of `temp`, `lol`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 4, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` has `temp[0]` appended.
Output State: **`count` is 4, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` has `temp[0]` appended**
