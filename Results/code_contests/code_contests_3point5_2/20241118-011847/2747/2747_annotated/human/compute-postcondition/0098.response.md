Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: The list `lol` is defined as an empty list, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **The list `lol` is defined as an empty list, `count` is increased by 1**
