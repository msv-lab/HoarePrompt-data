Postcondition: ***`temp` is a list containing the appended list `[order[i], order[count]`, `lol` is a list containing the value of `order[i][1]` with the addition of `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value in `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `temp` and `lol`.***
