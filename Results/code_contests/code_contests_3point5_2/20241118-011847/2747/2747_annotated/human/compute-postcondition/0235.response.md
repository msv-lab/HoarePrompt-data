Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer with the value 4, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1 and the program execution proceeds. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the program breaks. If neither condition is met, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, with `count` incremented by 1.***
