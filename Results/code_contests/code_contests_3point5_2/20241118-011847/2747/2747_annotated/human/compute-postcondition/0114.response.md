Postcondition: ***`inp` remains unchanged, `order` consists of elements from `a`, `same` is adjusted accordingly. If `temp[0]` or `lol` are present in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `inp[1]`, the loop terminates. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is increased by 1.***
