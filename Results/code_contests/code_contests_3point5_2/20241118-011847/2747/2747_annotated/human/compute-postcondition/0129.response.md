Postcondition: ***`inp`, `order`, `same`, `temp`, `lol`, `count` are all variables. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value at index 1 of `inp`, the program execution stops. If neither condition is met, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `count` is increased by 1. In all cases, `inp` remains unchanged, `order` consists of elements from `a`, and `lol` has a new element appended if applicable.***
