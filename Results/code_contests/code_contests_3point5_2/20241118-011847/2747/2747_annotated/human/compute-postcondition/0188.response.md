Example Answer:
`lol` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
