Output State: **The loop will execute at least once if the first element of `inp` is greater than 0. After the loop, `inp` will remain unchanged, `order` will contain elements from `a`, `same` will be adjusted accordingly. If `temp[0]` or `lol` are found in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` will be reset to empty lists, `count` will be incremented by 1. If the length of `same` equals the integer value at index 1 of `inp`, the loop will break. Otherwise, `temp[0]` will be appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` will be reset to empty lists, and `count` will be increased by 1.**
