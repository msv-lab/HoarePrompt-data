Example Answer:
`lol` is initialized as an empty list. Since it was not defined previously, it is created as an empty list. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `same` is adjusted based on conditions in the code, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`same` is adjusted based on conditions in the code, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is 0**
