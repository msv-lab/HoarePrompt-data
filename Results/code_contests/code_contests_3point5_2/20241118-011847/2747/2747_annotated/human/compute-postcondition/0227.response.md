Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1, where the previous value of `count` is 3. After execution, `count` becomes 4. The states of `temp` and `lol` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 4, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`count` is 4, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
