Postcondition: ***`temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains [b, a], `count` is increased by 2. If temp[0] is in `same` or `[b, a]` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, `count` is increased by 2. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the loop terminates. If neither condition is met, the element `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, `count` is increased by 2.***
