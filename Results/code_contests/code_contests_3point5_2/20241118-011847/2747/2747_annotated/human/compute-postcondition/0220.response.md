Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. If none of the above conditions are met, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `same` appends `temp[0]`, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
