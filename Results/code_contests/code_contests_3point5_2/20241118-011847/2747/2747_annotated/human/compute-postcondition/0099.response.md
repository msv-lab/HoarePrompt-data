Postcondition: ***The first element of `inp` is greater than 0, `inp` remains unchanged, `order` consists of elements from `a`, `same` is an empty list, `a` is assigned the value of `inp`, `c` is determined by the length of `a`, `count` is increased by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset, `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` equals the integer value of the second element of `inp`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the first element of `temp` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset, and `count` is increased by 1.***
