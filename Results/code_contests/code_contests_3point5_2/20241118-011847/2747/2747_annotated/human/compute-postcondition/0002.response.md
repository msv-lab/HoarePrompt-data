Example Answer:
`same` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `order` is an empty list, `same` is an empty list.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `order` is an empty list, `same` is an empty list**
