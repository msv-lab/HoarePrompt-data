Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is increased by 1**
