Output State: 
if `inp[0]` is greater or equal to 0, the loop will execute at least once and update `order` to contain the first element of `inp` and either the last element of `a` if `c` was at the end of the list or the appended element `a[c]` if `c` was not at the end. `same` will remain empty, `a` will be unchanged, `c` will be adjusted based on the length of `a` (reset to 0 if at the end, incremented by 1 if not), `count` will be increased by 1. If `inp[0]` is negative, the loop will not execute and the variables will remain as they were in the initial state.
