Postcondition: ***`temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains `[b, a]`, `count` is increased by 1. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
