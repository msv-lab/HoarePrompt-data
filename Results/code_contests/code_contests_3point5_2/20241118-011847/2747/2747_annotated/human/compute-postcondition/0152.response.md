Postcondition: ***`same` is adjusted based on conditions in the code. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` is set to an empty list, `lol` is set to an empty list, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program terminates. If neither condition is met, `same` appends `temp[0]`, `temp` is set to an empty list, `lol` is set to an empty list, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
