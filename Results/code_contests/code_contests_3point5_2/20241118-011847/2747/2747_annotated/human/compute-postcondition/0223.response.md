Example Answer:
The value at index 0 of the list `temp` is `order[i]`, which is `order[3]`. Therefore, `temp[0][1]` is the second element of `order[3]`. This value is appended to the list `lol`. As a result, the output state is: `count` is 3, `temp` has a new list with `order[i]` and `order[3]`, `lol` has the second element of `order[3] appended.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `temp` has a new list with `order[i]` and `order[3]`, `lol` has the second element of `order[3] appended**
