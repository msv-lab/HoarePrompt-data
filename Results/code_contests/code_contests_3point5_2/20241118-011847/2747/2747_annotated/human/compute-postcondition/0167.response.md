Postcondition: ***`temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` is a list containing the value of `order[i][1]` with the addition of `temp[0][0]`. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` become empty lists, `count` is increased by 1. If `len(same)` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program exits. Otherwise, `temp` and `lol` become empty lists, `count` is increased by 1, and `temp[0]` is appended to `same`.***
