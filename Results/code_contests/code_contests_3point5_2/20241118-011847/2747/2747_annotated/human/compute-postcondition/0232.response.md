Example Answer: 
The list `temp` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `count`, `temp`, `lol`, and `same` are retained as mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` has the second element of `order[3]` appended with the additional element `temp[0][0]`, `same` has `temp[0]` appended.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` has the second element of `order[3]` appended with the additional element `temp[0][0]`, `same` has `temp[0]` appended**
