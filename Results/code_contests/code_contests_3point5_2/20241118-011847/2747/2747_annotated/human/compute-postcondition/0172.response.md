Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned an empty list. The previous value of `temp` is the appended list, so after execution, `temp` becomes an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains `[b, a]`, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains `[b, a]`, `count` is increased by 1**
