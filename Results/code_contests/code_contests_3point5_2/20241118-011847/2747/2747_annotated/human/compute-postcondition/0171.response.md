Example Answer:
The value at index 0 of the list stored in `temp` is appended to the list stored in `lol`. The previous state shows that `temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains `[b]`, and `count` is increased by 1. After executing the code, the output state is: `temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains `[b, a]`, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains `[b, a]`, `count` is increased by 1**
