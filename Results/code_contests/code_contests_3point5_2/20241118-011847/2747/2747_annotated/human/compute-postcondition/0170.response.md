Example Answer:
The code appends the second element of the first sublist in `temp` to the list `lol`. If `temp` contains the sublist `[[a, b], [c, d]]`, then after execution, `lol` will have the value `[b]`. The `count` variable is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains `[b]`, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains `[b]`, `count` is increased by 1**
