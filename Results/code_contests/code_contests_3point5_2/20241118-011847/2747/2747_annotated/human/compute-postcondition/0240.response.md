Output State: **If the loop executes, `inp` remains the same, `order` will contain elements from `a`, `same` will be a list of unique pairs from `order` based on loop conditions. `temp` and `lol` will be empty lists initially. If `temp[0]` or `[b, a]` is found in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` equals the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, with `count` incremented by 1. Finally, the expression `print(len(same) + len(order)) % (pow(10, 9) + 7)` is calculated and printed.**
