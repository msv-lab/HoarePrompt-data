Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` contains the appended list, `lol` contains the value from temp[0][1]. The values in temp[0] and lol are not present in same. The length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in inp[1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
