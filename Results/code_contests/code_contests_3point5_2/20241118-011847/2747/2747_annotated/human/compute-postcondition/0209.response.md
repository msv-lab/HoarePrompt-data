Example Answer:
The value of `lol` appends the first element of the first element of `temp`, which is `temp[0][0]`. The previous values of the variables are known, `count` is 1, `temp` appends `[order[i], order[1]]`, and `lol` appends the second element of `order[i]`. After execution, `lol` will have the first element of the first element of `temp` appended to it.
Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` appends `[order[i], order[1]]`, `lol` appends the second element of `order[i]`, `lol` appends the first element of the first element of `temp`**
