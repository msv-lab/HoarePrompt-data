Postcondition: ***if inp[0] is greater or equal to 0, `order` contains the first element of `inp`, and `order` has the appended element from `a[c]`. If c is equal to len(a) - 1, then `c` is set to 0, `count` is increased by 3, and `count` is 0. If c is not equal to len(a) - 1, then `c` is increased by 1, `count` is increased by 3, and `count` is 0. In both cases, `same` remains empty, `a` remains unchanged, and the state of the variables is consistent throughout the execution of the program.***
