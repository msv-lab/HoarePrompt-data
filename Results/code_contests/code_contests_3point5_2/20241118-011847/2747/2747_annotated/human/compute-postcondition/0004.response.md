Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `order` is an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `a` is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `order` is an empty list, `same` is an empty list, `a` is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `c` is 0**
