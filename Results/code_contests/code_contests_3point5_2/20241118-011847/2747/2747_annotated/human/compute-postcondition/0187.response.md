Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned an empty list. The previous value of `temp` was also an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is adjusted based on conditions, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
