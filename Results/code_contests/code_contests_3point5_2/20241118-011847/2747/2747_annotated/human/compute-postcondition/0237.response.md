Output State: **`count` is an integer representing the number of iterations completed. `same` is a list containing unique pairs from `order` based on conditions. `temp` is an empty list. `lol` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value stored in `inp[1]`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, with `count` incremented by 1.**
