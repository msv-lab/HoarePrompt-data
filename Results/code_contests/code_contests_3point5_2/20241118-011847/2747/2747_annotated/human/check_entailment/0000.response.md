Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the problem description. The logic in the program does not accurately calculate the number of subsequences of array b that satisfy the given conditions. Additionally, the program contains syntax errors such as using `raw_input()` instead of `input()` in Python 3.

An example of the incorrect behavior of the program:
Input:
3 5 3
5 9 1

Expected Output:
10

Actual Output:
0

Therefore, based on the provided example, the program does not produce the correct output as per the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is **False**.
