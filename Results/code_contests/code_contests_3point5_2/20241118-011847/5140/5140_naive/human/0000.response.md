Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to simulate the explosion of bombs on a plane as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` recursively triggers the explosion of neighboring bombs when a bomb explodes, and updates the state of the plane accordingly. The program iterates through all datasets, reads the input correctly, triggers the explosion based on the given coordinates, and prints the final state of the plane for each dataset. 

I have reviewed the program and couldn't find any case where the program would fail to achieve the expected output based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is considered true.
