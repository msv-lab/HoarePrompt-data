Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program implements the logic as described in the problem description. It recursively explodes the bombs in the neighboring squares when a bomb explodes. The program handles the edge cases when the coordinates are at the boundaries of the plane. The output format also matches the expected output format. Overall, the program seems to correctly simulate the bomb explosions on the plane.
