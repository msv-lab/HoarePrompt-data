Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It recursively simulates the chain reaction caused by a bomb explosion by updating the state of the plane based on the blast radius. The program handles the explosive chain reaction in all directions (above, below, left, and right) by updating the state of adjacent squares with bombs. The recursive function ensures that all affected bombs are detonated in a chain reaction. The implementation covers all possible cases and correctly outputs the final state of the plane after the bomb explosion.
