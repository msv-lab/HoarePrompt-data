Example Answer:
The value of `start` is calculated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than 3, `start` is assigned the value of `x - 3`. If `x` is less than or equal to 3, `start` is assigned the value of 0. The variable `surface` representing the 2D list and the coordinates of the exploded bomb are not affected by this calculation.
Output State: **surface is a 2D list representing the plane with bombs, the bomb at coordinates (x, y) has exploded, start is a calculated value based on x**
