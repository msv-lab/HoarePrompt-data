According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. If `i` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a certain position, and `start` and `end` are the initial and final positions of the loop respectively. To execute one more time, `i` should be less than `end`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be incremented by 1.
State: **If the bomb at position (i+1, y) on the surface has exploded within the calculated range, then func_1(surface, i+1, y) is executed. In all other cases, there are no changes to the surface list.**
