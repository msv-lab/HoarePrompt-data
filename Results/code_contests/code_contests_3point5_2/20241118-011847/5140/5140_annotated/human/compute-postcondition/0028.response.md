Output State: **`start` is equal to `y` and `end` is equal to `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or `end` is equal to 8 if `y + 4` is greater than or equal to 8. If `surface[i][x]` is true, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called. The loop will execute at least once if `start` is less than `end` and if `surface[i][x]` is true. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute.**
