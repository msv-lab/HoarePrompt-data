Example Answer: 
The value of `start` is calculated based on the value of `y`. If `y` is greater than 3, `start` is assigned the value of `y - 3`, otherwise, it is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is calculated based on the value of `y`.
Output State: **`start` is calculated based on the value of `y`**
