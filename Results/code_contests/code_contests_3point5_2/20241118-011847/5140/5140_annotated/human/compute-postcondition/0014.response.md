Output State: *If there are bombs within the calculated range (from start to end) at positions (i, y) and (i+1, y) on the surface, then func_1(surface, i, y) and func_1(surface, i+1, y) are executed, respectively. In all other cases, there are no changes to the surface list. If start is equal to or greater than end, or if y is out of the bounds of the surface list, the loop does not execute, and there are no changes to the surface list.*
