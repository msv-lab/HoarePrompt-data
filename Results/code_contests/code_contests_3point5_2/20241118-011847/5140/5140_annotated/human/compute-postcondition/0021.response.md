According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and the truth value of `surface[i][x]`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to `y` and `end` is equal to `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or `end` is equal to 8 if `y + 4` is greater than or equal to 8. If `surface[i][x]` is true, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
1. If the loop is to execute one more time, the condition `i < end` must be satisfied. Therefore, `end` should be incremented by 1.
2. Since `surface[i][x]` determines the execution of `func_1`, the truth value of `surface[i][x]` should be considered for the next iteration. If `surface[i][x]` is true for the next iteration, `func_1(surface, x, i)` will be called.

State: **`start` is equal to `y` and `end` is equal to `y + 5` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or `end` is equal to 8 if `y + 4` is greater than or equal to 8. If `surface[i][x]` is true, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called.**
