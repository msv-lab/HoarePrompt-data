According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to `y` and `end` is equal to `y + 5` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or `end` is equal to 8 if `y + 4` is greater than or equal to 8. If the loop is to execute one more time, then `end` needs to be adjusted. If `y + 4` is less than 8, then `end` should be `y + 6`, otherwise, `end` should be 9. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`start` is equal to `y` and `end` is equal to `y + 6` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or `end` is equal to 9 if `y + 4` is greater than or equal to 8**
