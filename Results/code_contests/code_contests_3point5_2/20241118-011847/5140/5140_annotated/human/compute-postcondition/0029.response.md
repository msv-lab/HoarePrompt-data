The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. 
**Precondition**: `surface` is a 2D list representing the plane with bombs. `x` and `y` are integers representing the coordinates of the first bomb to explode. The values of `x` and `y` are such that 1 <= x, y <= 8.
The function does not return any specific output in the given constraints.
