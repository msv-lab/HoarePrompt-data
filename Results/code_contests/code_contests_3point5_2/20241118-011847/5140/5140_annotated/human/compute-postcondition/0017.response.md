According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop can execute if `start` is less than `end`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
- If `y` is such that `y + 4` is less than 8, `start` should be set to `y` and `end` should be set to `y + 4`.
- If `y` is such that `y + 4` is greater than or equal to 8, `start` should be set to `y` and `end` should be set to 8.

State: **`start` is equal to `y`, `end` is equal to `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or `end` is equal to 8 if `y + 4` is greater than or equal to 8**
