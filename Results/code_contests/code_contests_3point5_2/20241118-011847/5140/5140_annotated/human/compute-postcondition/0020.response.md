Postcondition: ***`start` is equal to `y` and `end` is equal to `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or `end` is equal to 8 if `y + 4` is greater than or equal to 8. If `surface[i][x]` is true, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called. All conditions of `start`, `end`, and the execution of `func_1` are dependent on the truth value of `surface[i][x]`.***
