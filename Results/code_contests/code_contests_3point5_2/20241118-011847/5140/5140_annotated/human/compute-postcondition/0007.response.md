According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `end`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `end`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **surface is a 2D list representing the plane with bombs. If the bomb at position (i, y) on the surface has exploded within the calculated range, then func_1(surface, i, y) is executed. There are no other changes to the surface list.**
