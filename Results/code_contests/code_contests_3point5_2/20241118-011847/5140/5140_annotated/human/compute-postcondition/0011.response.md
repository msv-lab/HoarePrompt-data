Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with arguments `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If the bomb at position (i+1, y) on the surface has exploded within the calculated range, then the function `func_1` is executed with those arguments. Otherwise, there are no changes to the surface list.
Output State: **No changes to the initial state**
