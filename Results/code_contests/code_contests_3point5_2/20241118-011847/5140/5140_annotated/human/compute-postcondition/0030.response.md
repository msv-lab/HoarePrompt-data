Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes in three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. It modifies the `surface` by setting the value at coordinates (x, y) to 0, then iterates over a specific range of x and y values, calling itself recursively if there are bombs present at adjacent positions on the surface. The function does not have a return value. The code does not cover any edge cases or missing functionality related to boundaries or other potential scenarios.**
