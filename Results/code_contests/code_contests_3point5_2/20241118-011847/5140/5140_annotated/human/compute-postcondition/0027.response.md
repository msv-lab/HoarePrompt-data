According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to `y` and `end` is equal to `9`. To execute the loop one more time, `end` needs to be adjusted to `10`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`start` is equal to `y` and `end` is equal to `10`**
