According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the start value is less than the end value. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that start is less than end in order for the loop to execute. Additionally, since the bomb at coordinates (x, y) has exploded, the start value should be set based on x. 
State: **surface is a 2D list representing the plane with bombs, the bomb at coordinates (x, y) has exploded, start is calculated based on x, end is either x + 4 or 8, start is less than end**
