Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y`. Inside the function, the bomb at position (i, y) will explode. The start position for the explosion will be calculated based on the value of `i`. The end position will be either `i + 4` or `8`, and start will always be less than end. Therefore, the bomb at position (i, y) will explode in the range determined by the start and end positions.
Output State: **The bomb at position (i, y) on the surface has exploded within the calculated range**
