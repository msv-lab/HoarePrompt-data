According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `end`. At the end of the last iteration, if the bomb at position `(i+1, y)` has exploded within the calculated range, then `func_1(surface, i+1, y)` is executed. In all other cases, there are no changes to the surface list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `end`.
State: **If the bomb at position (end, y) on the surface has exploded within the calculated range, then func_1(surface, end, y) is executed. In all other cases, there are no changes to the surface list.**
