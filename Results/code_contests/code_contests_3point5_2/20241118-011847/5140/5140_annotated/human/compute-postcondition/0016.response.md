Example Answer:
`end` is assigned the value of `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, otherwise it is assigned 8. The value of `y` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `end`. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is calculated based on the value of `y`, `end` is either `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or 8.
Output State: **`start` is calculated based on the value of `y`, `end` is either `y + 4` if `y + 4` is less than 8, or 8**
