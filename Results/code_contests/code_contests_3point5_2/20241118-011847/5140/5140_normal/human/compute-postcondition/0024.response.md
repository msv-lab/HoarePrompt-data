According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `i` is within the range of `start` and `end`. After the previous iteration, the values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` were adjusted to enable an additional loop iteration. This adjustment implies that the values at these coordinates were modified in such a way that the loop can continue. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- The values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` have been adjusted to enable the next iteration.
State: **The values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` have been modified to allow for another loop iteration**
