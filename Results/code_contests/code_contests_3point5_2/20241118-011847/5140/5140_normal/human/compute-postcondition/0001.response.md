Example Answer:
The variable `start` is assigned the value of `x - 3` if `x - 3` is greater than 0, otherwise it is assigned the value 0. The value of `start` depends on the initial value of `x`. The explosion at coordinates (X, Y) does not affect the value of `start`. Therefore, the Output State is: The bomb at coordinates (X, Y) explodes, changing the value at surface[Y][X] to 0; `start` is calculated based on the initial value of `x`.
Output State: **The bomb at coordinates (X, Y) explodes, changing the value at surface[Y][X] to 0; `start` is calculated based on the initial value of `x`**
