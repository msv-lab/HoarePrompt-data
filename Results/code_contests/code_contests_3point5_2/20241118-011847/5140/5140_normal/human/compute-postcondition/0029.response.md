The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. 

`surface` is a list of strings representing the plane, where each string is a sequence of 8 characters. Each character in the string represents a square on the plane, with '1' representing a square with a bomb and '0' representing a square without a bomb.

`x` and `y` are integers representing the X and Y coordinates of the first bomb to explode. 

The function does not have a specified return value. The functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the given surface and coordinates to determine the outcome of the explosion of bombs on the plane.
