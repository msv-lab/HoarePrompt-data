According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition based on `surface[i][x]`. If `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, the values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` have been modified to allow for another loop iteration if the condition is met. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the modification made to `surface[i][x]` must still be true.

State: **The values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` have been preserved for another loop iteration if `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true.**
