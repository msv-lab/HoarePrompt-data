Example Answer:
The bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes, changing the value at surface[y][i] to 0 if surface[y][i] is true, all other values in the surface array remain unchanged. Therefore, after the function execution, the output state is the modified surface array where surface[y][i] is 0 if it was true before, and all other values remain the same.
Output State: **Modified surface array after bomb explosion**
