According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. At the end of the last iteration, the bomb at coordinates (i, y) may have exploded and the value at surface[y][i] may have been changed to 0. Additionally, if surface[i][x] is true, func_1(surface, x, i) is executed. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. If the bomb exploded at coordinates (i, y) at the end of the previous iteration, the value at surface[y][i] should be set back to true to allow the bomb to potentially explode again.
2. If func_1(surface, x, i) was executed at the end of the previous iteration due to surface[i][x] being true, the effects of this function should be reversed if possible.

State: **Adjust the values at surface[y][i] and surface[i][x] as necessary to allow the loop to execute one more time.**
