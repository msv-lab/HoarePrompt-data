Example Answer:
The value of `end` is calculated based on the initial value of `x`. If `x` is less than 4, `end` will be `x + 4`, otherwise, `end` will be 8. The value of `x` is not given in the initial state, so the exact value of `end` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: The bomb at coordinates (X, Y) explodes, changing the value at surface[Y][X] to 0.
Output State: **The bomb at coordinates (X, Y) explodes, changing the value at surface[Y][X] to 0**
