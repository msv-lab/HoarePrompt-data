Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with arguments `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The function likely has a loop that iterates over the elements of the `surface` array. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` in such a way that the loop condition allows for an additional iteration. The specific adjustments needed will depend on the current values in the `surface` array and the loop conditions within the function. Since the exact details are not provided, the output state will depend on the adjustments made to `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` to enable one more iteration of the loop.
Output State: **Depends on the specific adjustments made to `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` to allow for an additional loop iteration**
