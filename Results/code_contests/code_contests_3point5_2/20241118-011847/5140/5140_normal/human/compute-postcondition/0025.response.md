Example Answer: 
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The function executes some code that modifies the values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` allowing for another loop iteration. The values of other variables are not specified, so the output state is: The values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` have been modified to allow for another loop iteration.
Output State: **The values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` have been modified to allow for another loop iteration**
