Postcondition: ***The values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` have been modified to allow for another loop iteration if `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true. Otherwise, there is no change to the values. The overall state of the program after the if else block execution ensures that the modifications made to `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` are preserved for another loop iteration if the condition is met.***
