Output State: 
The loop iterates over the range from start to end exclusively. If surface[y][i] is true for at least one i in that range, the bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes, changing the value at surface[y][i] to 0. All other values in the surface array remain unchanged. Additionally, if surface[i][x] is true, func_1(surface, x, i) is executed. If surface[i][x] is false for all i in the range, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to the surface array.
