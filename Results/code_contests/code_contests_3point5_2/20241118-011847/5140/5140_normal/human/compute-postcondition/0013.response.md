According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `start` and `end`. If `start` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes, changing the value at surface[y][i] to 0 if surface[y][i] is true. All other values in the surface array remain unchanged. After the bomb explosion, the surface array is modified accordingly, with the value at surface[y][i] being set to 0 if it was true.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `start` should be less than `end` and the state after the bomb explosion should be considered.

State: **The bomb at coordinates (end, y) explodes, changing the value at surface[y][end] to 0 if surface[y][end] is true. All other values in the surface array remain unchanged. `start` is less than `end`**
