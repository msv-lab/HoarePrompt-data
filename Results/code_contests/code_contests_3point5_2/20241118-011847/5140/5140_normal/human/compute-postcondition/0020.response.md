Postcondition: ***The bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes if surface[y][i] is true for at least one i in the range from start to end exclusively, changing the value at surface[y][i] to 0. All other values in the surface array remain unchanged. Additionally, if surface[i][x] is true, func_1(surface, x, i) is executed.***
