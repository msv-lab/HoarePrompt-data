According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `surface` array at coordinates (i, y) for each i in the range from start to end exclusively. If any of the values at surface[y][i] for i in the range are true, the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that at least one of the values at surface[y][i] for i in the range from start to end exclusively is true.
State: **The bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes, changing the value at surface[y][i] to 0 if surface[y][i] is true for at least one i in the range from start to end exclusively. All other values in the surface array remain unchanged.**
