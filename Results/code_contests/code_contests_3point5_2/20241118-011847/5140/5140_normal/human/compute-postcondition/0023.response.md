Postcondition: ***The values at `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` are adjusted to enable an additional loop iteration. The if statement conditionally calls `func_1` on `surface` at coordinates `x` and `i`. The adjustments made to `surface[y][i]` and `surface[i][x]` are crucial for the successful execution of the loop, ensuring the correct flow of the program.***
