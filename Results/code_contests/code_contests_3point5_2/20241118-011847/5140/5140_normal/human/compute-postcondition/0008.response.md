Example Answer:
If the bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes, the value at surface[y][i] will be changed to 0 if surface[y][i] is true. The function `func_1` will handle this explosion. The output state after running the function will depend on the initial values of the `surface` array at position [y][i]. If surface[y][i] is true, it will be changed to 0. Other values in the array remain unchanged.
Output State: **The value at surface[y][i] is changed to 0 if surface[y][i] is true. Other values in the array remain unchanged.**
