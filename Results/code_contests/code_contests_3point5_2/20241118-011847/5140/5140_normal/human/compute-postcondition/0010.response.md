According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. If `i` is less than `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes, changing the value at surface[y][i] to 0 if surface[y][i] is true. All other values in the surface array remain unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `end`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes, changing the value at surface[y][i] to 0 if surface[y][i] is true, all other values in the surface array remain unchanged**. `i` is less than `end`.
