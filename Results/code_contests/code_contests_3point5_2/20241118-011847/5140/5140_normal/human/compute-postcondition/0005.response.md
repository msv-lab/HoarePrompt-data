Example Answer:
The function `func_1` receives the surface matrix, and the coordinates (i, y). The function sets the value at surface[y][i] to 0, thus simulating the explosion of a bomb at coordinates (i, y). The affected value at surface[y][i] is changed to 0. The rest of the matrix remains unchanged.
Output State: **The bomb at coordinates (i, y) explodes, changing the value at surface[y][i] to 0.**
