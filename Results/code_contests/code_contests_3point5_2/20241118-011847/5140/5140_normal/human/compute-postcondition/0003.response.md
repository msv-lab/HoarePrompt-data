According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range between start and end is not empty. Since the bomb has exploded at coordinates (X, Y) changing the value at surface[Y][X] to 0, we need to adjust the state to reflect that X and Y coordinates are part of the range between start and end. Therefore, the adjusted state should be: 
State: **The bomb at coordinates (X, Y) explodes, changing the value at surface[Y][X] to 0, X is within the range of start and end, Y is within the range of start and end**
