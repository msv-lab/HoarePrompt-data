Postcondition: ***The bomb at coordinates (X, Y) explodes, changing the value at surface[Y][X] to 0 if surface[y][i] is true. The overall state of the program after the if-else block executes includes all possible cases where the bomb explodes at coordinates (i, y) with the value at surface[y][i] being set to 0.***
