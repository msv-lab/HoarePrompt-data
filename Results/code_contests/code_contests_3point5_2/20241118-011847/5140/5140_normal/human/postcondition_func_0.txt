The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. The function modifies the `surface` by setting the value at the coordinates (x, y) to 0 and then recursively triggers bomb explosions in the horizontal and vertical directions based on the neighboring bomb positions. The explosions propagate until no more bombs can explode. The function does not return anything.
