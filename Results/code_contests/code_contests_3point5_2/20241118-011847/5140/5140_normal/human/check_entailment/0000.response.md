Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the initial state of the plane, the position of the bomb that explodes first, and updates the state of the final plane after the explosion.
- The `func_1` function modifies the surface by setting the value at the coordinates (x, y) to 0 and then recursively triggers bomb explosions in the horizontal and vertical directions based on the neighboring bomb positions. The explosions propagate until no more bombs can explode.
- The code iterates through all the datasets provided and correctly outputs the final state of the plane after each explosion.
