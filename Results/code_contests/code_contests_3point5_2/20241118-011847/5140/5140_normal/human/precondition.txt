- Each dataset contains a blank line followed by the initial state of the plane represented by 8 strings of 8 characters each, where '1' represents a square with a bomb and '0' represents a square without a bomb.
- The coordinates X and Y of the first bomb to explode are given as integers between 1 and 8.
- The coordinates of the upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower right are (1, 1), (1, 8), (8, 1), and (8, 8) respectively.
