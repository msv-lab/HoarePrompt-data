Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the described operation of removing the leftmost occurrence of the substring "ST" in the string X. It maintains a stack to keep track of the characters encountered, and removes the "ST" pair whenever encountered. The program iterates through the string X and performs the operation as described. Since the logic aligns with the problem description and handles all occurrences of "ST" in X, the program is correct for all potential cases.
