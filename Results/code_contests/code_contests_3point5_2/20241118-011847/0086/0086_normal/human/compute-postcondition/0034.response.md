Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string input and processes it by creating a stack. It iterates through the characters of the input string and modifies the stack based on certain conditions. If the character is 'S' and the top of the stack is 'T', it adds 'S' to the stack. If the character is 'T' and the top of the stack is 'S', it removes the top element from the stack. The function prints the length of the stack at the end. The function does not accept any parameters and the output is not specified.**
