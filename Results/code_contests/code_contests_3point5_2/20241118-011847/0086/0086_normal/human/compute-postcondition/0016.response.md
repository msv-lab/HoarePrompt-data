Output State: **X is a string with an even number of characters, consisting of half 'S' and half 'T'. If the last element in the stack is 'S', it is removed. If the last element in the stack is 'T', the character at index i in s (if it is 'T') is appended to the stack, i is incremented by 1, and the stack only contains 'T' characters. The index i points to the next character in X, maintaining the conditions of the initial state.**
