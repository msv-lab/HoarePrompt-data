Output State: **X is a string with an even number of characters, consisting of half 'S' and half 'T'. The stack will only contain 'T' characters after the loop executes. If the last element in the stack is 'T', it is removed. If the last element in the stack is 'S', the stack remains unchanged. If the character at index i in s is 'T', it is appended to the stack. If the character at index i in s is 'S' and the last element in the stack is 'T', 'S' is appended to the stack. The loop will not execute if the input string s is empty. The length of the stack is printed.**
