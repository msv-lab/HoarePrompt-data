Example Answer:
The input is taken and assigned to variable `s`. Since the input is a string, the value of `s` will be the same as the input provided. As the initial state mentions that `X` is a string with an even number of characters consisting of half 'S' and half 'T', the value of `s` will also follow this pattern. 
Output State: **X is a string with an even number of characters, consisting of half 'S' and half 'T'; s is the input string**
