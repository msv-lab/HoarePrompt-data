Postcondition: ***X is a string with an even number of characters, consisting of half 'S' and half 'T'. If the last element in the stack is 'S', it is removed. Otherwise, if the last element in the stack is 'T', the character at index i in s (if it is 'T') is appended to the stack and i is incremented by 1. The stack contains only 'T' characters, and the index i points to the next character in X.***
