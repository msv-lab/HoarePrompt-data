Postcondition: ***X is a string with an even number of characters, consisting of half 'S' and half 'T'. If the last element in the stack was 'S' or the stack was empty, the character at index i in X is appended to the stack, i is incremented by 1, and the stack only contains 'T' characters. If the last element in the stack was 'T' and X[i] is 'S', then 'S' is appended to the stack, keeping the stack containing only 'T' characters. The index i points to the next character in X, maintaining the conditions of the initial state.***
