Postcondition: ***X is a string with an even number of characters, consisting of half 'S' and half 'T'. If the last element in the stack was 'S' or the stack was empty, the character at index i in X is appended to the stack, i is incremented by 1, and the stack only contains 'T' characters. If the last element in the stack was not 'S' and the stack was not empty, no character is appended to the stack and the program continues to the next iteration.***
