Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description. It reads a string input and processes it by creating a stack. It iterates through the characters of the input string and modifies the stack based on certain conditions. If the character is 'S' and the top of the stack is 'T', it adds 'S' to the stack. If the character is 'T' and the top of the stack is 'S', it removes the top element from the stack. The function then prints the length of the stack at the end. The code handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
