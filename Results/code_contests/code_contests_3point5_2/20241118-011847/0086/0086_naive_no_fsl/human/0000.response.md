Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly simulates the process described in the problem statement. It iterates through the string X and maintains a stack to keep track of the characters encountered. It removes the leftmost occurrence of 'ST' by popping elements from the stack when 'T' is encountered after 'S'. Finally, it prints the eventual length of the stack, which corresponds to the eventual length of X after all operations.

The program handles all potential cases where 'ST' pairs need to be removed, and it correctly computes the eventual length of X. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the given examples, the program is correct.
