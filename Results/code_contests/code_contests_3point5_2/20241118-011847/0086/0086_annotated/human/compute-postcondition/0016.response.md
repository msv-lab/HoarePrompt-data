Example Answer:
Since the code snippet provided is `continue`, it means that the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop or start the next iteration if the code is inside a loop. The variables X and s remain unchanged after running this code. Therefore, the Output State is: X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the next character at index i processed.
Output State: **X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the next character at index i processed**
