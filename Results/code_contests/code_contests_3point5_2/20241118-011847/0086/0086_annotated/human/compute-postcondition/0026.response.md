Output State: **Postcondition: X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the character at index i processed. The stack reflects the correct processing of 'S' and 'T' characters according to the conditions in the program fragment. i is incremented by 1 after popping the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty or the character at index i in s is 'S', then 'S' is appended to the stack and i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the program flow continues without any changes in the state.**
