Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length. If the character at index i in s is 'S', it is removed from stack. If the character at index i in s is not 'S', it is appended to stack. If len(stack) is 0 or the character at index i in s is 'S', then the character at index i in s is appended to stack. In all other cases, no change occurs. If the character at index i in s is 'T', then the character at index i in s is appended to stack.***
