Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a string `s` from input and iterates through its characters. If the character is 'S' or the stack is empty, the character is appended to the stack. If the character is 'T' and the top element of the stack is 'S', the top element is removed from the stack. If the character is 'T' and the top element of the stack is not 'S', the character is appended to the stack. At the end, it prints the length of the stack. The stack represents the leftover characters after processing the input string `s`, where if the stack is empty, `s` contains only 'S' characters, and if there are remaining elements in the stack, `s` contains an equal number of 'S' and 'T' characters.**
