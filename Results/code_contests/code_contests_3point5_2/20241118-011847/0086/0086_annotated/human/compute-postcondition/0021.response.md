Postcondition: *X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the next character at index i processed. If the character at index i in s is 'T' and the top element of the stack is 'S', then 'S' is removed from the stack. If the character at index i in s is 'T' and the top element of the stack is not 'S', then 'T' is appended to the stack. If the character at index i in s is 'S', no changes are made to the stack. The stack reflects the correct processing of 'S' and 'T' characters according to the conditions in the program fragment.*
