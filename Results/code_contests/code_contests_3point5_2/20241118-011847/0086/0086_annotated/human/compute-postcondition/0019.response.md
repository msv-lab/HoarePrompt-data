Example Answer:
The character at index i in s is appended to the stack. Since the stack is initially empty and the character at index i in s is unknown, the stack will contain only the character at index i after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the next character at index i processed, and the character at index i in s is appended to the stack.
Output State: **X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the next character at index i processed, and the character at index i in s is appended to the stack**
