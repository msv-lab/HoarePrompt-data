Postcondition: ***X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length, stack is a list containing the character at index i in s, i is 0. If len(stack) is 0 or the character at index i in s is 'S', then the character at index i in s is appended to stack. In all other cases, no change occurs. If the character at index i in s is 'T', then the character at index i in s is appended to stack.***
