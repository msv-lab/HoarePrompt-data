According to the postcondition, the loop can execute again if there are more characters to process in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the string `s` has the next character at index `i` processed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the index `i` needs to be incremented to process the next character in the string `s`.
State: **Postcondition: *X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the character at index i processed. The stack reflects the correct processing of 'S' and 'T' characters according to the conditions in the program fragment. i is incremented by 1.*
