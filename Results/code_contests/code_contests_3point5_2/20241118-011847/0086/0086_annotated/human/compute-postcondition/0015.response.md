Example Answer:
The character at index `i` in string `s` is pushed onto the stack. The length of the string remains even after appending a character. Therefore, the Output State is: X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the next character at index i processed.
Output State: **X is a string of even length containing only 'S' and 'T', s is a string of even length with the next character at index i processed**
