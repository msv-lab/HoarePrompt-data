Example Answer:
`needed_coins` is increased by 2. The previous value of `needed_coins` is unknown, so the output state is: Postcondition: *neg, num_zeros, needed_coins have been updated based on the conditions described. The number of negative numbers is odd. The number of zeros is not greater than 0. needed_coins has been increased by 2.*
Output State: **Postcondition: *neg, num_zeros, needed_coins have been updated based on the conditions described. The number of negative numbers is odd. The number of zeros is not greater than 0. needed_coins has been increased by 2.**
