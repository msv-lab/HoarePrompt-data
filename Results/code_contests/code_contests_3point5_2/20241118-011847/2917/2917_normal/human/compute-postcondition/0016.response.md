Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `numbers` contains at least two integers, `neg` is either 0, 1, or 2 (increased by 1 if `num` is negative), `num_zeros` is either 0 or 1 (incremented by 1 if `num` is 0), `needed_coins` is updated by adding the absolute value of `num` minus 1. If `num` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1.***
