According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one number in the `numbers` list. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^5, we know the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state such that `numbers` contains at least one integer, and for the first iteration, `neg` needs to be 0, `num_zeros` needs to be 0, `needed_coins` needs to be 0, and `num` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `numbers` contains at least one integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list**
