Example Answer:
`needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`. Given that the number of zeros is greater than 0, `needed_coins` will increase by a positive value based on the number of zeros. The number of negative numbers is still odd. Therefore, the Output State is: the number of negative numbers is odd, the number of zeros is greater than 0, and `needed_coins` has been updated accordingly.
Output State: **the number of negative numbers is odd, the number of zeros is greater than 0, and `needed_coins` has been updated accordingly**
