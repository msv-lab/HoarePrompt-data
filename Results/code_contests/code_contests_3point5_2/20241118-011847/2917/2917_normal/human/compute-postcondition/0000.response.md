Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is restricted to be between 1 and 10^5 due to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5. The numbers list contains n integers where each integer is in the range -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5. The numbers list contains n integers where each integer is in the range -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9.**
