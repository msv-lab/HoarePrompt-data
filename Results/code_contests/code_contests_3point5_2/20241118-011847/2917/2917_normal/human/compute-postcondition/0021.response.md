Example Answer:
`neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is unknown, so after execution, `neg` increases by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `numbers` contains at least three integers, `neg` has been incremented by 1, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `numbers` contains at least three integers, `neg` has been incremented by 1, `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged**
