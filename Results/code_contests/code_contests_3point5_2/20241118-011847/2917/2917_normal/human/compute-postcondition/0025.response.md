Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^5, `numbers` contains at least three integers. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1. If `num` is negative, `neg` is increased by 1 and `num_zeros` remains unchanged. If `num` is negative, `needed_coins` is increased by the absolute value of `num` minus 1. If `num` is non-negative, `needed_coins` remains unchanged.***
