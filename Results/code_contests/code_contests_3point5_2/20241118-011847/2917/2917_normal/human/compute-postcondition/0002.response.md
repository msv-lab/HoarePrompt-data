Example Answer:
`neg` is assigned the value 0. There are no other affected variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, numbers contains n integers where each integer is in the range -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9; `neg` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, numbers contains n integers where each integer is in the range -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9; `neg` is 0**
