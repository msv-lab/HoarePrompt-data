Output State: 
- If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute and update the values of `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` based on the integers in `numbers`.
- If all integers in `numbers` are positive, `neg` will remain 0, `num_zeros` will be 0, and `needed_coins` will be the sum of absolute values of all numbers minus n.
- If there is at least one negative number in `numbers`, `neg` will be the count of negative numbers, `num_zeros` will be the count of zeros, and `needed_coins` will be the sum of absolute values of all negative numbers minus n plus the sum of all non-negative numbers minus n.
- If there are only zeros in `numbers`, `num_zeros` will be the count of zeros and `needed_coins` will be 0.
- If `n` is 0, the loop won't execute and `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` will remain 0.
