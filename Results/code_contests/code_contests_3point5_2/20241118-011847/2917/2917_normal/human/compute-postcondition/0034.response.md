Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1. If all integers in `numbers` are positive, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is the sum of absolute values of all numbers minus n. If there is at least one negative number in `numbers`, `neg` is the count of negative numbers, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros, and `needed_coins` is the sum of absolute values of all negative numbers minus n plus the sum of all non-negative numbers minus n. If there are only zeros in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros and `needed_coins` is 0. If `n` is 0, `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` are all 0.***
