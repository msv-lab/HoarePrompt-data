Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer. If there is at least one positive number in `numbers`, `neg` is the count of negative numbers, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros, and `needed_coins` is the sum of absolute values of all negative numbers minus `n` plus the sum of all non-negative numbers minus `n`. If all numbers are positive, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is the sum of absolute values of all numbers minus `n`. If there are only zeros in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros and `needed_coins` is 0. If `n` is 0, `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0. After the execution of the if-else block, if the number of negative numbers is odd, `needed_coins` is increased by the count of zeros if it is greater than 0; otherwise, it is increased by 2. If the number of negative numbers is even, `needed_coins` is increased by the count of zeros.***
