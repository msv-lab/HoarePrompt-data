Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `numbers` contains at least one integer, `neg` is either 0 or 1 (increased by 1 if `num` is negative), `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is updated by adding the absolute value of `num` minus 1, `num` is the first integer in the list, and if `num` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1**.
