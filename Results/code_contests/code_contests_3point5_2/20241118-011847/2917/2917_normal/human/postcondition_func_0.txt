The function reads an integer `n` followed by a list of integers. It then calculates the number of negative numbers, zeros, and the total number of coins needed based on the absolute values of the negative numbers and subtracting 1. If the count of negative numbers is odd, it adds the count of zeros if present, or 2 otherwise to the needed coins. If the count of negative numbers is even, it adds the count of zeros to the needed coins. The final result is then printed as an integer.
