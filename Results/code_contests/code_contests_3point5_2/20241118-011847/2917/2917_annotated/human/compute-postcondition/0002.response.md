`neg` is assigned the value 0. This code does not affect the `numbers` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `neg` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `neg` is 0**
