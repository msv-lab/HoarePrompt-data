Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If the loop executes, `neg` represents the count of negative numbers in the list, `num_zeros` represents the count of zeros, and `needed_coins` is the sum of absolute values of all non-zero integers minus the number of non-zero integers. If the count of negative numbers is odd, `needed_coins` is increased by the count of zeros if it is greater than 0, and by 2 if it equals 0. If the count of negative numbers is even, `needed_coins` is increased by the count of zeros. If the loop doesn't execute, `neg` and `num_zeros` remain 0, and `needed_coins` is 0.**
