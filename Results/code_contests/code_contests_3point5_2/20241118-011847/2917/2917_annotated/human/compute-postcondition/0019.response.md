Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers. If `num` is negative, `neg` is increased by 1. In all cases, `num_zeros` is increased by 1, `neg` is increased by 1, or `needed_coins` is updated. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `needed_coins` is increased by the absolute value of `num` minus 1.***
