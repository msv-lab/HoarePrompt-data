Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If the loop executes, `neg` represents the count of negative numbers in the list, `num_zeros` represents the count of zeros, and `needed_coins` is the sum of absolute values of all non-zero integers minus the number of non-zero integers. If num_zeros > 0, `needed_coins` is increased by the count of zeros. If num_zeros = 0, `needed_coins` is increased by 2. The count of negative numbers is an odd number. The count of zeros in the list is either greater than 0 or equal to 0.***
