Example Answer: 
`num_zeros` is assigned the value 0. The value of `numbers` and `neg` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0**
