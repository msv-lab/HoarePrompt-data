Example Answer:
`num_zeros` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_zeros` is unknown, so after execution, `num_zeros` will be increased by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `neg` is increased by 1 if `num` is less than 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, `needed_coins` has appropriate adjustments based on the previous iteration.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `neg` is increased by 1 if `num` is less than 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, `needed_coins` has appropriate adjustments based on the previous iteration**
