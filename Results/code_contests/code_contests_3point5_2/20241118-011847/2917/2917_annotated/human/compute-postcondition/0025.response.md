Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers. If `num` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1. `num_zeros` is incremented by 1 if `num` is 0. `needed_coins` is adjusted based on the previous iteration, increased by the absolute value of `num` minus 1 if `num` is not 0. Overall, the program adjusts `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` appropriately based on the conditions of `num`, ensuring the integrity of the variables and their relationships after the execution of the if else block.***
