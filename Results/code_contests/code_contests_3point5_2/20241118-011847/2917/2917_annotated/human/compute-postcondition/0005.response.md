According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the numbers list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the numbers list is the key factor. So to adjust the state for the loop to execute, the numbers list must have at least 1 integer. Additionally, since `neg` is 0 and `num_zeros` is 0, they do not impact the loop execution directly in this case.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0**
