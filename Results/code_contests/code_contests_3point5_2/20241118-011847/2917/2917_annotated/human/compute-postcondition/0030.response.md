Example Answer:
`needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`. The value of `num_zeros` is already counted as part of `needed_coins`, so it is added again. The count of negative numbers `neg`, the count of zeros `num_zeros`, and the sum of absolute values of all non-zero integers minus the number of non-zero integers `needed_coins` are all affected. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If the loop executes, `neg` represents the count of negative numbers in the list, `num_zeros` represents the count of zeros, and `needed_coins` is the sum of absolute values of all non-zero integers minus the number of non-zero integers plus the count of zeros**
