Example Answer:
`needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`. The previous values of `needed_coins` and `num_zeros` are 0. Therefore, after execution, `needed_coins` becomes equal to `num_zeros`, which is also 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If the loop doesn't execute, `neg` and `num_zeros` are both 0. `needed_coins` is 0**
