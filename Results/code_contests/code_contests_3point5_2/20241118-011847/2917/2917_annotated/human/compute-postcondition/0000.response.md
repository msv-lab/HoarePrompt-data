Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `numbers` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. numbers is a list of n integers such that -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**; `n` is an input integer. 
Output State: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. numbers is a list of n integers such that -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**; `n` is an input integer.
