Example Answer:
The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `neg` is increased by 1, with appropriate adjustments made to `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` based on the previous iteration.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `neg` is increased by 1, with appropriate adjustments made to `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` based on the previous iteration**
