Example Answer:
`neg` is increased by 1. The previous value of `neg` is unknown, so after execution, `neg` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `neg` is increased by 1, `num_zeros` is increased by 1, or `neg` is increased by 1, or `needed_coins` is updated.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `neg` is increased by 1, `num_zeros` is increased by 1, or `neg` is increased by 1, or `needed_coins` is updated**
