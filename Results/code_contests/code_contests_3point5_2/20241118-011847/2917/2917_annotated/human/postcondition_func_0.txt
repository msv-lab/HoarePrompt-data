The function `func` reads input from the user for a list of integers and calculates the number of coins needed based on the absolute values of non-zero integers in the list. If the count of negative numbers in the list is odd, additional coins are added based on the number of zeros present. If the count of negative numbers is even, only the count of zeros contributes to the total coins needed. The final result is printed. The function does not accept any parameters.
