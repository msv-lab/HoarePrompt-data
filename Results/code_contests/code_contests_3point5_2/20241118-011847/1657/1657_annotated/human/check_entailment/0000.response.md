Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The function first checks if the desired topics for blogs connected by references are the same. If they are the same, it returns -1, which is in line with the problem description.
2. If the topics are not the same, the function returns a string containing numbers from 1 to n, which represents the order in which Johnny should write the blogs. This matches the requirement of outputting the order in which the blogs should be written based on the desired topics and references. 
3. The function covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that Johnny follows the strategy of choosing the smallest number topic not covered by neighbors.
