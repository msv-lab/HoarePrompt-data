The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. It iterates through the tuples in `arr`, checking if the elements at the corresponding indices in `topic` are equal. If they are equal, it returns -1. If the loop completes without finding equal elements, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.
