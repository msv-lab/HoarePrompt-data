The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. 

**Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5. arr is a list of m tuples where each tuple contains two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. topic is a list of n integers representing the desired topic number for each blog, where each topic number is between 1 and n.**

After executing the function body:
Case_1: If the element at index `a-1` is equal to the element at index `b-1`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change to the array or the indices `a`, `b`. If arr is an empty list, the loop does not execute.
Case_2: The program returns a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`, and based on the conditions mentioned above, it either returns -1 or a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.
