Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are integers representing valid indices in the topic array where the element at index `a-1` is not equal to the element at index `b-1`. If the element at index `a-1` is equal to the element at index `b-1`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
