According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `a` and `b`. If the element at index `a-1` in the topic array is equal to the element at index `b-1`, the loop will not execute again and the function returns -1. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are integers. So for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `a` and `b` need to be adjusted such that they represent valid indices in the topic array.
State: **`a`, `b` are integers representing valid indices in the topic array where the element at index `a-1` is not equal to the element at index `b-1`**
