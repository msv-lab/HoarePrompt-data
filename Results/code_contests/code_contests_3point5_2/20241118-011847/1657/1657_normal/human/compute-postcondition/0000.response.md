According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `arr` has at least 1 tuple. The loop iterates over each tuple in the list, so the loop will execute as long as there is at least one tuple in the list. Since n and m are given as integers, we do not need to adjust them.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5*10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 5*10^5. arr is a list of m tuples with at least 1 tuple, where each tuple contains two integers a and b such that a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n. topic is a list of n integers where each integer represents the desired topic number for the corresponding blog, and 1 ≤ t_i ≤ n.**
