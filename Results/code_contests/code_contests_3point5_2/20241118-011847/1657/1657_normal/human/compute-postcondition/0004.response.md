According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array `arr`. If there are still tuples left in the array, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `topic` is an array, `a` and `b` are integers. To execute the loop one more time, the array `arr` should have more tuples to iterate over. So no changes need to be made to the states for the loop to execute one more time.
State: *topic is an array, a and b are integers. If topic[a - 1] is equal to topic[b - 1], the function returns -1.*
