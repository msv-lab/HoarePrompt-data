Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. It iterates through a list of tuples in `arr` containing pairs of integers `a` and `b`. If the topics at positions `a` and `b` in the `topic` array are the same, the function returns -1. If the list `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the function returns a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces. **

Note: The actual code does not mention any edge cases or missing functionalities. It follows the annotations provided and accurately describes the behavior of the function.
