The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5*10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 5*10^5. `arr` is a list of m tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a` and `b` such that a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n. `topic` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the desired topic number for the corresponding blog, and 1 ≤ t_i ≤ n.

If `topic[a - 1]` is equal to `topic[b - 1]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the array `topic`, `a`, and `b`. The loop will not execute if the list `arr` is empty. In Case 2, the program returns a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n` and `m`, a list of tuples `arr`, and a list of integers `topic`. It checks if the topics at positions `a` and `b` are the same, returning -1 if they are. Otherwise, it returns the original array `topic` unchanged. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute. Additionally, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces in Case 2.
