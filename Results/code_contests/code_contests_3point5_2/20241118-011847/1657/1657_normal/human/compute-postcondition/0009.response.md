Postcondition: ***`topic` is an array, `a` and `b` are integers. If the element at index `a - 1` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` in the array `topic`, then the program returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Ensure that `a` and `b` are valid indices within the bounds of the array `topic`.***
