Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes input parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`.
2. It iterates through the list of tuples in `arr` containing pairs of integers `a` and `b`.
3. If the topics at positions `a` and `b` in the `topic` array are the same, the function returns -1, which aligns with the problem description.
4. If the list `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute.
5. Otherwise, the function returns a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces, which is the order in which Johnny should write the blogs based on the topics chosen.

The code logic aligns with the problem description for every potential case, and the output hints also confirm that the function is implemented correctly.
