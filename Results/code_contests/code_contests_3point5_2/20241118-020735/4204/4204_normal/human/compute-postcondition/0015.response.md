Output State: **`no` is a list containing at least two elements. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, the function `func_1` is recursively called with updated values of `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The loop continues iterating through `grafo[no[0]]` until all elements have been visited. Edge cases are handled where `no` does not contain at least two elements or the loop does not execute due to the condition `not visitados[vizinho[0]]` being false.**
