Output State: **`no` is a list containing at least two elements, the conditions in the loop allow for another iteration if there are more elements in `grafo[no[0]]` and `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False. `func_1` is recursively called with updated values of `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`.**
