According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `grafo[no[0]]`. If there is at least one element in `grafo[no[0]]`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `no` is a list containing at least two elements does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `no[1]` evaluates to true, `'value'` in dictionary `cand` is updated to the maximum between the current value and `no[0]`, `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True, and `vizinho` is the first element in `grafo[no[0]]`.

State: **`no` is a list containing at least two elements, `no[1]` evaluates to true, `'value'` in dictionary `cand` is updated to the maximum between the current value and `no[0]`, `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True, `vizinho` is the first element in `grafo[no[0]]**
