Postcondition: ***`no` is a list containing at least two elements. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, the function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. After the execution, `'value'` in dictionary `cand` is updated to the maximum between the current value and `no[0]`, `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True, and the state of the program variables are appropriately updated. Edge cases are handled where `no` does not contain at least two elements or `no[1]` does not evaluate to true.***
