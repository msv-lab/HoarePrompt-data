According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `grafo[no[0]]` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `no` is a list containing at least two elements. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, then the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- If there are more elements in the `grafo[no[0]]` list, the loop can continue.
- The `visitados[vizinho[0]]` condition being False allows the function `func_1` to be called again.

State: **`no` is a list containing at least two elements, the conditions in the loop allow for another iteration if there are more elements in `grafo[no[0]]` and `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False**
