Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The value of `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, and the depth is incremented by 1. Other program variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `no` is a list containing at least two elements, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, and other variables are appropriately updated.
Output State: **`no` is a list containing at least two elements, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, and other variables are appropriately updated**
