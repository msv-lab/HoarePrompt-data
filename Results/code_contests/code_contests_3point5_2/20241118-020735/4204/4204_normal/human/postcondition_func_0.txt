The function func_1 recursively traverses a graph provided as an adjacency list stored in `grafo`. It starts from a node specified by `no` and updates the maximum value found in the path in the dictionary `cand` if a certain condition is met. The function marks visited nodes in the `visitados` list. There is no explicit return value defined for this function. Edge cases include handling situations where the input `no` does not contain at least two elements or where the loop may not execute due to specific conditions.
