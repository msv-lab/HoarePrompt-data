Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description. The function func_1 is trying to find the maximum value in the path from a node to district 1, but it does not consider the fact that all problem roads on the way from the i-th district to the district 1 need to be repaired. The code also does not handle the case where the road type is 1, indicating that the road is not a problem road. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Additionally, the output hints do not align with the code as they do not mention the need to repair all problem roads on the way to district 1. The hints only mention the traversal of the graph and updating the maximum value found in the path, which is not the complete task required by the problem description.
