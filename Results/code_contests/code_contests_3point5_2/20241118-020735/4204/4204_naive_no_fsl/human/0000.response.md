Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input and builds a graph representing the city roads.
2. It then performs a depth-first search to find the maximum depth node for each neighbor of district 1.
3. It then selects the candidate representing that maximum depth node and adds it to the list of candidates.
4. Finally, it prints the minimum size of the required subset of candidates and the candidate numbers.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic as expected, and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work correctly.
