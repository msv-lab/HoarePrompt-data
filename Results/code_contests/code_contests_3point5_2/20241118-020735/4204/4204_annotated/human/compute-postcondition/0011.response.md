According to the code, the loop executes for each neighbor (vizinho) of the current node (no[0]) in the graph (grafo). If visitados[vizinho[0]] is False, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are positive integers or boolean values as described, and after the if statement, visitados[vizinho[0]] is False. So for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **n, xi, yi, ti, no[1], 'cand['value']', visitados[no[0]], grafo[no[0]], visitados[vizinho[0]] are positive integers and boolean values as described, visitados[vizinho[0]] is False**
