Output State: **After the loop executes, the function func_1 is recursively called on the neighbors of the districts connected by the roads specified in the input. The variables n, xi, yi, ti, no[1], 'cand['value']', visitados[no[0]], grafo[no[0]], visitados[vizinho[0]] are updated accordingly. If visitados[vizinho[0]] is False, func_1 is called with the appropriate parameters. If there are no neighbors to visit, the loop does not execute.**
