Example Answer:
The 'value' key in the 'cand' dictionary is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the first element in the 'no' list. The condition no[1] is true, and the values of 'n', 'xi', 'yi', 'ti' are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of districts in the city, xi and yi are positive integers representing the districts connected by the i-th bidirectional road, ti is a positive integer (1 or 2) representing whether the i-th road is a problem road or not. The condition no[1] is true. 'cand['value']' is updated to the maximum value between its current value and no[0].
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of districts in the city, xi and yi are positive integers representing the districts connected by the i-th bidirectional road, ti is a positive integer (1 or 2) representing whether the i-th road is a problem road or not. The condition no[1] is true. 'cand['value']' is updated to the maximum value between its current value and no[0]**
