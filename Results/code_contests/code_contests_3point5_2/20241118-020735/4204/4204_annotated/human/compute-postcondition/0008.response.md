According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the neighbors of the node `no[0]` in the graph `grafo`. If there are more neighbors to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:

- `n`, `xi`, `yi`, `ti` are positive integers
- no[1] is true
- 'cand['value']' is updated
- visitados[no[0]] is True
- grafo[no[0]] has neighbors

For the loop to execute one more time, the next neighbor `vizinho` to be processed must meet the following conditions:
- If visitados[vizinho[0]] is False, then func_1(vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand) is executed.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that the next neighbor `vizinho` in the `grafo[no[0]]` has visitados[vizinho[0]] as False.
State: **n, xi, yi, ti are positive integers. no[1] is true. 'cand['value']' is updated. visitados[no[0]] is True. grafo[no[0]] has neighbors. visitados[vizinho[0]] is False for the next vizinho in grafo[no[0]]**
