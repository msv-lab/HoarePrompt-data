According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the grafo[no[0]] representing the neighbors of the current district. Before the loop starts, to ensure the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n is a positive integer, xi and yi are positive integers, ti is a positive integer (1 or 2), no[1] is true, 'cand['value']' is updated, visitados[no[0]] is True, grafo[no[0]] has neighbors**
