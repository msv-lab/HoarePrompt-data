Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The main issue is with the function `func_1`, where it is trying to find the maximum value among the neighbors of a node, but it does not take into account the condition of whether the road is a problem road or not. This can lead to incorrect selection of candidates for repairing the problem roads.

Additionally, the program does not consider the condition where there are multiple possible subsets of candidates that can repair all problem roads. The current implementation does not guarantee the minimum number of candidates required to repair all problem roads.
