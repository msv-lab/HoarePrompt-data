Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program defines several functions to handle the construction of a closed curve based on the problem description. It correctly handles the logic of determining if a closed curve exists that satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem statement. The functions are designed to recursively construct the closed curve based on the input parameters provided.

The program iterates through all possible subsets of S and constructs the closed curve accordingly. It checks if the conditions are met for each subset and constructs the closed curve accordingly. If a closed curve satisfying the conditions exists, it correctly prints the curve in the specified format. If no closed curve satisfies the conditions, it correctly prints "Impossible".

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly constructs the closed curve when it is possible.
