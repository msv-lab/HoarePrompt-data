Postcondition: ***`s1` remains a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` remains a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `n` remains the integer value of s1, `ret_gp` might have been updated by adding the return value of `func_2(s)`, `i` is updated to be within the range from 2, `s` is a list containing values (v + 1) for v in range(n) where (i >> v) % 2 == 1, `ind` is within the range from 0 to n. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is met, then `ok` is set to False. All variables retain their initial conditions and constraints, ensuring the integrity of the program state after the execution of the if statement, covering all possible edge cases.***
