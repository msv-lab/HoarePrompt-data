Postcondition: ***`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. If `ok` evaluates to true, the loop prints out each pair of values in `ret_path` only if `ret_path` is not empty. If `ret_path` is empty, the loop does not execute. An error occurs after the third iteration due to undefined variables `x` and `y`. If `ok` is false, the program prints 'Impossible'. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the if-else block execution.***
