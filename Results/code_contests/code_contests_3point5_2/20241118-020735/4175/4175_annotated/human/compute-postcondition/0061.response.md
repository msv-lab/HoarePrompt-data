Example Answer:
The code prints the concatenation of the string representation of variables x and y. The values of x and y are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, `ret_gp`, and `ret_path` retain their initial values, `ok` evaluates to true, and the values of x and y are printed.
Output State: **`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, `ret_gp`, and `ret_path` retain their initial values, `ok` evaluates to true**
