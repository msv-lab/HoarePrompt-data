According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^(N+1) consisting of 0s and 1s. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `ind` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^(N+1) consisting of 0s and 1s. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2, `ind` is less than `n`**
