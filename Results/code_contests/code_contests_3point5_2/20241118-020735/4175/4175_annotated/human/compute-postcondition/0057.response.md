Example Answer: 
The program prints the length of `ret_path` minus 1. Since no information is provided about the initial value of `ret_path`, we cannot determine the exact value. Therefore, the output state is: `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. `ok` evaluates to true. The program prints 'Possible'.
Output State: **`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. `ok` evaluates to true. The program prints 'Possible'**
