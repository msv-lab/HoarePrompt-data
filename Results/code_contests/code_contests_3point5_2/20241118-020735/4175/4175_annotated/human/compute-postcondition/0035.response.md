Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement block:
- `s1` remains a string representing a positive integer N
- `s2` remains a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s
- `ok` remains either True or False based on the conditions met during the loop
- `n` remains the integer value of s1
- `ret_gp` might have been updated by adding the return value of `func_2(s)`
- `i` remains 1
- `s` is updated to contain elements (v + 1) for each v in the range from 0 to n-1 where (i >> v) % 2 == 1. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is satisfied during any iteration of the loop, `ok` will be set to False. The loop may not execute if n is 0 or s2[i + 2 ** ind] is out of range for any ind. If the loop does not execute, the output state will be the same as the initial state.***
