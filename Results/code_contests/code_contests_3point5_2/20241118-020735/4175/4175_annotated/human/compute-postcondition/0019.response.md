Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True, `n` is the integer value of s1, `ret_gp` is a list that may have been updated based on the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N where the condition (i >> v) % 2 == 1 is satisfied. If s2[i] == '0', `ok` may be set to False if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is met for any ind in the range of n. The list `ret_gp` is potentially appended with the result of `func_2(s)` based on the if condition.***
