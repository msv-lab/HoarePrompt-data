According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path` not being empty. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` is not empty. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. `ok` evaluates to true. `ret_path` is not empty**
