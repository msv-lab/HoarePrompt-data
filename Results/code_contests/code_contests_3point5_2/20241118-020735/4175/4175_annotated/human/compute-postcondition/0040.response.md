Output State: **`s1` remains a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` remains a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False, `n` remains the integer value of s1, `ret_gp` might have been updated by adding the return value of `func_2(s)`, `i` is updated to be within the range from 2, `s` is a list containing values (v + 1) for v in range(n) where (i >> v) % 2 == 1, `ind` is within the range from 0 to (n-1). Additionally, `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2`.**
