According to the code, the loop will execute if the range defined by `range(2 ** n - 1, -1, -1)` is valid. In this case, it means `2 ** n - 1` should be greater than or equal to -1. Additionally, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the specified range. 

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications are needed:
State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True, `n` is the integer value of s1, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `i` is `2 ** n - 1`, `i` is greater than or equal to -1**
