Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is True, `n` is the integer value of s1, `ret_gp` is a list that may have been updated based on the result of `func_2(s)`, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N where the condition (i >> v) % 2 == 1 is satisfied, and `s` is updated to contain elements (v + 1) for each v in the range from 0 to n-1 where (i >> v) % 2 == 1, `s2[i] == '0'`, and `ok` may be set to False if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i] + 2. Additionally, the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') holds true after entering the if statement.***
