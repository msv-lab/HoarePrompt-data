Output State: **After the loop executes, `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. `ok` evaluates to true. If `ret_path` is not empty, the loop prints out each pair of values in `ret_path`. If `ret_path` is empty, the loop does not execute. An error occurs after the third iteration due to undefined variables `x` and `y`.**
