Example Answer:
The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^(N+1) consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False.
Output State: **`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^(N+1) consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is False**
