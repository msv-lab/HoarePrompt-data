Example Answer:
The variable `ret_gp` is incremented by the value returned by `func_2(s)`. The function `func_2` is called with the parameter `s`. There are no other variables affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop checks if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2; `ret_gp` is incremented by the value returned by `func_2(s)`.
Output State: **The loop checks if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2; `ret_gp` is incremented by the value returned by `func_2(s)`**
