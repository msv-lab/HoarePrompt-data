According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ret_path`. If ret_path is not empty, the loop can execute. Since the program prints 'Possible', `ok` evaluates to true, so it does not affect the loop execution. 

For the loop to execute, `ret_path` must not be empty. 

State: **`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. `ok` evaluates to true. `ret_path` is not empty**
