Output State: 
- `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N
- `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s
- `ok` is either True or False
- `n` is the integer value of s1
- `ret_gp` is a list that may have been updated based on the result of `func_2(s)`
- `i` is 1
- `s` is a list containing values from 1 to N where the condition (i >> v) % 2 == 1 is satisfied, and `s` is updated to contain elements (v + 1) for each v in the range from 0 to n-1 where (i >> v) % 2 == 1

If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is met during any iteration of the loop, then `ok` will be set to False. The loop iterates over the range of `n` and checks this condition for each `ind`. 

The loop may not execute if `n` is 0 or `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is out of range for any `ind`. In such cases, the output state will remain the same as the initial state.

`ret_gp` is updated by adding the return value of `func_2(s)` to the existing list.
