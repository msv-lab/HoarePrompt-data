Example Answer:
The variable `ok` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the previous values of the variables `s1` and `s2`. Therefore, the Output State is: **s1 is a string representing a positive integer N, s2 is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, ok is True**.
Output State: **s1 is a string representing a positive integer N, s2 is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, ok is True**
