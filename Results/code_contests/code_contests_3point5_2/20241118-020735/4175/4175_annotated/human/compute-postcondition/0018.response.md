Example Answer:
`ret_gp` is assigned the value of `ret_gp + func_2(s)`, where `s` is passed as a parameter to the function `func_2`. The previous value of `ret_gp` is unknown, and the result of `func_2(s)` is also unknown. Therefore, the output state is `ret_gp` is updated based on the result of `func_2(s)`.
Output State: **`ret_gp` is updated based on the result of `func_2(s)`**
