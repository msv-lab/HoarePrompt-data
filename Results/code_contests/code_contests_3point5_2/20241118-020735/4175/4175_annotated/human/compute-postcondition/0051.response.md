Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, `ok` is either True or False based on the conditions met during the loop, `n` is the integer value of s1, `ret_gp` might have been updated by adding the return value of `func_2(s)`, `i` is updated to be within the range from 2, `s` is a list containing values (v + 1) for v in range(n) where (i >> v) % 2 == 1. If s2[i] == '0', the loop iterates over the range of n checking if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2**ind] == '1' holds, updating ok to False if it does. Finally, `ret_gp` is incremented by the value returned by `func_2(s)`.***
