Functionality: ** The function `func_6` takes two parameters `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is a string representing a positive integer N, and `s2` is a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s. The function iterates over a range of values based on N, performs certain computations, and updates variables `ok`, `ret_gp`, and `ret_path` accordingly. If `ok` is true, the function prints out pairs of values in `ret_path` under specific conditions. If `ok` is false, it prints 'Impossible'. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, there are potential cases where the code may lead to errors due to undefined variables `x` and `y` after the third iteration. **
