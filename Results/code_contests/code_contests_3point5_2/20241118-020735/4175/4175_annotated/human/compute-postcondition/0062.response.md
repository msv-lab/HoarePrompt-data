According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path`. If `ret_path` has at least one more pair of values, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, `ret_gp`, and `ret_path` retain their initial values, `ok` evaluates to true. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ret_path` needs to have at least one more pair of values.
State: **`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, `ret_gp`, and `ret_path` retain their initial values, `ok` evaluates to true, `ret_path` has at least one more pair of values**
