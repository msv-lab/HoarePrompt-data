According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `2 ** n - 1` to -1. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

- Since `i` is currently at -1, it needs to be adjusted to be within the range from `2 ** n - 1` to 0 for the next iteration.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **After the execution of the if statement block:
- `s1` remains a string representing a positive integer N
- `s2` remains a string representing a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s
- `ok` remains either True or False based on the conditions met during the loop
- `n` remains the integer value of s1
- `ret_gp` might have been updated by adding the return value of `func_2(s)`
- `i` is updated to be within the range from `2 ** n - 1` to 0
- `s` is updated to contain elements (v + 1) for each v in the range from 0 to n-1 where (i >> v) % 2 == 1. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2**n]`.
