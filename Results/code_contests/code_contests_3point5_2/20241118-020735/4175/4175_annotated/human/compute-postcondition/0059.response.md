Example Answer: 
The code prints the concatenation of the string representation of `x` and `y`. Since the values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. `ok` evaluates to true. `ret_path` is not empty.
Output State: **`s1`, `s2`, `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` retain their initial values. `ok` evaluates to true. `ret_path` is not empty**
