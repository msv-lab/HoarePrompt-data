Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program implements the given problem description accurately. It defines multiple functions to handle the logic of constructing a closed curve based on the input sequence of binary digits. The functions are structured to handle different aspects of the problem, such as generating points, constructing curves, and checking conditions for the closed curve to exist.

The program follows the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description, including handling different cases based on the input values of N and the binary sequence. The functions are designed to work together to generate the closed curve if it is possible based on the conditions.

Overall, the implementation covers all the necessary steps and conditions as outlined in the problem description, making the program correct for determining the existence of a closed curve satisfying the given conditions.
