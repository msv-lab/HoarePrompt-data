The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a sequence of length 2^N with binary digits (0 or 1) representing a sequence. The function processes the sequence recursively by splitting it into two parts, `pre_s` and `v`, where `pre_s` is the sequence excluding the last element and `v` is the last element. If the length of `pre_s` is 0, the function returns the last element of the original sequence `s` as a list. If `pre_s` is not empty, the function concatenates the results of recursive calls on `pre_s` and applies transformations with the last element `v`, forming the final result. The functionality also involves calling a non-existent function `func_1`, which is missing in the provided code.
