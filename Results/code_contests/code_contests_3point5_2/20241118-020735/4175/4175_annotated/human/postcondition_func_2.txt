The function func_3 accepts an integer parameter `v`. If `v` is greater than 0, the function returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number and either 0 or 1. The list starts with numbers from 1 to `v`, followed by tuples of (v, 1) and (v-1, 1), and finally numbers from v-1 to 1. If `v` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns the reverse of the result of calling itself with the negation of `v` as an argument. It should be noted there is a constraint that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, and A_i is a binary digit (0 or 1) for each i in the range 0 to 2^N-1, with A_0 = 1. However, the function lacks handling cases where v is 0, which could be considered as a missing edge case.
