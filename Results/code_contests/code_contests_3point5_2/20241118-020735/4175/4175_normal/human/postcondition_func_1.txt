The function `func_2` recursively processes a binary string `s` where each element is a binary digit (0 or 1). If the length of the processed string `pre_s` becomes 0, the function returns a list containing the last binary digit `v`. Otherwise, it constructs a list by concatenating `v` with the result of calling `func_1` on the processed `pre_s`, followed by the negation of `v` concatenated with the result of calling `func_2` on `pre_s`.
