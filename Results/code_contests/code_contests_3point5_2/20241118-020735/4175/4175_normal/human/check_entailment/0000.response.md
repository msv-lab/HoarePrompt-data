Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not always follow the problem description. The main issue lies in the function `func_2`. The recursive logic in `func_2` does not seem to accurately handle the conditions specified in the problem description. The function recursively processes a binary string `s`, but it does not seem to correctly construct a closed curve based on the conditions specified in the problem description. This discrepancy between the code and the problem description indicates that the program is incorrect.
