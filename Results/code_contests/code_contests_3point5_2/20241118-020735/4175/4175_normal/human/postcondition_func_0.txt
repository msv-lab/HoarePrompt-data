The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` and returns a new list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in the input list 'a'. The function assumes the input list 'a' contains binary values. However, it does not check if the length of the list is a power of 2 or if the first element is 1 as mentioned in the annotations. The function simply returns the negated values of the elements in the input list 'a'.
