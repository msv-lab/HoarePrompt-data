Functionality: The function func_3 accepts an integer parameter v. If v is greater than 0, it returns a list of tuples containing integers from 1 to v with corresponding values of 0, followed by a tuple with v and value 1, another tuple with v-1 and value 1, and then a list of tuples containing integers from v-1 down to 1 with corresponding values of 0. If v is less than or equal to 0, the function returns the reverse of the result of func_3 with the positive value of v. The actual code does follow the annotations provided.
