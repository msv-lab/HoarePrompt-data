According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `ind`, `i`, and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean, and the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2) is true. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
1. `ok` being a boolean does not affect the loop execution.
2. `ind` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `ind < n`.
3. No changes are needed for `i` or `n`.

State: **`ok` is a boolean, `ind` is one more than the previous value, `i` and `n` remain the same.**
