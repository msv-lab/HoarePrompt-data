According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the ret_path list. If there are more tuples in ret_path, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) based on the condition, `ret_path` has the initial tuple (0, 0) and additional tuples generated by applying func_4 to the results in `ret_gp`, `s1` is an integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, there should be at least one more tuple in `ret_path`.
State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) based on the condition, `ret_path` has at least one more tuple in addition to (0, 0), `s1` is an integer**
