Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with the parameter `s`. The value returned by `func_2(s)` is added to the variable `ret_gp`. The previous state of `ret_gp` is unknown, and the value of `func_2(s)` depends on the implementation of `func_2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ok` is a boolean variable.
Output State: **`ok` is a boolean variable**
