Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` is a list containing the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'. Additionally, for each index in the range of `n`, if the current bit of `i` at that index is 0 and the element in s2 at index `i + 2 ** ind` is '1', then `ok` is set to False.***
