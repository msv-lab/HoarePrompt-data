Output State: **`ok` is a boolean. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2**ind] == '1'` is true at any point during the loop, `ok` will be set to False. The loop will execute for each index in the range `n` checking the specified conditions. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `ok` remains True.**
