Example Answer:
The code snippet calls a function `func_2(s)` and adds the returned value to the variable `ret_gp`. The values of `ok`, `ind`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. If the function `func_2(s)` does not affect any of these variables, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`ok` is a boolean, `ind` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` and `n` remain unchanged, the loop may not execute, values of `ok`, `ind`, `i`, and `n` remain the same as the initial state.**
