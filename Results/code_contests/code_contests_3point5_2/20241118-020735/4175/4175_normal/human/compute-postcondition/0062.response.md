According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ret_path. If ret_path has at least one more tuple in addition to (0, 0), the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, ok is True, n is a non-negative integer, ret_gp contains the results of func_2(s) based on the condition, ret_path has at least one more tuple in addition to (0, 0), s1 is an integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the ret_path must have at least two tuples, and the loop will iterate over the next tuple in ret_path.
State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) based on the condition, `ret_path` has at least two tuples, `s1` is an integer**
