According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the index `i` is within the range of `2 ** n - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'. For the loop to execute one more time, the `i` index should be adjusted to the previous value. Additionally, since the loop body is not provided, we can't make assumptions about other states that need adjustment.
State: **`ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'.**
