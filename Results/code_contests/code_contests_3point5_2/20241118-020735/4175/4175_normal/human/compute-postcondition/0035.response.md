Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'. For each index in the range of `n`, if the current bit of `i` at that index is 0 and the element in s2 at index `i + 2`, `ok` is set to False. Additionally, `ret_gp` is incremented by the return value of `func_2(s)` for the given conditions.***
