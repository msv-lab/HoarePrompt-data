According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
1. `n` should be greater than or equal to 1.
2. `ret_gp` should contain the results of func_2(s) where s2[i] is equal to '0' for all elements in s2.
3. For each index in the range of `n`, the current bit of `i` at that index should be 0 and the element in s2 at index `i + 2`.

State: **`ok` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0' for all elements in s2, for each index in the range of `n`, the current bit of `i` at that index is 0 and the element in s2 at index `i + 2`.**
