According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, `ok` is True does not guarantee the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, adjust the state to `ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is the initial value of the range, which is `2 ** n - 1`.
State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `i` is `2 ** n - 1`**
