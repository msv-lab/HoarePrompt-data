According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and the range `n`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` must still hold true and `ind` must be within the range `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean, `ind` is a value within the range `n` where the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `ind` needs to be adjusted to the next value within the range `n` where the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` still holds true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ok` is a boolean, `ind` is the next value within the range `n` where the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true.**
