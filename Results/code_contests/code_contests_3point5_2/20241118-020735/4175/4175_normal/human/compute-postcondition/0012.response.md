Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean variable. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'` is met, then `ok` is set to False. The values of `i` and `ind` are adjusted to meet the loop execution condition, and `s2[i + 2]` must exist for the program fragment to execute. There are no changes to `i`, `ind`, or `s2` if the condition is not met.***
