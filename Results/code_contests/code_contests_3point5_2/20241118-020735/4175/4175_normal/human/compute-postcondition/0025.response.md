Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'` is satisfied, then `ok` is set to False. The other variables `n` and `ret_gp` remain unchanged. The postcondition ensures that if the specified conditions are met, `ok` is updated to False, while `n` and `ret_gp` retain their original values. The precondition constraints are maintained throughout the execution of the program.***
