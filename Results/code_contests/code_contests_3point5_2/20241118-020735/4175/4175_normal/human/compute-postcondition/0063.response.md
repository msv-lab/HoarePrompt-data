Example Answer: 
The code prints the values of `x` and `y` after converting them to strings and concatenating them with a space in between. The variables `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state, so this code will result in an error. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) based on the condition, `ret_path` has at least two tuples, `s1` is an integer**
