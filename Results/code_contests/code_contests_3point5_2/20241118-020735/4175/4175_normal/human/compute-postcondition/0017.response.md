Output State: **`ok` is a boolean variable. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'` is met for all iterations of the loop, then `ok` will be False. If the condition is not met for any iteration, `ok` will remain True. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and `ok` remains True.**
