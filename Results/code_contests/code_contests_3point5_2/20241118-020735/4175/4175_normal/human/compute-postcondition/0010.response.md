According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `i`, and `s2`. In this case, the condition is related to the bitwise right shift of `i` by `ind`, modulo 2 being 0 and `s2[i + 2]` existing. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean value, `i` and `ind` are not given, and `n` is the range parameter. We need to adjust the state in such a way that the condition for the loop to execute one more time is satisfied. 

To satisfy the condition for the loop to execute one more time, `ok` must remain true, and the condition related to the bitwise right shift of `i` by `ind`, modulo 2 being 0 and `s2[i + 2]` existing must hold. The values of `i` and `ind` need to be adjusted accordingly based on the end state of the previous iteration.

State: **`ok` is true, `i` and `ind` are adjusted values that satisfy the condition for the loop to execute, `s2[i + 2]` exists**
