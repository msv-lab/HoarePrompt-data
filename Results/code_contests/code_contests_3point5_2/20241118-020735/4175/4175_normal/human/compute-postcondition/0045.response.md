According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean, `ind` is one more than the previous value, `i` and `n` remain the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be less than `n`, so it should be adjusted to `ind` is less than `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ok` is a boolean, `ind` is less than `n+1, `i` and `n` remain the same**
