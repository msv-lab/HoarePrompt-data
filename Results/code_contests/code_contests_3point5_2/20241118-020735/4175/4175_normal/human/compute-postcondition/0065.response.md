Output State: **If n is a non-negative integer and s1 is an integer, the loop will iterate over ret_path, printing the x and y values in each tuple. If the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2] is met at any point, ok will be set to False. If n is negative or s1 is not an integer, the loop will not execute.**
