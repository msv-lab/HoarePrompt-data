Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with the argument `s`. The return value of `func_2` is added to `ret_gp`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ok` is a boolean. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2`, `ret_gp` is incremented by the return value of `func_2(s)`.
Output State: **`ok` is a boolean. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2`, `ret_gp` is incremented by the return value of `func_2(s)`**
