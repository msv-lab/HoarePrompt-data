Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'. If s2[i] is equal to '0', then for each `ind` in the range from 0 to `n`, if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1' is satisfied, `ok` is set to False. The values of `ok`, `ind`, `i`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. Afterwards, ret_gp is updated by adding the results of func_2(s).***
