Postcondition: ***`ok` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0' for all elements in s2, for each index in the range of `n`, the current bit of `i` at that index is 0 and the element in s2 at index `i + 2`. Additionally, the current bit of `i` at the `ind` index is 0 and the element in s2 at index `i + 2 ** ind` is '1'***
