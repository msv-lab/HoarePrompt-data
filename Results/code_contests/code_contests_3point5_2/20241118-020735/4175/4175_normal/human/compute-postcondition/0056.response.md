Output State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0', `ret_path` is a list containing tuples. The first tuple is (0, 0), and the subsequent tuples are generated by iterating over the results in `ret_gp` and applying func_4 to each result. `ok` is set to False if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2] is met. If `n` is negative or `s1` is not an integer, the loop does not execute. The code snippet prints 'Possible'.**
