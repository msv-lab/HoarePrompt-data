Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean. If the condition ((i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1') is met, then `ok` is set to False. `n` remains a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` holds the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0', and `ind` remains 0. It covers the case where the specified condition is true, resulting in `ok` being set to False.***
