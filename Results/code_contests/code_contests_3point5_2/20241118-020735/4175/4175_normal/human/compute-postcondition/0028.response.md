Postcondition: ***`ok` is a boolean and `ind` is a value within the range `n`. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'` holds true, then `ok` is set to False. In all other cases, the values of `ok` and `ind` remain unchanged, and the conditions `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2]` are still valid.***
