According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `n`, as well as the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean and `ind` is a value within the range `n`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` must be satisfied. This means that the value of `i` must be such that when right-shifted by the value of `ind`, the resulting value satisfies the condition. Additionally, `ind` needs to be within the range of `n`.

State: **`ok` is a boolean and `ind` is a value within the range `n` where the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true**
