Example Answer: 
`ok` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `ind`, `i`, and `n` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ok` is False, `ind` is one more than the previous value, `i` and `n` remain the same.
Output State: **`ok` is False, `ind` is one more than the previous value, `i` and `n` remain the same**
