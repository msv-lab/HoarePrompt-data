Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the values of `x` and `y` as strings concatenated with a space. The variables `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state, so the output state will remain the same.
Output State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) based on the condition, `ret_path` has at least one more tuple in addition to (0, 0), `s1` is an integer**
