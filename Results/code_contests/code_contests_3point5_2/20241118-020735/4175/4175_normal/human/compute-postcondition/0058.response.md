According to the code snippet, the loop can execute if `n` is a non-negative integer and `s1` is an integer. The loop will not execute if `n` is negative or `s1` is not an integer. 

Before the loop starts, `ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0', `ret_path` is a list containing tuples. The first tuple is (0, 0), and the subsequent tuples are generated by iterating over the results in `ret_gp` and applying func_4 to each result. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `ok` needs to remain True, `n` should be a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` should contain the results of func_2(s) based on the condition given, `ret_path` should have the initial tuple (0, 0) and additional tuples generated by applying func_4 to the results in `ret_gp`. 

State: **`ok` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) based on the condition, `ret_path` has the initial tuple (0, 0) and additional tuples generated by applying func_4 to the results in `ret_gp`, `s1` is an integer**
