According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ok` being a boolean does not affect the loop execution. The `ret_gp` containing the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0' indicates that func_2(s) is only called when s2[i] is equal to '0', so `ind` needs to be set to 0 since it's the starting index of the loop.
State: **`ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0', `ind` is 0**
