According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the range specified in the for loop. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'. If s2[i] is equal to '0', then for each `ind` in the range from 0 to `n`, if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the key is to consider the range specified in the for loop.

In this case, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is decremented by 1 and the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` is satisfied. Therefore, the adjustment needed is to decrement `i` by 1 in the state.
State: **`ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'. If s2[i] is equal to '0', then for each `ind` in the range from 0 to `n`, if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 1
