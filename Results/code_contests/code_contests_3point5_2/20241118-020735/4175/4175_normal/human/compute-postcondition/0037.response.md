Example Answer:
A list comprehension is used to generate a list `s` containing the values `(v + 1)` for each value `v` in the range from 0 to `n-1` where the condition `(i >> v) % 2 == 1` is met. The previous values of `ok`, `n`, and `ret_gp` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'.
Output State: **`ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'**
