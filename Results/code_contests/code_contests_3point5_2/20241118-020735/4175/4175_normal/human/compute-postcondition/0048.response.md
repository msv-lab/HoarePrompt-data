According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `n`. If `ind` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ok` is a boolean, `ind` is less than `n+1`, `i` and `n` remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ind` needs to be adjusted to `ind` is less than `n+2`.
State: **`ok` is a boolean, `ind` is less than `n+2`, `i` and `n` remain unchanged**
