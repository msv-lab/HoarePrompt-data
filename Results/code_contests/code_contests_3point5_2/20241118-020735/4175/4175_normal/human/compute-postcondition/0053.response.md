Output State: **`ok` is a boolean, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ret_gp` contains the results of func_2(s) if s2[i] is equal to '0'. If s2[i] is equal to '0', then for each `ind` in the range from 0 to `n`, if the condition (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2, `ok` is set to False. If `n` is negative or `s1` is not an integer, the loop does not execute.**
