The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `s1` and `s2`. Parameter `s1` must be a string representing a positive integer N, which is then converted to an integer `n`. Parameter `s2` is a string of length 2^N containing only '0's and '1's. The function iterates over a range based on `n` and manipulates the values based on bitwise operations. It then generates a list `ret_gp` based on the results of another function `func_2(s)` if certain conditions are met. Subsequently, it processes the values in `ret_gp` through another function `func_4` and constructs a `ret_path` list of tuples. If a certain condition is met during processing, a boolean `ok` is set to False. Finally, based on the value of `ok`, the function either prints a set of coordinates or 'Impossible'. The function does not have a specified return value.
