Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program implements the required logic to determine whether there exists a closed curve that satisfies the given condition for all 2^N sets S. The program follows the problem description by correctly constructing the closed curve if it is possible based on the input sequence A_0, A_1, ..., A_{2^N-1}. The program handles the cases where a closed curve is possible and prints it in the required format. Additionally, it correctly identifies when it is impossible to construct a closed curve. The program iterates through the possible sets S and constructs the closed curve accordingly. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the conditions specified in the problem description.
