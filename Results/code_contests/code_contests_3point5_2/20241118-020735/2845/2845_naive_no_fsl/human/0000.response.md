Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment. It simply calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array and adds 1, then divides by 2, which is not the expected value as per the problem description.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input
3
1 2 3

Output
2.000000

Expected Output
2.333333

Explanation: In this case, the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment should be (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.333333, but the program will output 2.000000.
