Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `arr` is not affected, so the output state is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers**
