Example Answer:
The variable `req` is assigned the length of the set of elements in the list `arr`. The list `arr` contains `n` positive integers obtained by converting the input values to integers. As `arr` is converted from input values and split by spaces, duplicates may have been removed in the set operation. Therefore, `req` will contain the number of unique integers present in the list `arr`. The output state is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers obtained by converting the input values to integers and splitting them by spaces; req is the number of unique integers in the list arr.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers obtained by converting the input values to integers and splitting them by spaces; req is the number of unique integers in the list arr.**
