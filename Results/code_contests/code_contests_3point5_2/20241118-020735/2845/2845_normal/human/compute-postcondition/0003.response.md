Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates (req + 1) / 2 and prints the result. The value of req represents the number of unique integers in the list arr. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers, req is the number of unique integers in arr, and the result of (req + 1) / 2 is calculated and printed.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers, req is the number of unique integers in arr, and the result of (req + 1) / 2 is calculated and printed**
