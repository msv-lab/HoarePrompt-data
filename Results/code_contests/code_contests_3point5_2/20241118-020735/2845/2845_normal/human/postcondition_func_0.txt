The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from the user input and a list `arr` of `n` positive integers. It then calculates the number of unique elements in the list `arr` and prints half of that number plus one. However, there is a missing functionality in the code as the division operation is supposed to be enclosed in parentheses for correct calculation.
