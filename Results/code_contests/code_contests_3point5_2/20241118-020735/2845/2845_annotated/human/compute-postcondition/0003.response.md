Example Answer:
The value of req is increased by 1, and then divided by 2. Since req represents the count of unique elements in arr, the output state is: n is a positive integer, arr is an array of n positive integers, req is the count of unique elements in arr, and the result of the calculation.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is an array of n positive integers, req is the count of unique elements in arr, and the result of the calculation**
