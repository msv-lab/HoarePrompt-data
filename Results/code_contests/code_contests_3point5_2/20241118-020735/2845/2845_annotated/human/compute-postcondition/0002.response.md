Example Answer:
`req` is assigned the length of the set of `arr`, which means it calculates the number of unique elements in the array. Since `arr` is an array of n positive integers, `req` will hold the count of unique elements in the array. The previous values of `n` and `arr` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is an array of n positive integers, req is the count of unique elements in arr.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is an array of n positive integers, req is the count of unique elements in arr**
