Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The array `arr` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is an array of n positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is an array of n positive integers**
