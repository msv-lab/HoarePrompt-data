Example Answer:
The variable arr is reassigned to the result of mapping each element from the input split by a space to an integer. The previous values of n and arr are unknown, but since n is a positive integer and arr is an array of n positive integers, after execution arr will contain n positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is an array of n positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is an array of n positive integers**
