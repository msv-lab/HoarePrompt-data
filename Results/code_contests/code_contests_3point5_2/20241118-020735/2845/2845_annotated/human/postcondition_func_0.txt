The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then reads `n` space-separated integers into an array `arr`. It calculates the number of unique elements in `arr` and prints half of that number incremented by 1. However, there is a missing functionality in the code where the division operation is incorrect as it should be inside a print statement to display the result. Additionally, the code does not return any value as specified in the annotations.
