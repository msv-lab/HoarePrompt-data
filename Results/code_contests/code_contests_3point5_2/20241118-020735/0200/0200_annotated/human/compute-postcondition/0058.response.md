Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `m` is updated with the frequency of `a[i]`, `cnt` is increased by the frequency of `a[i] - 1` in `m`, `diff` is updated based on the new value of `m`, `ans` is updated by subtracting `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from it.**
