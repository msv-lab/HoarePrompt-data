Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an updated integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i. If a[i] is already present in m, then the value corresponding to a[i] in m is increased by 1. If a[i] is not present in m, then m now contains the key a[i] with a value of 1. The rest of the variables remain updated based on the calculations.***
