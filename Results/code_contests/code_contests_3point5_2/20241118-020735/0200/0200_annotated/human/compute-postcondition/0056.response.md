Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. If `a[i] - 1` is in `m`, `cnt` is increased by the frequency of `a[i] - 1` in `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. Afterwards, `diff` is increased by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]` if `a[i] - 1` is in `m`. All other variables retain their initial values. The value of `ans` is updated by subtracting `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from it.**
