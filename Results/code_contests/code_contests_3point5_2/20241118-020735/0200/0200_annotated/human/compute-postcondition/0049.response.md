Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. If `a[i]` is in `m`, `cnt` is increased by the frequency of `a[i]` in `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding `a[i]` multiplied by its frequency in `m`. `sm`, `m`, and `ans` might have been updated based on the operations within the if statement.***
