Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an updated integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i-1, cnt is the sum of values of m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m, diff is the sum of the product of a[i] and m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m. The state of the program after the if statement executes varies depending on the values of 'a' and 'm'. If a[i] + 1 exists in 'm', cnt is incremented by m[a[i] + 1] and diff is updated by adding (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]. Covering all edge cases, the postcondition summarizes the potential changes to cnt and diff based on specific elements of 'a' and 'm'.***
