Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer input from the user using `raw_input()`. Since the precondition specifies that `n` is a positive integer, the value of `n` will be a positive integer. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= ai <= 10^9.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= ai <= 10^9**
