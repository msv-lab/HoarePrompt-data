Example Answer:
The variable `diff` is assigned the value of 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an updated integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index `i-1`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an updated integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index `i-1`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0**
