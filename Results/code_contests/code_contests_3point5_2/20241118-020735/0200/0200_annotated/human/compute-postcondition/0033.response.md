Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`, where `a[i]` is an element from the list `a`. The value of `a[i]` is unknown, so the exact increment cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an updated integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i-1, cnt is the sum of values of m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m, diff is the sum of the product of a[i] and m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an updated integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i-1, cnt is the sum of values of m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m, diff is the sum of the product of a[i] and m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m.**
