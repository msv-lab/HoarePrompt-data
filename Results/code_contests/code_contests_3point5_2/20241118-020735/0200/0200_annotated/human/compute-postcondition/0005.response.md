According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. The loop will start from `n - 1` and go down to 0. 

For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= ai <= 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1**
