Example Answer: 
The value of `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. This calculation depends on the values of `a[i]` and `m[a[i] + 1]`. Since the initial state of `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, and `m` contains elements up to index i-1, we need specific values to calculate the result accurately. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the specific values of `a` and `m`, which are not provided in the initial state.
Output State: **Output state depends on the specific values of `a` and `m`**
