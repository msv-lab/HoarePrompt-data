Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. If `a[i]` is already in `m`, the frequency of `a[i]` in `m` is increased by 1, `cnt` is increased by the frequency of `a[i] - 1` in `m`, `diff` is updated accordingly, and `ans` is updated by subtracting `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` from it. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, `m` is updated to include `a[i]` with a frequency of 1, `cnt` is increased by the frequency of `a[i] - 1` in `m`, `diff` is updated as described, and `ans` is updated as mentioned. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios after the execution of the if else block.***
