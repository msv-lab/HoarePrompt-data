Example Answer:
The value of `m[a[i]]` is added to `cnt`. The value of `m` contains elements of `a` up to index `i` with frequencies including the element at index `i`. Therefore, `cnt` will be updated based on the frequency of the element `a[i]` in `m`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is updated, `m` contains elements of `a` up to index `i` with frequencies including the element at index `i`, `cnt` is updated, `diff` is 0, `ans` is updated**
