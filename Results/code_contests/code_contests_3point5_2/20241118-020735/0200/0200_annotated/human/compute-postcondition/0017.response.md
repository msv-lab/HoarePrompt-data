Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i, ans is an integer, i is n - 1, cnt is an integer representing the sum of values from m corresponding to elements in a, and diff is an integer representing the sum of products between elements in a and their corresponding values in m. If a[i] - 1 exists in m, cnt is increased by the value in m corresponding to a[i] - 1, and diff is increased by (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.**
