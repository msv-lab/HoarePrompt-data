Example Answer:
`cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i]]`, where `m[a[i]]` accesses the value in the dictionary `m` at key `a[i]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, and `diff` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an updated integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index `i-1`, `cnt` is incremented by the value at key `a[i]` in dictionary `m`, `diff` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an updated integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index `i-1`, `cnt` is incremented by the value at key `a[i]` in dictionary `m`, `diff` is 0**
