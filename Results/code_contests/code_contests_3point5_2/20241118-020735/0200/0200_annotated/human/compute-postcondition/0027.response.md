According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of `n-1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an updated integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index `i` with the mentioned conditions.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be adjusted such that it is within the range of `n-1` to `0` for the next iteration. This means that `i` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an updated integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index `i-1`.**
