Example Answer:
The value of `diff` is increased by the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. The previous values of `a`, `m`, `ans`, `i`, `cnt`, and `sm` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i, ans is an integer, i is n - 1, cnt is an integer representing the sum of values from m corresponding to elements in a, and diff is an integer representing the sum of products between elements in a and their corresponding values in m, with an increase in the value of `diff`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i, ans is an integer, i is n - 1, cnt is an integer representing the sum of values from m corresponding to elements in a, and diff is an integer representing the sum of products between elements in a and their corresponding values in m with an increase in the value of `diff`.**
