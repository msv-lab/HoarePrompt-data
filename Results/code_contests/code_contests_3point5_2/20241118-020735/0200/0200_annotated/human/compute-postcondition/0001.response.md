Example Answer:
The list `a` is updated by converting the space-separated input values to integers using `map` and `int`. The list `a` now contains n integers. The values in the list `a` are between 1 and 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= ai <= 10^9.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= ai <= 10^9**
