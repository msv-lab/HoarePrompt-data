Example Answer:
The value of `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an updated integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index `i-1`, `cnt` is incremented by the value at key `a[i]` in dictionary `m`, `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an updated integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index `i-1`, `cnt` is incremented by the value at key `a[i]` in dictionary `m`, `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`**
