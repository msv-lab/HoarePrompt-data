Example Answer: 
The variable `sm` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are involved, the output state is simply: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= ai <= 10^9, `sm` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= ai <= 10^9, `sm` is 0**
