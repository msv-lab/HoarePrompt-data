Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an updated integer with the addition of a[i], m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i-1, cnt is the sum of values of m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m, diff is the sum of the product of a[i] and m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m. After the if statement executes, if a[i] - 1 exists in 'm', cnt is incremented by m[a[i] - 1] and diff is updated by adding a[i] * m[a[i]], diff is further updated by adding (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1. ans is updated by adding sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)**
