Example Answer:
The value of `sm` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. The previous values of `sm` and `a[i]` are known, so after execution, the new value of `sm` will be the sum of the previous `sm` and `a[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an updated integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i, ans is an integer (updated based on the calculation), i is n - 1, cnt is an integer representing the sum of values from m corresponding to elements in a, and diff is an integer representing the sum of products between elements in a and their corresponding values in m.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an updated integer, m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i, ans is an integer (updated based on the calculation), i is n - 1, cnt is an integer representing the sum of values from m corresponding to elements in a, and diff is an integer representing the sum of products between elements in a and their corresponding values in m**
