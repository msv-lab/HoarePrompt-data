Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, sm is an updated integer with the addition of a[i], m is a dictionary containing elements of a up to index i with a[i] mapped to the frequency of occurrence of a[i], cnt is the sum of values of m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m, diff is the sum of the product of a[i] and m[a[i]] for each a[i] that appears in m, ans is updated by adding sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt) based on the operations performed in the if else block. If a[i] already exists in 'm', its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, a[i] is added to 'm' with a count of 1. The values of cnt, diff, and ans are updated accordingly.***
