According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to -1.
State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is greater than or equal to -1**
