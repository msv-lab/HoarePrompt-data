Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9, `sm` is an integer, `m` is a dictionary containing elements of `a` up to index i, `ans` is an integer, `i` is n - 1, `cnt` is an integer representing the sum of values from `m` corresponding to elements in `a`, and `diff` is an integer representing the sum of products between elements in `a` and their corresponding values in `m`. Additionally, the value of `a[i] + 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, and `cnt` is increased by the value in `m` corresponding to `a[i] + 1`, and `diff` is increased by `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`.**
