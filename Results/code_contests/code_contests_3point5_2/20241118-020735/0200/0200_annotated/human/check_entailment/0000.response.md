Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) as described in the problem statement.
- The program uses a dictionary `m` to keep track of the frequency of each element encountered in the array `a`, allowing it to efficiently calculate the desired sum.
- The loop iterates over the array in reverse order, ensuring that all pairs (i, j) where i â‰¤ j are considered.
- The program handles cases where the current element `a[i]` is in `m`, `a[i] + 1` is in `m`, and `a[i] - 1` is in `m` to correctly calculate the sum based on the formula provided in the problem description.
- The final output `ans` is correctly calculated and printed.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the problem description, the code is correct for all potential cases.
