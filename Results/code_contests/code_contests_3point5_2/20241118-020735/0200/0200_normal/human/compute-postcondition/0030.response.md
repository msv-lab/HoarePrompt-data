Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `sm` is updated by adding the value of `a[i-1]`, `m` is a dictionary containing the elements of `a` up to index `i-1` with the key `a[i-1]` and its value updated accordingly, `ans` is updated by subtracting `diff` and `a[i-1] * (n - i - cnt)`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is decremented by 1, `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i-1]` from dictionary `m`, `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i-1]` and the value of key `a[i-1]` from dictionary `m`, `cnt` is initialized to 0, `diff` is 0, `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i-1]` from dictionary `m`**
