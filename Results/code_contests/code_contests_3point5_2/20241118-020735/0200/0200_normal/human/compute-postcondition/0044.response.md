According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `m` has been updated based on the conditions mentioned, `cnt` and `diff` may have been updated, `ans` may have been updated, and `sm` has been increased by `a[i]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be greater than or equal to 1 to satisfy the range condition `range(n-1, -1, -1)`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `m` has been updated based on conditions, `cnt` and `diff` may have been updated, `ans` may have been updated, `sm` has been increased by `a[i]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
