Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. If `a[i]` is present in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]` and `diff` is updated by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. `ans` may have been updated, `sm` has been increased by `a[i]`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, there are no changes to the variables.***
