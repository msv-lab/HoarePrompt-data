Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated such that `m[a[i]]` is assigned the value 1. The list `a` remains unchanged, `m` now contains an entry for `a[i]` with the value 1. The variables `cnt`, `diff`, `ans` are not affected by this operation. The value of `sm` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `m` contains an entry for `a[i]` with the value 1, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, `ans` is updated, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`.
Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `m` contains an entry for `a[i]` with the value 1, `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on conditions, `ans` is updated, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`**
