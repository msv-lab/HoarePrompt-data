Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. The loop calculates the values of `cnt`, `diff`, and `ans` based on the conditions provided. `sm` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` in each iteration. The dictionary `m` contains the elements of `a` up to index `i` with the key being the element and the value being the frequency. If `a[i]` is already in `m`, its frequency is incremented by 1, otherwise a new entry is added. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.**
