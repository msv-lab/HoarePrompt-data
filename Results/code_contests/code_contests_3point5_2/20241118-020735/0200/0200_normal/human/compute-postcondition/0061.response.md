According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, if `a[i]` is already a key in dictionary `m`, then the corresponding value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, a new key `a[i]` is added to `m` with the value 1. In either case, `cnt`, `diff`, `ans` have been updated, `sm` has been increased by the value of `a[i]`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0**
