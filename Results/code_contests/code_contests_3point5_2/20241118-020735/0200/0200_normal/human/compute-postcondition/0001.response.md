Example Answer:
The list `a` is created by mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split by whitespace. The initial values of `a` are not provided, as they depend on the user input. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of integers based on user input.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers based on user input**
