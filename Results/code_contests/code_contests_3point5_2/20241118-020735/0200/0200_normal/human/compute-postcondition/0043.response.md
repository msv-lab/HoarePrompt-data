Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. If `a[i]` is already present in `m`, then the value corresponding to `a[i]` in `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, a new entry is added to `m` with `a[i]` as the key and 1 as the value. `cnt` and `diff` may have been updated based on conditions. `ans` may have been updated. `sm` is increased by `a[i]` in all cases.***
