Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the elements of `a` up to index `i`, `ans` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the last index of list `a`, `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i]` from dictionary `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and the value of key `a[i]` from dictionary `m`. The postcondition handles the case where the element `a[i]` is already in the dictionary `m`, updating `cnt` and `diff` accordingly. Additionally, it ensures that the values of `a`, `sm`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, and `diff` remain unchanged.***
