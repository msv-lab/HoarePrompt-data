Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, if `a[i]` is present in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is updated by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` may have been updated, `sm` has been increased by `a[i]`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, there are no changes to the variables. After executing the code, `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`.**
