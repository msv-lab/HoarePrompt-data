Example Answer:
The value of `diff` is increased by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. The previous values of `a[i]`, `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` are required to calculate the result. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `m` has been updated based on conditions, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is updated by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` may have been updated, `sm` has been increased by `a[i]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `m` has been updated based on conditions, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is updated by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` may have been updated, `sm` has been increased by `a[i]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
