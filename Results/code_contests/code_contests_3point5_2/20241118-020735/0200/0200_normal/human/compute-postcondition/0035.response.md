Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. If `a[i] + 1` is found in dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i] + 1` from dictionary `m` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i] + 1` and the value of key `a[i] + 1` from dictionary `m`. All other variables maintain their relationships and values as described in the precondition. Ensure that the postcondition covers all possible cases, including scenarios where `a[i] + 1` is not found in dictionary `m`, and summarize the state of the program after the if-else block executes.***
