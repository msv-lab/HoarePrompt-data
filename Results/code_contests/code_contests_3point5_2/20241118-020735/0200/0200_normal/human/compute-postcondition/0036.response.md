Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. If `a[i] + 1` is found in dictionary `m`, `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i] - 1` from dictionary `m`. `diff` remains unchanged. All other variables maintain their relationships and values as described in the precondition.**
