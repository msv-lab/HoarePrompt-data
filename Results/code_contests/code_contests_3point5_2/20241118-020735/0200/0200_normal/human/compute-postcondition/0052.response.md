Postcondition: *`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. If `a[i]` is present in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is updated by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` may have been updated, `sm` has been increased by `a[i]`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, there are no changes to the variables. After executing the code, if `a[i] + 1` is present in `m`, `cnt` is further increased by `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. This covers all cases including the scenarios where `a[i]` or `a[i] + 1` is not in `m`, ensuring the correct modifications in the variables based on the conditions.*
