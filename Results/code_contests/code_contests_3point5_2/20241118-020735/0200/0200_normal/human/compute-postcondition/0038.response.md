Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. If `a[i] - 1` is found in dictionary `m`, `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i] - 1` from dictionary `m` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and the value of key `a[i] - 1` from dictionary `m`. All other variables maintain their relationships and values as described in the precondition. If `a[i] - 1` is not found in dictionary `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
