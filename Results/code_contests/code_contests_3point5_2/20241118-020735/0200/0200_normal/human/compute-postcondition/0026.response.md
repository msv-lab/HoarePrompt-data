Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `sm` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]`, `m` is a dictionary containing the elements of `a` up to index `i` with the key `a[i]` and its value updated accordingly, `ans` is updated by subtracting `diff` and `a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the last index of list `a`, `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i]` from dictionary `m`, `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and the value of key `a[i]` from dictionary `m`. If `a[i]` is already in the dictionary `m`, its value is incremented by 1, else a new entry is created with the key `a[i]` and value as 1.***
