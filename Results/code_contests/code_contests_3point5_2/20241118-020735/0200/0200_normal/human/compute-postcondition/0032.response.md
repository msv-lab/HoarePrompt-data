Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. The variables `sm`, `m`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `cnt`, and `diff` are all updated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment. If `a[i]` is found in dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i]` from dictionary `m` and `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and the value of key `a[i]` from dictionary `m`. All other variables maintain their relationships and values as described in the precondition. Ensure that the postcondition covers all possible edge cases and updates to the variables.***
