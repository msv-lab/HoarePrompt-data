Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input. If `a[i]` is already a key in dictionary `m`, then the corresponding value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, a new key `a[i]` is added to `m` with the value 1. In either case, `cnt`, `diff`, `ans` have been updated, `sm` has been increased by the value of `a[i]`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1.***
