Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0**
