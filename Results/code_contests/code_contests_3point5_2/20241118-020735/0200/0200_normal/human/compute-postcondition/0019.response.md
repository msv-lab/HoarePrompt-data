Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers based on user input, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the elements of `a` up to index `i`, `ans` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the last index of list `a`, `cnt` is updated by adding the value of key `a[i]` from dictionary `m`, `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and the value of key `a[i]` from dictionary `m`. If `a[i] + 1` is in `m`, `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]` and `diff` is increased by the product of `a[i] + 1` and `m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` is in `m`, `cnt` is further increased by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. The values of `a`, `sm`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `cnt`, and `diff` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
