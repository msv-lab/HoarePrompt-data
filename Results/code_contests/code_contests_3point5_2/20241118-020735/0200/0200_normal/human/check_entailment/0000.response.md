Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, as described in the problem. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the array and calculates the sum based on the current element and its neighbors. The code iterates through the array in reverse order to handle the calculations correctly. The output hints also agree with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases.
