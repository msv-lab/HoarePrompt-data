Functionality: The function reads an integer n from the user input, followed by a list of integers a. It then iterates over the list a, calculating the sum of certain values based on the current element and its neighbors in the list. The function prints the final calculated sum ans. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and it performs calculations solely based on the user input. If the user provides an input where n is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated.
