Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, as described in the problem statement. The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element and calculates the sum accordingly. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem. Additionally, the program handles the given input format and constraints properly.
