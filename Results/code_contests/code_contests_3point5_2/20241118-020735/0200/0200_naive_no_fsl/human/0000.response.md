Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program calculates the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n. The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element seen so far. It iterates through the array in reverse order and calculates the sum based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

The program considers all possible cases where ai, ai+1, ai-1 are present in the dictionary to calculate the sum. It correctly computes the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) for the given input examples.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, so the correctness is True.
