Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `k` and a list `candy_array`. It iterates through the candies in `candy_array`, updating a dictionary `res_map` based on certain conditions. If a specific key-value pair exists in `res_map`, it increments the result `res` by 2 and updates the corresponding value in `res_map`. If the key does not exist, a new key is added. The function prints the final value of `res` but does not return any specific output. The function lacks proper error handling for cases where `k` is not within the specified range or if `candy_array` is not a list of integers as described in the annotations.**
