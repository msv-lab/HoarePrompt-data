Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs representing counts of certain values. If `candy_array` is not empty, the loop will iterate through each candy. If a key `k - candy % k` exists in `res_map` with a value greater than 0, `res` is incremented by 2 and the corresponding value in `res_map` is decremented by 1. If the key does not exist or the value is 0, a new key `candy % k` is added to `res_map` with a value of 1. This process is repeated for all candies in `candy_array`. In cases where `candy_array` is empty or the conditions inside the loop are not met, `res_map` remains unchanged and `res` remains 0.**
