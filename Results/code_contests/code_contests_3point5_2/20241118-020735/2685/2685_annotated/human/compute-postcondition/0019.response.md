According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `candy_array`. At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, and `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted in the following way:
1. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, then `res` is incremented by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decreased by 1.
2. If the above condition is not met, then the value at key `candy % k` needs to be either increased by 1 or set to 1 if the key does not exist.

State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least two more candies than before, and the conditions for adjusting `res_map` and `res` as described above have been met.**
