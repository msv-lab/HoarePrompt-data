According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If there are more candies in the array, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `res_map` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the count of certain values based on the conditions mentioned in the code. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that there is at least one more candy in the `candy_array` and the `res_map` is updated according to the conditions mentioned in the code fragment.

State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs based on the conditions mentioned in the code, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before.**
