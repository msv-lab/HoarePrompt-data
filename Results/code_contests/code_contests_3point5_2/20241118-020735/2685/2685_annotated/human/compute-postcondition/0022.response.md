The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` and `candy_array`. `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100, and `candy_array` is a list of integers where each element d_i satisfies 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. The function does not return any specific output as the expected behavior or functionality is not provided.
