Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, then `res` is incremented by 2 and the value at key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, the value at key `candy % k` is either increased by 1 or set to 1 if the key does not exist. This handles all possible cases and edge scenarios involving `res_map`, `candy_array`, and `res` after the execution of the if-else block.***
