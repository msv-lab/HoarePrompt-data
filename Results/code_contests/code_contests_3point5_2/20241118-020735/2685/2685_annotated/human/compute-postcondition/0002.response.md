According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the candy_array. If the candy_array has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since the res_map is an empty dictionary and res is 0, no adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute.
State: **`res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0**
