Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the count of certain values. If there is a key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` with a value greater than 0, then `res` is incremented by 2 and the value corresponding to the key `k - candy % k` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if there is no such key in `res_map`, a new key `candy % k` is added with a value of 1. In both cases, the dictionary `res_map` is updated accordingly based on the conditions mentioned in the code fragment.***
