Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The previous values of other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before, `res` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before, `res` is incremented by 2**
