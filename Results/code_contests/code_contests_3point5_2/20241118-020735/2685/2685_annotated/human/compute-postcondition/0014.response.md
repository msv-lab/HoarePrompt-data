According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more candy in the `candy_array` than before. At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, and `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. The `candy_array` should have at least one more candy than before.
2. The values in `res_map` should be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned in the code.

State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before**
