Example Answer: 
The value of the key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decremented by 1. The dictionary `res_map` is updated with the new key-value pair. The `candy_array` now has at least one more candy than before. The variable `res` is incremented by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before, `res` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before, `res` is incremented by 2**
