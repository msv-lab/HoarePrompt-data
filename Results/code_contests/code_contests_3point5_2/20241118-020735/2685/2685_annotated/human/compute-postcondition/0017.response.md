Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `res_map` by incrementing the count of the key `candy % k` by 1 if the key already exists, or initializes it to 1 if the key is not present in the dictionary. The `candy % k` is the key derived from the modulo operation, and the value is incremented by 1. The `candy_array` is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before**
