Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs based on the conditions mentioned in the code, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and the corresponding value is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 2 and the value associated with key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, a new key-value pair is added to `res_map` with the key `candy % k` and the value is incremented by 1 if `res_map` already has the key `candy % k`, otherwise the value is set to 1.***
