Example Answer:
The value of `res` is increased by 2. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so after execution, `res` will have 2 more than its previous value. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs based on the conditions mentioned in the code, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before, `res` has 2 more than its previous value.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary with updated key-value pairs based on the conditions mentioned in the code, `candy_array` has at least one more candy than before, `res` has 2 more than its previous value**
