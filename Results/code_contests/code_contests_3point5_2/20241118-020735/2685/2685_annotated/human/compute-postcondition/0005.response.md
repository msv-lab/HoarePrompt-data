Example Answer:
The value of `k` is used to calculate the key for `res_map`, which is `k - candy % k`. The value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. The conditions state that there is a key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` and the corresponding value is greater than 0. Since we do not have the value of `candy`, we cannot determine the exact outcome of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 2, `k` is the key in `res_map`, and there is a key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` with a value greater than 0.
Output State: **`res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 2, `k` is the key in `res_map`, and there is a key `k - candy % k` in `res_map` with a value greater than 0**
