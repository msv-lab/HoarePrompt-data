Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary, `res`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and the initial conditions of `res_map` remain unchanged. `res` is increased by 2.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and the initial conditions of `res_map` remain unchanged. `res` is increased by 2**
