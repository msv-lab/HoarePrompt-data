Example Answer: 
The code snippet updates the `res_map` dictionary by incrementing the value corresponding to the key `candy % k` by 1 if the key exists, otherwise setting the value to 1. The initial state of `res_map` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and the initial conditions of `res_map` remain unchanged**
