According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the candy_array. At the end of the last iteration, the postcondition states that `res`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and the initial conditions of `res_map` remain unchanged. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the candy_array must still have elements left to iterate over.
State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and the initial conditions of `res_map` remain unchanged.**
