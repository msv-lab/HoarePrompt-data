Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary. If the key `k - candy % k` exists in `res_map` and its corresponding value is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 2 and that specific value in `res_map` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is added to `res_map` where the key is `candy % k` and the value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists, or set to 1 if the key didn't exist before. The variables `res`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and the initial conditions of `res_map` remain unchanged. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios.***
