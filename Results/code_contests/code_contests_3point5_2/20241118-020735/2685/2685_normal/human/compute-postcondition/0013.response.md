Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary, `res`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and the initial conditions of `res_map` remain unchanged. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and the value corresponding to that key is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, `res_map[candy % k]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `candy % k` is a key in `res_map`. This accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases involving the values of `res`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and `res_map` after the execution of the if else block.***
