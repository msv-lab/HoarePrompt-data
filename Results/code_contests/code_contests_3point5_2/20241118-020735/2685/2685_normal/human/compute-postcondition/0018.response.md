Postcondition: ***`res_map` is a dictionary that has been updated based on the conditions inside the if-else block. If `res_map` has the key (k - candy % k) and the value corresponding to that key is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value in `res_map` for that key is decremented by 1. In the else part, if the condition is not met, `res_map` is updated with the key as candy % k and the value is incremented by 1 if the key already exists in `res_map`, otherwise it is set to 1. The state of `candy_array` remains the same, and `candy` is still the next candy in the array. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring the coherence of the program.***
