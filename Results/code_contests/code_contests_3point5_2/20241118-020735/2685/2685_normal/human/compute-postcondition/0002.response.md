According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If the array has elements, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `res_map` is an empty dictionary and `res` is 0. To ensure the loop executes, the `candy_array` must have elements, and `candy` is the first element in the array.
State: **`res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, `candy_array` has elements, `candy` is the first element in the array**
