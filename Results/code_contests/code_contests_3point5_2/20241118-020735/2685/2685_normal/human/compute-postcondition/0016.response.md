Example Answer: 
The value of `res` is incremented by 2. Then, the value of `k - candy % k` is calculated to access the key in the `res_map` dictionary. The value at that key is decreased by 1. The `res_map` dictionary is changed accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a modified dictionary, `res` is incremented by 2, `candy_array` still contains more candies, `candy` is the next candy in the array.
Output State: **`res_map` is a modified dictionary, `res` is incremented by 2, `candy_array` still contains more candies, `candy` is the next candy in the array**
