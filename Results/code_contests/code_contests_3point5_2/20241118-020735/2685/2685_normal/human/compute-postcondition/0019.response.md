According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `candy_array`. If there are more candies in the array, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res_map` has been updated based on the conditions inside the if-else block, `candy_array` remains the same, and `candy` is still the next candy in the array. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `res_map` should have been updated based on the conditions inside the if-else block.
- `candy_array` should still have more candies.
- `candy` should be the next candy in the array.

State: **`res_map` has been updated based on the conditions in the if-else block, `candy_array` still has more candies, `candy` is the next candy in the array**
