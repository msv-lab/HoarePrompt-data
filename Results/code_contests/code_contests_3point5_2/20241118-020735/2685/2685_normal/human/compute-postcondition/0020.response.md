Output State: **If the candy_array is empty, the loop does not execute, and res_map remains an empty dictionary, and res remains 0. If the candy_array is not empty, the loop iterates through each candy in the array. For each candy, it checks if the key (k - candy % k) exists in res_map and if its corresponding value is greater than 0. If the condition is met, res is increased by 2 and the value of res_map[k - candy % k] is decremented by 1. If the condition is not met, a new key-value pair is added to res_map where the key is candy % k, and the value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists or set to 1 if the key is new. After the loop execution, res_map is a dictionary containing the counts of remainders of candies when divided by k, and res is the total count of candies that satisfy the conditions.**
