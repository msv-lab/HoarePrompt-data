Example Answer: 
The value of `res` is increased by 2. The expression `k - candy % k` calculates a key value for the dictionary `res_map`. The key's value in `res_map` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is increased by 2, `candy_array`, `candy` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` is increased by 2, `candy_array`, `candy` remain unchanged**
