Example Answer: 
The code updates the `res_map` dictionary by incrementing the value corresponding to the key `candy % k` by 1 if the key already exists, otherwise it initializes the key with a value of 1. The variables `res_map`, `res`, `candy_array`, and `candy` are affected. Since the initial state of `res_map` is a dictionary, `res` may have been adjusted, `candy_array` still contains more candies, and `candy` is the next candy in the array, the output state is:
Output State: **`res_map` is an updated dictionary, `res` may have been adjusted, `candy_array` still contains more candies, `candy` is the next candy in the array**
