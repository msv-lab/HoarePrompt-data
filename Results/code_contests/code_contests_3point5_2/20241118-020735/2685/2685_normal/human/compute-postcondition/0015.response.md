Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the output state is: `res_map` is a dictionary, `res` may have been adjusted, `candy_array` still contains more candies, `candy` is the next candy in the array, and `res` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`res_map` is a dictionary, `res` may have been adjusted, `candy_array` still contains more candies, `candy` is the next candy in the array, and `res` is incremented by 2**
