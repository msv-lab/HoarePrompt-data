Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the function `func_1`. The logic for updating the `res_map` dictionary is incorrect, as it does not handle the cases where the remainder of the candies is 0 properly. This can lead to incorrect counts of the number of boxes that can be combined into gifts. Additionally, the function does not return any output as per the problem description, which is another deviation from the requirements. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
