The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k`, a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `candy_array`, a list of positive integers. The function iterates through the `candy_array` and updates a dictionary `res_map` based on the remainders of candies when divided by `k`. If a certain condition is met, the total count `res` is increased by 2. However, there are potential issues in the code. The operation of decrementing the value in `res_map` might not work as intended due to missing initialization logic, resulting in a possible KeyError or incorrect behavior. Additionally, the increment logic for the `res_map` values needs to be revised to avoid potential errors. The function does not return any specific output as per the annotations, which might not align with the actual code execution.
