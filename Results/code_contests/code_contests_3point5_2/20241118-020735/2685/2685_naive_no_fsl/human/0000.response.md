Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of boxes Polycarp can give as gifts to k girls. It iterates through the candy_array and keeps track of the remainders of each candy when divided by k. It then checks if the complement of the remainder is present in the map, indicating that there is a pair of boxes that can be combined to form a gift. If so, it increments the result counter by 2 and decrements the count of the complement in the map. If not, it adds the current remainder to the map. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
