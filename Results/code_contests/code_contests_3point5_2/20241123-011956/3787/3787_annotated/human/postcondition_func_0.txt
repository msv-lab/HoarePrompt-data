The function `func_1` reads an integer `K` from the user input and a string `S` consisting of lowercase English letters. If the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`, it prints the entire string `S`. If the length of `S` is greater than `K`, it prints the first `K` characters of `S` followed by '...'. Finally, the function always returns 0. It does not accept any parameters explicitly.
