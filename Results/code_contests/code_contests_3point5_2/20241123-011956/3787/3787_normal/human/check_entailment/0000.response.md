Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer K and a string S from the user input.
- If the length of string S is less than or equal to K, it prints the string S.
- If the length of S exceeds K, it extracts the first K characters in S, appends '...' to the end of them, and prints the result.
- The program ensures K is between 1 and 100 and S is a string of lowercase English letters.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and correctly follows the requirements.
