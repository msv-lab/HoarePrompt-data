Example Answer:
The code prints the first K characters of string S followed by '...'. Since K is an integer between 1 and 100 and S is a string of lowercase English letters with a length greater than K, the output will be the first K characters of S followed by '...'.
Output State: **The first K characters of S followed by '...'**
