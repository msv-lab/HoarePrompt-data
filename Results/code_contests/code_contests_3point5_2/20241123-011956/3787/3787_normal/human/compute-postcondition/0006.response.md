Postcondition: ***K is an integer between 1 and 100, S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. If the length of S is less than or equal to K, the program prints S. Otherwise, the program prints the first K characters of S followed by '...'. The program handles all cases where K is between 1 and 100, and S is a string of lowercase English letters.***
