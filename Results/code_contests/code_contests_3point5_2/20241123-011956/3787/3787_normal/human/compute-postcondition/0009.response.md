Functionality: ** The function func_1 reads an integer K and a string S from the user input. If the length of string S is less than or equal to K, it prints the string S. Otherwise, it prints the first K characters of S followed by '...'. The function returns 0. The program ensures K is between 1 and 100 and S is a string of lowercase English letters. **
