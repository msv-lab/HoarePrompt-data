K is assigned the value of int(input()), where input accepts an integer input. Since the value of K can be any integer between 1 and 100, the output state is K is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and the length of S is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
Output State: **K is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and the length of S is between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
