Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program reads an integer K and a string S from the input and then checks if the length of string S is less than or equal to K. If it is, it prints the string S. Otherwise, it prints the first K characters of S followed by '...'.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement:
1. If the length of S is at most K, it prints S without any change.
2. If the length of S exceeds K, it extracts the first K characters in S, appends '...' to the end of them, and prints the result.

The logic in the program is correct and follows the problem description for all possible inputs. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
