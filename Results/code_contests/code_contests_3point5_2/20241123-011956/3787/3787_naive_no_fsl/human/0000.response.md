Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the length of the input string is at most K, then prints the string without any change. If the length exceeds K, it extracts the first K characters and appends '...' to the end of them. The program handles all constraints mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output.
