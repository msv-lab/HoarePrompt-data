The function reads user input to initialize a 2D list with dimensions n x m filled with zeros. It then iterates k times, updating elements in the 2D list based on conditions derived from subsequent user input. If the input value a is 1, it updates a specific row in the list with a constant value c; otherwise, it updates a specific column. Finally, it prints the 2D list with the updated values. The function does not return any value.
