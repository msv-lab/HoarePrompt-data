Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes a 2D list with all elements as 0, then iterates through the given number of operations and updates the elements in the specified row or column with the given color. Finally, it prints the resulting table after all operations are applied.

The program handles both painting rows and columns with the specified colors, and updates the cells if they have already been painted. The output is formatted correctly as required.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements and there are no potential cases provided where it fails to work as expected. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
