According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The current state does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so adjustments are needed. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be modified as follows:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; k is one less than its original value; a, b, and c are initialized with the input values, and k is greater than or equal to 1; a, b, and c have been updated with the split integer values; a is not equal to 1, and i is set to 0**
