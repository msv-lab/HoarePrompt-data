Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a 2D list `l` is created with all elements initialized to 0; `k` is one less than its original value; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input. If a == 1, the loop assigns the value of `c` to each element in the `b - 1` row of the 2D list `l` for `m` iterations, while keeping `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `a`, `b`, and `c` unchanged. If `m` is 0 or negative, no changes are made to `l`. If a != 1, the loop assigns the value `c` to the element at index `b - 1` in each row of the 2D list `l` for `n` times. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the variables `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.***
