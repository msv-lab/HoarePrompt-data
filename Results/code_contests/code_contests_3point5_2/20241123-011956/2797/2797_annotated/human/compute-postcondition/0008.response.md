According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is positive, `l` is a 2D list initialized to 0, `k` is one less than its original value, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input, `i` is 0. The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is updated to `c`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is positive, `l` is a 2D list initialized to 0, `k` is one less than its original value, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input, `i` is 1**
