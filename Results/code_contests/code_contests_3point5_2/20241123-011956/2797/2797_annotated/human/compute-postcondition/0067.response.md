Output State: **If k is greater than 0, for each iteration of the loop, the values of a, b, and c are assigned by splitting the raw input. If a is equal to 1, the loop updates the elements in the b-1 row of the 2D list l with the value of c for m iterations. If a is not equal to 1, the loop updates the elements in the b-1 column of the 2D list l with the value of c for n iterations. After the loop finishes, n, m, k, a, b, c are positive integers, and the 2D list l is updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to the variables or the list l.**
