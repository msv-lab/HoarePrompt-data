Example Answer:
The value of `k` is decreased by 1. Since all variables are positive integers, the value of `k` will now be one less than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers**
