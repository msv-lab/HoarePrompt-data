Example Answer:
The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is updated to the value of `c`. The previous values of `b` and `c` are used to determine the indices in the 2D list `l`. Since `b` and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the raw input, they are assigned to `l[b - 1][i]`. The value of `i` is 2. Therefore, after execution, the updated value in the 2D list `l` is `c` at index `[b - 1][2]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is positive, `l` is a 2D list initialized to 0, `k` is one less than its original value, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`**
