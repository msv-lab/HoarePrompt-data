Example Answer:
The code assigns the value of `c` to the element at index `i` of the list at index `b - 1` of list `l`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; k is a positive integer; a, b, and c have been updated with the split integer values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; k is a positive integer; a, b, and c have been updated with the split integer values**
