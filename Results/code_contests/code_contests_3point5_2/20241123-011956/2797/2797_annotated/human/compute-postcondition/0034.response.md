Output State: **If m is at least 1, after the loop executes, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; `k` is a positive integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated with the split integer values; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c` for each iteration of the loop. If m is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain the same.**
