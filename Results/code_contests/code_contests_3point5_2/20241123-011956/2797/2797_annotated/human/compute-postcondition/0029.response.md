According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; k is a positive integer; a, b, and c have been updated with the split integer values. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; k is a positive integer; a, b, and c have been updated with the split integer values; `i` is incremented by 1**
