According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is a positive integer, so it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, since `k` is one less than its original value and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, it needs to be adjusted to `k` is a positive integer. Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are already initialized with the input values, so no adjustments are needed for them.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; k is a positive integer; a, b, and c have been updated with the split integer values**
