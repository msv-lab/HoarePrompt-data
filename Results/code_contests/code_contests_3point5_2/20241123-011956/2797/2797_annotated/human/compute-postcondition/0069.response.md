The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the sum of all the elements in a 2D matrix where the value at position (i, j) is i*j for 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. The function then returns the k-th smallest element in the matrix. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates the sum of elements in a 2D matrix based on the given conditions and returns the k-th smallest element in the matrix.**
