According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is one less than its original value. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a 2D list `l` is created with all elements initialized to 0; `k` is one less than its original value; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; and `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
