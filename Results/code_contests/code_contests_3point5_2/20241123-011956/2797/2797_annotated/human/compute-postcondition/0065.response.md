Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers. If `a` is equal to 1, for each iteration of the loop with range `m`, the value of `c` is assigned to the element at index `b - 1` of the inner list of `l`. If `m` is 0 or negative, no changes occur. If `a` is not equal to 1, for each iteration of the loop with range `n`, the value of `c` is assigned to the element at index `b - 1` of the outer list of `l`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, maintaining the original values of the variables.***
