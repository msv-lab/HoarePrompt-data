According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values obtained from input. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values obtained from input**
