According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `m` is positive ensures that the loop will execute. In addition, `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is positive, `l` is a 2D list initialized to 0, `k` is one less than its original value, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input, `i` is 0**
