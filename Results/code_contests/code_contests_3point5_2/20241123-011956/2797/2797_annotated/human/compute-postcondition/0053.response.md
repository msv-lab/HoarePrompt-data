Example Answer:
The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k-1` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `i` is increased by 1, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `i` is increased by 1, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`**
