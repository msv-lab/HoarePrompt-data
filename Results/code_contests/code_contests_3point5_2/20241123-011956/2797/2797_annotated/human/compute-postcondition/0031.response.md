According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; `k` is a positive integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated with the split integer values; `i` is incremented by 1; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than `m+1` as the loop starts from 0. Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; `k` is a positive integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated with the split integer values; `i` is incremented by 1; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`; `i` is less than `m+1`**
