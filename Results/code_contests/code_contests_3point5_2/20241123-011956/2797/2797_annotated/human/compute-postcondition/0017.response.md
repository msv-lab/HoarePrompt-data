According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is adjusted to its original value, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 0, and the value at index `i` and index `b - 1` of `l` is assigned the value `c`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is adjusted to its original value, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value at index `i` and index `b - 1` of `l` is assigned the value `c`**
