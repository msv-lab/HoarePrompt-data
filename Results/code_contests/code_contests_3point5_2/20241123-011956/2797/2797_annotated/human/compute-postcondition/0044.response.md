Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. If `a` is equal to 1 and `m` is at least 1, after the loop executes, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; `k` is a positive integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated with the split integer values; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c` for each iteration of the loop. If `a` is equal to 1 but `m` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain the same. If `a` is not equal to 1, the loop will update the values in the list `l` at index `i` at position `b - 1` with the value of `c` for each iteration. The loop will execute `n` times, updating the list `l` accordingly. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and no changes will be made to the list `l`.***
