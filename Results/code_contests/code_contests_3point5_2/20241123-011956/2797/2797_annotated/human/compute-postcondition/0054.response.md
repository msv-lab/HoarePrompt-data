According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `i` is increased by 1, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the increase, so `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `i` is increased by 1 and assigned the value `i + 1`, `l[b - 1][i + 1]` is assigned the value `c`**
