Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; k is one less than its original value; a, b, and c are initialized with the input values, and k is greater than or equal to 1; a, b, and c have been updated with the split integer values; a is not equal to 1. The value at the index `b - 1` of the list `l` at index `i` is updated to the value of `c`.**
