According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is positive, `l` is a 2D list initialized to 0, `k` is one less than its original value, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increase `i` by 1: `i` is now 3
- No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is positive, `l` is a 2D list initialized to 0, `k` is one less than its original value, `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input, `i` is 3, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`**
