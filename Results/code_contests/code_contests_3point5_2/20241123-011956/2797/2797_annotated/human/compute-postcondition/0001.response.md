Example Answer: 
A 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, so the list `l` will have `n` rows and `m` columns filled with zeros. The variable `k` is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a 2D list `l` is created with all elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a 2D list `l` is created with all elements initialized to 0**
