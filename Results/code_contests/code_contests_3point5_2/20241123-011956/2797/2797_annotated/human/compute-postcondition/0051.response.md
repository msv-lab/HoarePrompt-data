Example Answer:
`l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`. The values of `b` and `i` are used to access a specific element in the list `l`, and that element is then assigned the value of `c`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values obtained from input**
