According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c have been updated with split integer values; k is its original value; a is not equal to 1; the value at index `b` of the list `l` at index `i` is updated to a new value; `b` and `c` have been incremented by 2. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `n` so `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; k is its original value; a, b, and c have been updated with the split integer values; a is not equal to 1; the value at index `b` of the list `l` at index `i` is updated to a new value; `b` and `c` have been incremented by 2; `i` is incremented by 1**
