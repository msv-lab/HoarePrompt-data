Example Answer:
The value of `l` at index `b - 1` and index `i` is assigned the value of `c`. The previous values of `l`, `b`, `i`, and `c` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values obtained from input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values obtained from input**
