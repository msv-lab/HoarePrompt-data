According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `a` is equal to 1, `m` should be positive.
2. If `a` is not equal to 1, `n` should be positive.
3. `k-1` should be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers.**
