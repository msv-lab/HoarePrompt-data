According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k-1` is a positive integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `i` is increased by 1**
