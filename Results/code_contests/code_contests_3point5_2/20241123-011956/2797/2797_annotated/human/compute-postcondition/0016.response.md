Example Answer: 
The value of `l` at index `i` and index `b - 1` is assigned the value of `c`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is adjusted to its original value, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 0, and the value at index `i` and index `b - 1` of `l` is assigned the value `c`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is adjusted to its original value, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 0, and the value at index `i` and index `b - 1` of `l` is assigned the value `c`**
