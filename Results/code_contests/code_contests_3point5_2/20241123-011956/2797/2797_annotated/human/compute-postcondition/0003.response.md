Example Answer:
The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since `k` is a positive integer, after execution, `k` will be one less than its original value. The other variables and the 2D list `l` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; a 2D list `l` is created with all elements initialized to 0; `k` is one less than its original value**
