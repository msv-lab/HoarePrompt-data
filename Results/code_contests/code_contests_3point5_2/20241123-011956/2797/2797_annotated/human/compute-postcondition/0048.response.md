According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is at least 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values obtained from the input, they need to be adjusted based on the input values. Additionally, `n` and `k-1` being positive integers can remain unchanged.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values obtained from input**
