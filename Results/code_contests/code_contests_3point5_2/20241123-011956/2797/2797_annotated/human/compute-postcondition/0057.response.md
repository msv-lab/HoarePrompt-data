According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, `n` should be greater than 0 and `i` should be 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 0**
