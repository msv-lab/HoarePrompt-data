According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `m+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; `k` is a positive integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated with the split integer values; `i` is incremented by 1; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`; `i` is less than `m+1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted by incrementing it by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the raw input; `k` is a positive integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated with the split integer values; `i` is incremented by 2; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`; `i` is less than `m+1`**
