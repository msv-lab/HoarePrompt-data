According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `k` are already positive integers, `l` is a `n x m` 2D list initialized with 0s, `k` is `k-1`, `a` is equal to 1. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is to ensure that `m` is greater than 0. 
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a `n x m` 2D list initialized with 0s; `k` is `k-1`; `a` is equal to 1; `m` is greater than 0**
