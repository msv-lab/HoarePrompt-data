Example Answer: 
The value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned as `c`. The values of other variables remain the same as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned as `c.
Output State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned as `c**
