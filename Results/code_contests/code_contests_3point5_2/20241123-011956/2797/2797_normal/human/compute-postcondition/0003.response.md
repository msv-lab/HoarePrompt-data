Example Answer:
The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since `k` is a positive integer, after execution, `k` will be `k-1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list initialized with 0s of size `n x m`, and `k` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list initialized with 0s of size `n x m`, `k` is `k-1`**
