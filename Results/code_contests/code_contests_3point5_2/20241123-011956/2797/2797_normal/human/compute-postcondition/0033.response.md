According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `i` is 3, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c**`
