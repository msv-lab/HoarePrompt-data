Output State: **If the conditions are met and the loop executes, the 2D list `l` will be updated according to the specified conditions. If the loop does not execute, the state of the program remains unchanged. After the loop finishes, `k` is decremented by the number of times the loop executed. The formatted 2D list `l` will be printed as described in the code snippet.**
