According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `k`, `n`, and `m` are positive integers, `m` is greater than 0. `k-1` and `b` are positive integers, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with values input by splitting the raw input, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values input by splitting the raw input, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`, `i` is incremented by 1**
