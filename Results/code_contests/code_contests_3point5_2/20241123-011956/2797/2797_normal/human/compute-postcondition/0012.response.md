According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `m` after the adjustment. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a `n x m` 2D list initialized with 0s; `k` is `k-1`; `a` is equal to 1; `m` is greater than 0; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`; `i` is increased by 1**
