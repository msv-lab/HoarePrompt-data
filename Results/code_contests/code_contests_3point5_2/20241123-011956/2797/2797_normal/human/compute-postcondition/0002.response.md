Example Answer:
The code iterates through each element of the 2D list `l` and prints its value. However, since the print statement is commented out, it will not display anything on the output. Therefore, the values of the variables and the 2D list `l` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list initialized with 0s of size `n x m`**
