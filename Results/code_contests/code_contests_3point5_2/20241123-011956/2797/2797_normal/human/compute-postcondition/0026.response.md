Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. If `a` is equal to 1, then for all valid indices in the 2D list `l`, the value at index `b-1` in each row will be `c`. If `a` is not equal to 1, then for all valid indices in the 2D list `l`, the value at index `b-1` in each row will be `c`**
