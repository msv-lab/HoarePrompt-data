According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `m+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `m+1` after incrementing. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values input by splitting the raw input, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `m+2`**
