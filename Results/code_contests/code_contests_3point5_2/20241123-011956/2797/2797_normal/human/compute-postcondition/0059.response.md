According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 0, and the value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned as `c`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned as `c**`.
