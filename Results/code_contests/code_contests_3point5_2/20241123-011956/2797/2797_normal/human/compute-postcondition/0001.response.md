Example Answer:
A 2D list `l` is created with dimensions `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, so the dimensions of the list are valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list initialized with 0s of size `n x m`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a 2D list initialized with 0s of size `n x m`**
