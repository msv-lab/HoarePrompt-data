According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `m` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `k` is decreased by 1 doesn't ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k`, `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values input by splitting the raw input, and `m` is greater than 0.
State: **`k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k-1` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values input by splitting the raw input**
