Example Answer:
The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `i` is 2, `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`**
