Postcondition: ***For all valid indices in the 2D list `l`, the value at index `b-1` in each row is `c`. `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. If `a == 1`, the value at index `b-1` in each row is set to `c` for all rows. If `a != 1`, the value at index `b-1` in each column is set to `c` for all columns. If `m` is 0, no changes are made to `l`. After the execution of the if else block, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain positive integers. If `n` is 0 or negative, no changes are made to `l`.***
