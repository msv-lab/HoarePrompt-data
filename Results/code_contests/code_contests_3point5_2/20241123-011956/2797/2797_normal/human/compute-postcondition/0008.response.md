According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a `n x m` 2D list initialized with 0s; `k` is `k-1`; `a` is equal to 1; `m` is greater than 0; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` should be checked if it is greater than the new value of `i` to ensure the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `l` is a `n x m` 2D list initialized with 0s; `k` is `k-1`; `a` is equal to 1; `m` is greater than 0; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`; `i` is increased by 1**
