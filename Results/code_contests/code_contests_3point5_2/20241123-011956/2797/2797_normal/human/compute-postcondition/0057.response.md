According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `k` is decreased by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, and `i` is 0.
State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 0**
