According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned as `c. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. `k` should be decreased by 1 again.
2. `i` should be incremented by 1.
3. No changes need to be made to `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` since their conditions are already met.
State: **`k` is decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `i` is 2, and the value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned as `c**.
