According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, and the condition for all valid indices in the 2D list `l` is met, the value at index `[i][b - 1]` in list `l` is now equal to `c`.**
