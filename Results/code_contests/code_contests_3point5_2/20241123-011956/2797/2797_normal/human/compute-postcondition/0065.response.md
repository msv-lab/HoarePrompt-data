Postcondition: ***`k` is decreased by the number of times the loop executed, `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. If `a` is equal to 1, `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and `c` is assigned to each element in the `b`-th row of the 2D list `l` for `m` times. If `m` is less than or equal to 0, no assignment occurs. If `a` is not equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and `c` is assigned to the element at index `b - 1` in each sublist of `l`. If `n` is 0 or negative, no assignment occurs. After the loop, `k`, `n`, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain positive integers, and `a` is not equal to 1.***
