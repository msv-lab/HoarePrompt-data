Example Answer:
The value at index `[i][b - 1]` in the 2D list `l` is updated to `c`. The condition for all valid indices in the list `l` remains met. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, the value at index `[i][b - 1]` in list `l` is now equal to `c`, `i` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, the value at index `[i][b - 1]` in list `l` is now equal to `c`, `i` is less than `n`**
