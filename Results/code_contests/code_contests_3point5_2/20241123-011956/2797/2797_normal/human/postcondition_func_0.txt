The function `func` reads input from the user to initialize variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. It then creates a 2D list `l` of size `n x m` filled with zeroes. Subsequently, it enters a loop that performs different operations based on input values `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `a` is 1, it sets the values in the b-th row of `l` to `c`, otherwise, it sets the values at index `b-1` in each sublist of `l` to `c`. The function prints the updated 2D list `l` after the loop finishes executing. The function does not return any value.
