Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes the dimensions of the sheet and the number of operations as input. Then it initializes a list to represent the table with all cells colored 0. It then iterates through each operation and updates the table accordingly by painting the specified rows or columns with the given color. Finally, it prints the resulting table.

The program follows the problem description accurately by correctly updating the table based on the operations provided. It handles both row and column painting operations as expected. Additionally, it prints the final table in the required format. Since the code covers all aspects of the problem description and there are no cases identified where it fails to produce the correct output, the correctness is evaluated as True.
