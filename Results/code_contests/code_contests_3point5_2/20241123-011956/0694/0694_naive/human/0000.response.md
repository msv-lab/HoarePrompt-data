Correctness: **False**

The given program does not produce the correct output as described in the problem statement. The program is supposed to print a frame made of '#' and '.', but instead, it prints each character in a separate line, which does not create the desired frame structure. The program needs to print the characters horizontally and handle the spacing correctly to form the frame.
