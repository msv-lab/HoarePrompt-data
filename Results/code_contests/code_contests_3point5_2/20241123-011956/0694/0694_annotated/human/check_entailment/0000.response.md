Correctness: **False**

The program logic is incorrect. It only prints a single character ('#' or '.') on each line instead of building the frame as described in the problem. The program should print the entire frame for each dataset, not just individual characters. Additionally, the logic to print '#' only for the border of the frame is not correctly implemented.
