Postcondition: ***`h`, `w`, `i` are integers where `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `h`. If either `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, if none of the mentioned conditions are met, the character '.' is printed.***
