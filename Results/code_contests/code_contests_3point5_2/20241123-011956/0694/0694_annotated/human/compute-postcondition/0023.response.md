According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, if `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1, then `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, and `j` is 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 0**
