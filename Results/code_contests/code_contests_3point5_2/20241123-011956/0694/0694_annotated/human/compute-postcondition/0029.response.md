According to the code, the loop will execute while `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, and `j` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
