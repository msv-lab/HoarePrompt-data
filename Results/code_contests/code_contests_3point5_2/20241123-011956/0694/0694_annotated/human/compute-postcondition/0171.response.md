According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `i` is incremented and `i` is less than `h`.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w` and `i` should be reset to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` remains greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `i` is 0**
