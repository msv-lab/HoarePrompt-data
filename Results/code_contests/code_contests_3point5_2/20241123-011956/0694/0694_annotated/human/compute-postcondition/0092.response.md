Postcondition: ***`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers where `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `h`. `j` is the next value in the range [0, w). If i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints '.' representing the overall execution of the if-else block with all edge cases considered.***
