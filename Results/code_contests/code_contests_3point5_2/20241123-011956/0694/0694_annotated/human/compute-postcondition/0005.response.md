According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `w` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `h` is greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `h` needs to be greater than 0 and `w` needs to be at least 1. Additionally, `j` should be 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 0**
