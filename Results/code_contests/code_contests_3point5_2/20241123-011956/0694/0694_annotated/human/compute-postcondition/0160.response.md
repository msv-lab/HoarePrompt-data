According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `w`. If `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 1, `w` remains greater than 0, and `j` is `w-1`. To execute the loop one more time, the `i` should be incremented and `i` should be less than `h`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` should be incremented and `i` should be less than `h`.
State: **`h` remains greater than 1, `w` remains greater than 0, `j` is `w-1`, `i` is incremented and `i` is less than `h`**
