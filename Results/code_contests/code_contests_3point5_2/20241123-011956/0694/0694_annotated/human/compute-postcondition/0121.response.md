Example Answer:
`h` and `w` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `h` and `w` are dependent on the user input, so the output state is: `h` and `w` are assigned values from the user input.
Output State: **`h` and `w` are assigned values from the user input**
