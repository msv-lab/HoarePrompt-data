Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement inside the loop body. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions inside the loop body that check for `i` being 0, `j` being 0, `i` being equal to `h - 1`, or `j` being equal to `w - 1` need to be evaluated. 
Given that `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is not 0, `j` is not 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1.`
Therefore, the state remains unchanged for `h`, `w`, and `j`, and the loop will execute one more time.
Output State: **`h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged.**
