Output State: **If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1, then after the loop executes, the values of `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. The loop will not execute if `w` is less than or equal to 0.**
