According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `h`, and `w`. If `i` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `h`. No other conditions are provided that would prevent the loop from executing again, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: If `i` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to `h`, the loop does not execute. For each iteration, the program prints '#' when `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. Otherwise, the program prints '.'. `i` is less than `h`.**
