Output State: If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1, then after the loop executes, `h`, `w`, and `j` will remain unchanged. The loop will print '#' if either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. Otherwise, it will print '.'. If `h` is 0 or `w` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and no output will be generated.
