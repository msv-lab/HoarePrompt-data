According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `w` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `h` is greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute. So, to adjust the state before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is unchanged, `i` is 0**
