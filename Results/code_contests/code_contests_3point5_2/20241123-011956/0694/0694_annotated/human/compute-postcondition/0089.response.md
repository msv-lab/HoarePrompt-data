According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `i` are integers where `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `h`. If either `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the loop will not execute again and '#' will be printed. Otherwise, the loop will execute again and '.' will be printed.

Since the conditions mentioned above do not involve `j`, `j` can be any value within the range [0, w). Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `j` should be incremented to the next value in the range [0, w).

State: **`h`, `w`, `i` are integers where `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `h`. `j` is the next value in the range [0, w)**
