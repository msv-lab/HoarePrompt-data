Output State: **If h is greater than 0 and w is at least 1, the loop will execute w times. After each iteration, the loop will print either '#' or '.' based on the conditions. If i is 0, j is 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, '#' is printed; otherwise, '.' is printed. The variables h, w, and j remain unchanged throughout the loop, while i is adjusted according to the loop conditions.**
