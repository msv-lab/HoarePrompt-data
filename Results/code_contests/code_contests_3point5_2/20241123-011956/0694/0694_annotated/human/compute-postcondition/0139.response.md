According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w+1`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w**
