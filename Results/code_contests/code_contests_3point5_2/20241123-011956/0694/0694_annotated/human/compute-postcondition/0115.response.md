According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` and `j` are integers, where `j` is less than `w`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w-1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` and `j` are integers, where `j` is less than `w-1**
