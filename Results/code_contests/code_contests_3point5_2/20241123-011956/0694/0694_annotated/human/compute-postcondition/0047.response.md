According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` remains unchanged, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `w`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` should be less than `w`.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is 0**
