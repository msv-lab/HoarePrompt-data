According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `j` needs to be less than `w - 1.`
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 2**
