Example Answer:
`h` and `w` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input separated by spaces. The values of `h` and `w` are constrained to be integers between 3 and 300 as per the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: h and w are integers where 3 ≤ h ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ w ≤ 300.
Output State: **h and w are integers where 3 ≤ h ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ w ≤ 300**
