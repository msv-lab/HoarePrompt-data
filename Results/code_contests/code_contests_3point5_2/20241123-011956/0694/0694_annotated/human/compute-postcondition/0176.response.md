Output State: **The loop prints either '#' or '.' based on the conditions i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, or j == w - 1. The loop will continue executing as long as i is less than h, and j ranges from 0 to w-1. If i is equal to 0, j is equal to 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. If h is less than or equal to 1 or w is less than 1, the loop won't execute.**
