Functionality: **The function continuously prompts the user to input two integers, h and w, until h and w are both 0. For each pair of h and w greater than 0, the function prints a rectangle of '#' and '.' characters based on the dimensions provided. If either h or w is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.**
