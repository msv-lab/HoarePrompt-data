According to the code, the loop can execute if `h` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` is a value between 3 and 300, so there is no need to adjust it. However, `w` is not mentioned in the loop condition, so it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is any value between 3 and 300**
