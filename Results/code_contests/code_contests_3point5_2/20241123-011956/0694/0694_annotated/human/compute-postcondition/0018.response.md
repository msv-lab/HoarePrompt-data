Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the code prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block, and the printed character depends on the conditions stated.***
