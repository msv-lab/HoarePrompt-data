According to the code, the loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, and `j` will remain unchanged. The loop will print '#' if either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1; otherwise, it will print '.'. If `h` is 0 or `w` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and no output will be generated. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is unchanged, `i` needs to be adjusted accordingly based on the loop conditions**
