The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the maximum area of a rectangle with dimensions `h` and `w`, where `h` and `w` are integers satisfying the constraint 3 ≤ h ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ w ≤ 300. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the maximum area of a rectangle given the constraints on the dimensions. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the maximum area of a rectangle with dimensions `h` and `w`, where h and w are integers satisfying the constraints 3 ≤ h ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ w ≤ 300.**
