According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 2. Since the loop can execute again, the only state that needs adjustment is `j`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to 3.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is 3**
