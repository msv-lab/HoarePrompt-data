According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `w`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` and `j` are integers, `j` is less than `w**
