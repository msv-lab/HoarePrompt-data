According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `h` remains greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `i` is incremented and `i` is less than `h`. If the loop is to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`, so `j` should be incremented. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: `h` remains greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `i` is incremented and `i` is less than `h`
