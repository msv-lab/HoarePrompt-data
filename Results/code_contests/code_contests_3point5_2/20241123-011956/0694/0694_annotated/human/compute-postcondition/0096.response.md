Postcondition: ***`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers where `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is less than `w. If `i` is equal to 0 or `j` is equal to 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints '#'. Otherwise, the program prints a period '.'.***
