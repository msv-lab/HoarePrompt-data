According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. Since `j` is 1, the loop can execute another time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 2**
