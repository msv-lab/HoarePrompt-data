According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `w`. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, if `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1, then the values of `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `w` needs to be at least 1 and no other states need adjustment.
State: **If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1, then `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged.**
