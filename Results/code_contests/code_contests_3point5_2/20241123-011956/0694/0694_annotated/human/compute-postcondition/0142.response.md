According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than or equal to 0. Since the loop did not execute due to `w` being less than or equal to 0, we only need to focus on adjusting `h` for the next iteration. Therefore, `h` needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes one more time.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 0**
