According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. Since `h` and `i` are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0 and `i` is less than `h`.
State: **`h` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`**
