Output State: 
- `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0. 
- If either `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. 
- If none of these conditions are met, '.' is printed.
- The loop will execute `w` times, printing '#' or '.' based on the conditions mentioned above. 
- If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and no characters will be printed.
