According to the code, the loop can execute if `w` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` is greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0**
