According to the code, the loop will only execute if `h` is greater than 0, as the range starts from 0 and goes up to (h-1). If `h` is 0, the loop will not execute. Thus, in order for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0, `w` and `j` are integers, and their values remain unchanged.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` and `j` are integers, their values remain unchanged**
