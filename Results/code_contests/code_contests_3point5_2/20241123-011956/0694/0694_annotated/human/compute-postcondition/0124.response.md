According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h`. If `h` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `h` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is assigned values from user input**
