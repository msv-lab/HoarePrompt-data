According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is less than `w`, `i` is 0. To adjust the state for the next iteration, `j` needs to be updated to be `j + 1`.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is less than `w + 1`, `i` is 0**
