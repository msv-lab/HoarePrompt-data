Output State: 

If `h` and `w` are both equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times printing either '#' or '.' based on the conditions `i == 0`, `j == 0`, `i == h - 1`, or `j == w - 1`. After the loop execution, `h` remains greater than 1, `w` remains greater than 0, and `j` is `w-1`. If `h` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.

Output State: **Loop prints either '#' or '.' based on the conditions i == 0, j == 0, i == h - 1, or j == w - 1. The loop continues executing as long as i is less than h, and j ranges from 0 to w-1. If i is equal to 0, j is equal to 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. If h is less than or equal to 1 or w is less than 1, the loop won't execute.**
