Example Answer:
The values of `h` and `w` are assigned by mapping the input values to integers. The values of `h` and `w` could be any integers based on the input provided. The value of `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` and `w` are assigned new integer values based on the input, `j` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`h` and `w` are assigned new integer values based on the input, `j` remains unchanged**
