According to the code, for the loop to execute, the loop variable `j` must be within the range of 0 to `w` exclusive. In this case, `w` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `w-1`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 0 to satisfy the loop condition. Additionally, since `j` is the loop variable, it is the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`h` remains greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `i` is incremented and `i` is less than `h`**
