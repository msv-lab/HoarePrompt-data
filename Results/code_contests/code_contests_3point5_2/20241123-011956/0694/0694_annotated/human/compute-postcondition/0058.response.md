According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variables `i`, `h`, and `w`. If `i` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is at least 1, the loop will execute `w` times. Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If h is greater than 0 and w is at least 1, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `h` and `w` remain the same**
