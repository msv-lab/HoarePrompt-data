According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` is less than `w`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w+1**`
