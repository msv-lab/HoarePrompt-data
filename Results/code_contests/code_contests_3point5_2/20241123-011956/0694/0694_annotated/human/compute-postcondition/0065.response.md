According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `h` is greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, for the loop to be executed, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
