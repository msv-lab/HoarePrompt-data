According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `h`, and `w`. If `i` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `h`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`**
