Output State: If h and w are both greater than 0, the loop will continue to execute, printing '#' when i is 0, j is 0, i is equal to h - 1, or j is equal to w - 1, and '.' otherwise. The values of h, w, and j remain unchanged after the loop. If either h or w is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.
