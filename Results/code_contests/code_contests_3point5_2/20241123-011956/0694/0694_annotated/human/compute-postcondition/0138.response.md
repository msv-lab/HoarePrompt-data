Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `w+1. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
