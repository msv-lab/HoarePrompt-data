Since the loop iterates over the range of `w`, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers where `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is less than `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w` but greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w`, `i`, `j` are integers where `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `w`**
