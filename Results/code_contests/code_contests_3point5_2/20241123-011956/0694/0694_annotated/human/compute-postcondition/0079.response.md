According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, and `j` is always 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `w`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` should be less than `w`.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `w`**
