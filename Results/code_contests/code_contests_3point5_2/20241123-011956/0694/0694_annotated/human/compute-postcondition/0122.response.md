Example Answer: 
The values of the variables `h` and `w` are assigned by user input, but the code snippet `break` does not affect the values of these variables. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or if statement, but in this case, there is no loop or if statement to break out of. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`h` and `w` are assigned values from the user input**
