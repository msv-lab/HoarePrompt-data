According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the previous iteration, `h` remains greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w` but greater than 0.
State: **`h` remains greater than 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0**
