Output State: **If `h` is greater than 1 and `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times. The loop prints '#' if `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` equals `h - 1` or `j` equals `w - 1`, otherwise it prints '.'. After the loop execution, `h` remains greater than 1, `w` remains greater than 0, and `j` is `w-1`. If `h` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.**
