According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 0. Since `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be 1.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 1**
