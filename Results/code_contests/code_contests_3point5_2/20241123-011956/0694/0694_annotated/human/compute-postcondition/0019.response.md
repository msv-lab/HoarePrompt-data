According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` and its relationship with `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, and `j` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `w`, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is less than `w`**
