According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. Since `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
