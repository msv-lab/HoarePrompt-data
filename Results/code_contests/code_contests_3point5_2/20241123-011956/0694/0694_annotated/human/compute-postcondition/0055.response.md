According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is less than `w + 1`, `i` is 0. Since `j` is the iterating variable, it needs to be adjusted to `j` is w. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is w, `i` is 0**
