Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is at least 1, `j` is less than `w + 1`, `i` is 0. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is h - 1, or `j` is w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. The variables `h`, `w`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
