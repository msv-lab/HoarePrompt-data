According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` and `j` are integers. If either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then print '#'. Otherwise, print '.'. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. 
State: **`i` and `j` are integers, `j` is less than `w`.**
