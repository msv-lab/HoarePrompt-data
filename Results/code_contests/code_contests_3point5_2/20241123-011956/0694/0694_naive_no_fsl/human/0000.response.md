Correctness: **False**

The given program does not draw the frame as described in the problem statement. The program prints each character on a new line instead of printing them on the same line to create the frame. Additionally, it prints '#' for every side of the frame, including the corners, which is not the correct way to draw the frame.

For example, when the input is "3 4", the expected output should be:
```
####
#..#
####
```
But the program's output will be:
```
#
#
#
#
.
.
.
.
#
#
#
#
.
.
.
.
#
#
#
``` 

This example shows that the program does not work correctly for the given problem description, making the correctness **False**.
