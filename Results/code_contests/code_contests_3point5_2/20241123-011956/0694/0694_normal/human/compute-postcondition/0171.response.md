According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is x+1, `h` is y, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is the current value + 1. If `i` equals 0 or `j` equals 0 or `i` equals h - 1 or `j` equals w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next value.
State: **`i` is x+1, `h` is y, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is the current value + 2**
