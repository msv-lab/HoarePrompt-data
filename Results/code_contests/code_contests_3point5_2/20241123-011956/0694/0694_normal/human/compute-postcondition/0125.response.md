According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0, so the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0. Additionally, before the loop starts, the loop variable `j` is initialized to 0. 
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
