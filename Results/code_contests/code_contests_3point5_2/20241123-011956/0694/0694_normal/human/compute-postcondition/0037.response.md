According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers satisfying 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is less than W. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than W. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **H and W are integers satisfying 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, j is less than W**
