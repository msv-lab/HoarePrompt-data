According to the code, the loop will always execute as it is a `while True` loop. The conditions within the loop determine the behavior of the program. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions that need to be met are:
- `h` should be 3 or greater
- `w` should be 1 or greater

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **No changes in the state as the loop will always execute**
