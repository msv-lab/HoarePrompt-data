According to the code, the loop will iterate through the range of `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 3 or greater and `w` is 1 or greater. If `h` is 3 or greater, the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: If `h` is 3 or greater and `w` is 1 or greater**
