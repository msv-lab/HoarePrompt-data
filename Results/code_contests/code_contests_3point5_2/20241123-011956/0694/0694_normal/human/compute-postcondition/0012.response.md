Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the character '#' to the console. It does not affect the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, w is greater than 0.
Output State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, w is greater than 0**
