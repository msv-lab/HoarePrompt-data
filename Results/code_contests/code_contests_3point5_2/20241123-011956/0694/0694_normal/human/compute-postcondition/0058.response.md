According to the code, the loop executes for the range of `i` from 0 to `h`, where `h` is the height. If `i` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is equal to `w - 1`. Based on the condition provided, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. Since `j = w - 1`, we can infer that `j` is not equal to `w - 1` and needs to be adjusted as well. No other states need adjustment.
State: **If i is 3, j is not equal to w - 1, h and w remain the same**
