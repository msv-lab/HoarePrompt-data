Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the first integer value from the input, and `w` is assigned the second integer value from the input. The values of `h` and `w` are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is the first input integer, and w is the second input integer.
Output State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is the first input integer, and w is the second input integer**
