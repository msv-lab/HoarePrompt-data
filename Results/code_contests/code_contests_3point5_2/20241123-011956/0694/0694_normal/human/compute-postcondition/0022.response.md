According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `h`. If `i` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop does not execute, so `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop does not execute. H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, j is equal to w - 1, and w is greater than 0**
