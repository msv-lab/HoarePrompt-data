According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 1**
