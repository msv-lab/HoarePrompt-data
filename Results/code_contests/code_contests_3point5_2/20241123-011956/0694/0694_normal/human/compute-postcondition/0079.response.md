According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` remains 0, and `j` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`, so it should be adjusted to `j` is less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` remains 0, `j` is less than `w`**
