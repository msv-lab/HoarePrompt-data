According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `h` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `h` and `w` both being integers greater than or equal to 3 ensures the loop can execute. The variables `i` and `j` don't affect the loop execution directly but are used as loop counters. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` and `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `w - 1`.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `w - 1**.
