According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is less than `w`. If the loop is to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. All other states remain the same.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is less than `w + 1**
