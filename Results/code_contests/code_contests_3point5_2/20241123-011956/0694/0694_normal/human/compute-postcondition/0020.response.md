Output State: **The loop prints a grid of '#' and '.' characters, where '#' is printed at the border of the grid (i.e., when i is 0 or j is 0 or i is h - 1 or j is w - 1), and '.' is printed for all other positions. The loop will not execute if either h or w is less than or equal to 2. After the loop executes, H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 0, j is equal to w - 1, and w is greater than 0.**
