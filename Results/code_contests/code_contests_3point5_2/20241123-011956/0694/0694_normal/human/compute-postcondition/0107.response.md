According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater, and `j` is 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w-1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **h is 3 or greater, w is 1 or greater, j is less than w-1**
