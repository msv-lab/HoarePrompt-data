According to the code, the loop will always execute as the range function will generate values from 0 to w-1. Therefore, the loop will always run even if w is 3. However, to understand the state before the loop starts:

State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 3 <= h <= 300, `w` is an integer satisfying 3 <= w <= 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to w - 1**
