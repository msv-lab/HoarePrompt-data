Example Answer:
The code simply prints a dot "." on the screen. The variables H, W, h, i, and j are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: H and W are integers satisfying 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, j is less than w - 1.
Output State: **H and W are integers satisfying 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, j is less than w - 1**
