According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, and `j` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. 
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 3**
