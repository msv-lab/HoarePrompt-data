According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `w` is greater than 0. Since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `w-1`, `w` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `h` and `w` are greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted so that `h` and `w` are both 3 or greater.
State: **`h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater**
