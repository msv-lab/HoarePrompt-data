According to the code, the loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0. If `h` is 0, the loop will break. Since `w` is not used in the loop condition, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than 0.
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is an integer**
