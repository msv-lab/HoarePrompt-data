Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` is the number of times the outer loop has executed, `j` is equal to `w - 1`. If `h` and `w` are both 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` after the execution of the if-else block.***
