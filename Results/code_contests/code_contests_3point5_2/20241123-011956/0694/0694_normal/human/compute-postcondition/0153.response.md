According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is less than `w**
