According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `H` and `W` are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `w` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `w` + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, w is greater than 0**
