According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 0 to `w`. Since `w` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `h` and `w` are already integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `w - 1`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `w - 1**
