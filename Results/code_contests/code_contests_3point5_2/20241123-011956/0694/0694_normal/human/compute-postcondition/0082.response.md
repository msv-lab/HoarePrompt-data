According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `w`. If both `h` and `w` are greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, no characters are printed as the loop does not execute when `h` or `w` is less than 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, both `h` and `w` need to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **No characters are printed as the loop does not execute when `h` or `w` is less than 3, `h` and `w` are greater than or equal to 3**
