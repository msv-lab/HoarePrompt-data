Postcondition: ***`h`, `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then a `#` is printed. Otherwise, a `.` is printed. If the conditions are not met, the program does not print anything. `i` remains 0, and `j` remains less than `w - 1`.***
