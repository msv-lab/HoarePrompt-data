According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers satisfying 3 <= h <= 300, 3 <= w <= 300, h is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is less than w - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers satisfying 3 <= h <= 300, 3 <= w <= 300, h is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is w - 1**
