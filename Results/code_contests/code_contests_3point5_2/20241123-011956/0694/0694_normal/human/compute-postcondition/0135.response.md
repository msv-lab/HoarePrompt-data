According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 1. This means that the loop will execute one more time. Since no other conditions are mentioned, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `j` is 2**
