According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `w` and `j`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater, and `j` is less than `w + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w + 1` but greater than or equal to `w` to move to the next iteration of the loop. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater, and `j` is equal to `w`**
