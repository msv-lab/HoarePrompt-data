According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater, and `j` is less than `w`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **h is 3 or greater, w is 1 or greater, j is less than w + 1**
