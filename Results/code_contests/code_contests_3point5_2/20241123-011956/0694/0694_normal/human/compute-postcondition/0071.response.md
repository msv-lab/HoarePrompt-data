According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `w - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w - 1`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `w - 1`.
State: **`h` and `w` are integers greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is less than `w - 1`**
