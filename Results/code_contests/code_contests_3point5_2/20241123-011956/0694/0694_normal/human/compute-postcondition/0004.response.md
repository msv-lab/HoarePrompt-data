According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `h`. If h is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since h and w are both integers between 3 and 300, to ensure the loop executes, `h` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, h and w are both 0, so we need to adjust the state to `h` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
