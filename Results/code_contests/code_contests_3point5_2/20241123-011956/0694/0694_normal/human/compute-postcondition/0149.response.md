According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is 0. If the loop is to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 1**
