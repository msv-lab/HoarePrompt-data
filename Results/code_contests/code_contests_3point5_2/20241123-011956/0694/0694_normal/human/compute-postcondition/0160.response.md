According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `h`. If `i` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is x, `h` is y. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be x+1 and `h` should remain the same. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is x+1, `h` is y**
