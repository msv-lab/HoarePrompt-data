Output State: 
- `i` is x+1, `h` is y, `w` is greater than 0. 
- If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is h-1 or `j` is w-1, then the program prints '#'. 
- Otherwise, if none of the conditions are met, the program prints '.' without affecting the variable states.
- The loop will execute `w` times, incrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration.
- If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed.
