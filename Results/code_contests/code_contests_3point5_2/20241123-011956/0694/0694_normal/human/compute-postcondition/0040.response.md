According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop did not execute, so `i` is 1, `h` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop executes, h and w are integers satisfying 3 <= h <= 300, 3 <= w <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 2, and j is equal to w - 1**
