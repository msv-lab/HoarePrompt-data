According to the code, the loop will execute as long as w is greater than 0. The loop will iterate from 0 to w-1. Before the loop starts, i is x+1 and h is y. Therefore, to ensure the loop execution, the states need to be adjusted to `i` is x+1, `h` is y, and `w` is greater than 0. 
State: **`i` is x+1, `h` is y, `w` is greater than 0**
