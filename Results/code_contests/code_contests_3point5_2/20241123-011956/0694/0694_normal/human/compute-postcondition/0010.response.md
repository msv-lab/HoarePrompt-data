Postcondition: ***H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 0, w is greater than 0. If i is 0 or j is 0 or i is h - 1 or j is w - 1, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. In all other cases where the conditions (i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1) are false, the program prints '.'***
