Example Answer: 
The print statement simply outputs a period "." to the console and does not affect the state of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: h, w are integers satisfying 3 <= h <= 300, 3 <= w <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 2, j is w - 1.
Output State: **h, w are integers satisfying 3 <= h <= 300, 3 <= w <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 2, j is w - 1**
