According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **h is 3 or greater, w is 1 or greater, j is less than w**
