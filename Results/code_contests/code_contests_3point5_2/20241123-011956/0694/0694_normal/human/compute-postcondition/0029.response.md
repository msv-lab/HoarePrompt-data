According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `w` exclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` satisfy the conditions 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is equal to `w - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `w - 1`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j is less than w - 1`.
State: **H and W are integers satisfying 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, j is less than w - 1**
