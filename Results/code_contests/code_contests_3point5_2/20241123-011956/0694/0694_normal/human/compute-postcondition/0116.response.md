Output State: If `h` is 3 or greater and `w` is 1 or greater:
- The loop iterates through the range of `w` values.
- If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed.
- Otherwise, the character '.' is printed.
- If `h` is less than 3 or `w` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed.
