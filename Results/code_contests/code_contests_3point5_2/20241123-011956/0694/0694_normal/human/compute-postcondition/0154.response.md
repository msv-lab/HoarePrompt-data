Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints a '#', and it does not affect the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is less than `w.
Output State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is less than `w**
