Postcondition: ***`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is less than `w`. If either `i` equals 0, `j` equals 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, '.' is printed. This covers all possibilities for the values of `i` and `j` in relation to `h` and `w`.***
