According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is less than W - 1. At the end of the last iteration, H and W are integers satisfying 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, j is less than W - 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of j should be less than W. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is j is less than W.
State: **H and W are integers satisfying 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, j is less than W**
