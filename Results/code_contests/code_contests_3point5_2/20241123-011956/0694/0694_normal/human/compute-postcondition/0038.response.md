Output State: **The loop prints a grid of '#' and '.' characters based on the conditions. If the loop executes, it will iterate over the range of w and print '#' if i is 0 or j is 0 or i is equal to h - 1 or j is equal to w - 1, otherwise it will print '.'. If the loop does not execute, h and W are integers satisfying 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, and j is equal to w - 1, where w is greater than 0.**
