According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `H` and `W` are not necessarily relevant for the loop to execute, but since they are provided, we can keep them as they are. The key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0.
State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `w` is greater than 0**
