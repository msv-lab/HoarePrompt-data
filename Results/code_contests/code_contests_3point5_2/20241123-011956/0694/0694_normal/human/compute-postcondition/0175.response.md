According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is x+1, `h` is y, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is the current value + 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than w. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is x+1, `h` is y, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is less than w**
