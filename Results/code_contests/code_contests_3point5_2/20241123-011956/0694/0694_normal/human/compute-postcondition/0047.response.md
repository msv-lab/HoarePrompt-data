According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the value of `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and `w` is between 3 and 300. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w - 1` so that the loop continues. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`h`, `w` are integers satisfying 3 <= h <= 300, 3 <= w <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 2, j is less than w - 1**
