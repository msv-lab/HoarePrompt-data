According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. If `j` is less than `w-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater, and `j` is less than `w-1`. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `w`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater, `j` is less than `w`**
