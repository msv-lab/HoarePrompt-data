Output State: If `h` is 3 or greater and `w` is 1 or greater, the loop will iterate through the range of `w`. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is `h - 1` or `j` is `w - 1`, the program will print '#'. Otherwise, it will print a period '.'. If `h` or `w` is less than 3, the loop will not execute. If `h` and `w` are both 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` after the execution of the if-else block.
