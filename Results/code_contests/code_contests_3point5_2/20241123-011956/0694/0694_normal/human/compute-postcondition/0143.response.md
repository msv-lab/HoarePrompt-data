According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `w`. Before the loop starts, `h`, `w`, and `i` are given. To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments need to be made: `j` starts at 0, `w` is greater than 0.
State: **`h` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0**
