According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` and `w` are integers greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to less than `h`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h`, `w` are integers greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`**
