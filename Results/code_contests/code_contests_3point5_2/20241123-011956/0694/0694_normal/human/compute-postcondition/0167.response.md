According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is x+1, `h` is y, and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`i` is x+1, `h` is y, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is the current value + 1**
