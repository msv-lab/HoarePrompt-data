According to the code, the loop can execute if `h` is 3 or greater and `w` is 1 or greater. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 0, `w` is 0. Since `h` is less than 3 and `w` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `h` should be 3 or greater and `w` should be 1 or greater.
State: **Output State: If `h` is 3 or greater and `w` is 1 or greater, `h` is 3, `w` is 1**
