According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `w` is greater than 0. Since `j` is less than `w`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 0, w is greater than 0.**
