Output State: **If `h` and `w` are both at least 3, after the loop executes, `i` remains 0, `j` becomes equal to `w - 1`. The loop will always execute at least once, printing either '#' if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, or '.' otherwise. If `h` or `w` is less than 3, the loop does not execute and no characters are printed.**
