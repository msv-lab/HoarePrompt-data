According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range specified by `w` is non-empty. In this case, `w` is greater than 0, so the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions are already met for the loop to execute. 
State: **H and W are integers such that 3 <= H <= 300 and 3 <= W <= 300, h is greater than 0, i is 1, j is equal to w - 1, and w is greater than 0**
