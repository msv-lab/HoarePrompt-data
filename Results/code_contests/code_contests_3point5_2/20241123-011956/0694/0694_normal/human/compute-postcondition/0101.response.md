According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `w` is 1 or greater. At the start of the loop, the loop variable `j` will start at 0 and go up to `w-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `w` must be 1 or greater, and `j` is now 0.
State: **`h` is 3 or greater, `w` is 1 or greater, `j` is 0**
