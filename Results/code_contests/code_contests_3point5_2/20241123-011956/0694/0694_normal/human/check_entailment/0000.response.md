Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description. The code is supposed to draw a frame with a height of H cm and a width of W cm using '#' and '.' characters. However, the code has a logic issue in the nested loops where it prints out the characters. The code prints out a new line after each character instead of printing the entire row of characters for the frame. This results in the frame being printed vertically instead of horizontally as required by the problem description. 

For example, when the input is 3 4, the expected output should be:

```
####
#..#
####
```

But the code will produce the following incorrect output:

```
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
```

Therefore, the code does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case.
