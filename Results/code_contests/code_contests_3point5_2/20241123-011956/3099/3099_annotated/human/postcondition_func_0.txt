The function `func` processes query strings based on specific constraints. It accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. If the pattern string `p` does not contain '*', it compares each character of the input string `q` with the pattern string `p`. If a character in `p` is marked as a question mark and does not match the corresponding character in `q`, or if the character in `q` is not in the set of `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed. If `p` contains '*', it splits into `p0` and `p1`, and further comparisons are made with reversed input strings. The function handles cases where the lengths of input strings do not match the pattern length and prints 'NO'. In the end, the function returns the result of processing the query strings according to the specified rules.
