Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles both cases where the pattern contains the "*" character and where it does not. For each query string, it checks if the pattern matches by replacing the "?" characters with good letters and "*" character with any string of bad letters. The program goes through each character of the pattern and the query string to determine if they match, and prints "YES" if they do and "NO" if they don't. The program also considers edge cases such as when the lengths of the pattern and the query string do not match, or when the pattern splits into two parts separated by "*". Overall, the program covers all scenarios mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output.
