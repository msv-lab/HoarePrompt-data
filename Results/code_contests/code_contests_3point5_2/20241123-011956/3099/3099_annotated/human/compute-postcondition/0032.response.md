Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, containing characters "?", and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `_` is 0, `q` is a string entered by the user, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is a Boolean value indicating whether the character at position `i` in `q` is in `good_letters`. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and exits the loop or if statement.***
