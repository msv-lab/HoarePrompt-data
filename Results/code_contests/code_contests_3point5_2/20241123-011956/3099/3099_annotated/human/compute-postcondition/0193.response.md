Postcondition: ***gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", n is the input integer, good_letters is a set containing unique characters from gls, plen is the length of string p, p0 is the substring of p before "*", p1 is the reversed substring of p after "*", p0len is the length of p0 which is greater than 0 and incremented by 1, p1len is the length of p1, q is the input string, qlen is the length of q. In all scenarios where p0[i] == '?' and q[i] is not in good_letters or p0[i] != q[i], 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. The postcondition ensures that the program handles all possible cases where the characters at index i in q are compared with the corresponding characters in p0, updating y0 accordingly while maintaining the initial conditions of the program variables.***
