Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean that reflects whether the character at index `i` in `q` belongs to `good_letters`. If the character does not exist in `good_letters`, `y0` is set to False, the program prints 'NO', and the loop is terminated. The other variables `qr`, `p1len`, `i`, `y1`, `q`, `t`, `p0len`, and `qlen` maintain their initial values. The character at index `i` in `p0` remains '?'.***
