Output State: **`y0` is False, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `y1` remains True, `q` is the input string, `t` is assigned the substring of `q` starting from index `p0len` excluding the last `p1len` characters if `p1len` is greater than 0; otherwise, `t` is the substring of `q` starting from index `p0len`, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, the character at index `i` in `p0` is '?', `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`. The program prints 'NO'**
