Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` in list `p1` is equal to '?', then if the element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in the list `good_letters', 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. If the element at index `i` in list `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `qr', 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False. In all other cases, `y1` remains True.***
