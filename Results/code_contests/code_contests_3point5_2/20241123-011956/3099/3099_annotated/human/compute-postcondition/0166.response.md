Postcondition: ***gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", n is the input integer, good_letters is a set containing unique characters from gls, plen is the length of string p, p0 is the substring of p before "*", p1 is the reversed substring of p after "*", p0len is the length of p0 which is greater than 0, p1len is the length of p1, q is the input string, qlen is the length of q, y0 is a boolean indicating whether the character at index i in q is in good_letters. If q[i] is not in good_letters, the program prints 'NO', sets y0 to False, and breaks the loop. All the mentioned conditions are met and handled appropriately after the execution of the if statement, covering all possible edge cases.***
