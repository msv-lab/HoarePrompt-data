Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1len` is equal to 0, `t` is set to the sublist of `q` from index `p0len`. If `p1len` is not equal to 0, `t` is assigned the sublist of `q` from index `p0len` to the negative index `-p1len`. After the execution of the if statement, if the intersection of the set of elements in `t` and `good_letters` is greater than 0, it prints 'NO' and the program continues. Otherwise, no variables are affected. `y0` is a boolean and `y1` is true***
