Postcondition: ***`p0len` is 0, `y0` reflects the comparison results between `p0` and `q` characters or if the character in `q` is in `good_letters` and is not False, `y1` is either True or False based on the conditions met in the if-else block, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `qr[i] is not in good_letters`. If this condition is true, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', the program checks if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. If this condition is true, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks.***
