Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. The length of string `q`, `qlen`, remains the same. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. The input string `q` remains unchanged. The length of `p`, `plen`, stays greater than 0. The index `i` remains 2. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', it checks if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, then print 'NO', set `y` to False, and break the loop. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?' and not equal to `q[i]`, then print 'NO', set `y` to False, and break the loop. The state of the program ensures that the loop is broken based on the conditions met in the if else block, maintaining the initial values and relationships of the variables.***
