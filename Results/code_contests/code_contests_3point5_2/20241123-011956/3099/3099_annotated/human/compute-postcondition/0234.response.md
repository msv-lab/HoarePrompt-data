Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` could be either True or False, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `good_letters` is not specified, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios where the program can print 'NO' and update the value of `y1` accordingly.***
