According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p1len`. If `i` is less than `p1len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p1[i]` is checked along with other conditions. If the loop needs to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2**
