Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `q` is assigned the input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed to the console, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks.***
