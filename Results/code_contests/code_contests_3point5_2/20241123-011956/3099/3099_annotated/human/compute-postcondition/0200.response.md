Example Answer:
The list `q` is reversed and assigned to `qr`. The value of `y0` being False does not affect the code execution. The value of `y1` being True does not affect the code execution either. Therefore, the Output State is: If y0 is False, the loop continues without any further action; `y1` is True, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`.
Output State: **If y0 is False, the loop continues without any further action; `y1` is True, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`**
