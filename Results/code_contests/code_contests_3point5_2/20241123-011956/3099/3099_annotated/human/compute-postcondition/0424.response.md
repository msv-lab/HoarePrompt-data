Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `qr[i]` is not in good_letters. If true, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', the program checks if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. If true, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop. This covers all possible cases after the execution of the if else block, ensuring the integrity of the variables and their relationships.***
