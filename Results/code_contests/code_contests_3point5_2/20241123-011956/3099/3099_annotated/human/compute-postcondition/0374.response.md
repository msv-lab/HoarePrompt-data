According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `p0len`. At the end of the last iteration, `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, `y0` is True, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. Since the loop will only execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, `y0` is True, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
