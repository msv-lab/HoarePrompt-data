Postcondition: ***If `p0len` is greater than 0 and all conditions within the loop are met, then `y0` will be True after the loop execution. If any condition fails, 'NO' will be printed, `y0` will be set to False, and the loop will break. The loop will not execute if `p0len` is 0 or if `qlen` is not less than `plen - 1`. If `y0` is False, then the loop will break and `y0` will be set to False.***
