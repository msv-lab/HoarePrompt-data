Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`. If the length of `q` is not equal to the length of `p`, the program prints 'NO' and continues. All other cases are not explicitly handled in the given code fragment.***
