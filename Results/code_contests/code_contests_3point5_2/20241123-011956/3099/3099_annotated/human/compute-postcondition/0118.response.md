Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is True, `q` is assigned the input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `p[i]` is not equal to '?'. If the character at position `i` in strings `p` and `q` are not equal, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. The program breaks out of the loop.***
