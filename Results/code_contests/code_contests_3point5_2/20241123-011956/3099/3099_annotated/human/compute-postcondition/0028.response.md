According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, the program variables are in the state where `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `_` is 0, `q` is a string entered by the user, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is True if `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]` for all `i`, and False if there is any mismatch, `i` is 0, and `plen` is equal to the length of string `p`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next index in string `p`.
2. Update `y` based on the comparison of `p[i]` and `q[i]`.
3. Check if the character at index `i` in string `p` is "?", and the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, then set 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False.
4. Check if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then set 'NO' is printed, set `y` to False, and break the loop.

State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `_` is 0, `q` is a string entered by the user, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is updated based on the comparison of `p[i]` and `q[i`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
