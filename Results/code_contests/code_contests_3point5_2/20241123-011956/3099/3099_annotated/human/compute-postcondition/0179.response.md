Output State: **gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", n is the input integer, good_letters is a set containing unique characters from gls, plen is the length of string p, p0 is the substring of p before "*", p1 is the reversed substring of p after "*", p0len is the length of p0 which is greater than 0, p1len is the length of p1, q is the input string, qlen is the length of q, y0 is a boolean indicating whether the character at index i in q is in good_letters, i is less than p0len + 1. The code snippet just prints 'NO', and does not affect the state of any variables.**
