Example Answer: 
`p1len` is assigned the length of `p1`. The value of `p1` depends on the position of the "*" in string `p`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is the input integer, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before "*", `p1` is the reversed substring of `p` after "*", `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is the input integer, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before "*", `p1` is the reversed substring of `p` after "*", `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`**
