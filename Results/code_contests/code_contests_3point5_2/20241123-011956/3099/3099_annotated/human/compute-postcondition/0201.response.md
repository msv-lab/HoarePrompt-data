According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `p1len`. If `p1len` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **If `y0` is False, the loop continues without any further action; `y1` is True, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
