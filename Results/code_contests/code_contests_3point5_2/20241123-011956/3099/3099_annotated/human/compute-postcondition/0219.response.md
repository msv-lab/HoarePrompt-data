Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` could be either True or False, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `good_letters` is not specified, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
