Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, containing characters "?", and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `_` is 0, `q` is a string entered by the user, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is a Boolean value. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', the program checks if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?', the program checks if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop. All other variables retain their initial values. The postcondition covers all edge cases and accurately reflects the state of the program after the if else block.***
