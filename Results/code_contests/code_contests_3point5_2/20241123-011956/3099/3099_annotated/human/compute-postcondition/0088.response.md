Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`. If the character at index `i` in `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In all other cases where the character at index `i` in `q` is in `good_letters`, the program continues with `y` retaining its previous value (either True or False) and `i` being incremented for the next character index.***
