According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by another 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters containing characters "?", "*", `n` is greater than 0, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `i` is incremented by 2, `_` is 0, `q` is a string entered by the user, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is a Boolean value**
