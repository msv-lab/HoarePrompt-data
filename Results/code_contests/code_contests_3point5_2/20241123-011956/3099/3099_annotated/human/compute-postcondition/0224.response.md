Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` could be either True or False, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `good_letters` is not specified, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the output prints 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This covers the scenarios where the comparison between `p1[i]` and `qr[i]` fails or when `qr[i]` is not a good letter.***
