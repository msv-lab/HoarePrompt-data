According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `p0len`. Since `qlen` is less than `plen - 1` is given as the initial state, it does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted so that `p0len` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0.

State: **`qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, `y0` is True, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
