According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of string `p` is equal to the length of string `q`. At the end of the last iteration, characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. The user inputs `q` and its length is stored in `qlen`. `y` can be True or False. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of string `p` must be equal to the length of string `q`.
State: **Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` can be True or False**
