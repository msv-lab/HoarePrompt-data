Postcondition: ***`p0len` is 0, `y0` reflects the comparison results between `p0` and `q` characters or if the character in `q` is in `good_letters` and is not False, `y1` is either True or False based on whether `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`. `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, and the program prints 'NO' and breaks.***
