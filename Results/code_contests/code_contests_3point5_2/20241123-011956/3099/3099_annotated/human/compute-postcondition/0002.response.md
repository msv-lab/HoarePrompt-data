Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. The value of `p` will depend on the input given, which can include lowercase English letters, "?", and "*". Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`**
