Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, if all characters in string `p` that are marked as "?" match the corresponding characters in string `q` that are not in the set of `good_letters`, and all other characters match as well, then `y` remains True. If there is a mismatch at any point, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. The loop continues until the end of string `p` or until a mismatch is found. If the loop does not execute due to an empty string `p`, `y` remains True. After the execution of the if statement, if `y` is True, 'YES' is printed.***
