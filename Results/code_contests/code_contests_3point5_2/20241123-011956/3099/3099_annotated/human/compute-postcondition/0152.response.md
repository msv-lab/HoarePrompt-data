According to the code, the loop can execute n times. Before the loop starts, the variables `n` and `_` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. Since `n` is provided as input, we need to adjust `_` to match the range of `n`. 
State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is the input integer, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before "*", `p1` is the reversed substring of `p` after "*", `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `_` matches the range of `n`**
