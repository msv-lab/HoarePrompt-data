Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean variable. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, `qr`, `p1len`, and `i` are incremented by 1, `y1`, `q`, `t`, `p0len`, and `qlen` remain unchanged, and the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes occur in the variables.***
