Example Answer:
The variable `q` is assigned the value of the user input obtained from `raw_input()`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input.
Output State: **Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input**
