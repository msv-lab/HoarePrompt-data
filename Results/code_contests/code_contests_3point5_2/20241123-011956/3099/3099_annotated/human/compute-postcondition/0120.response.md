According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, you need to adjust `i` to 1.
State: **Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `q` is assigned the input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
