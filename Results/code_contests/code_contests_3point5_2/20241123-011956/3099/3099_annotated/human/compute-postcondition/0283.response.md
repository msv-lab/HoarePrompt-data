Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean variable. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, increments `i` by 1, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, increments `i` by 1, while `qr`, `p1len`, `y1`, `q`, `t`, `p0len`, and `qlen` retain their initial values. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes occur in the variables.***
