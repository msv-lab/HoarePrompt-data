Postcondition: ***gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", n is the input integer, good_letters is a set containing unique characters from gls, plen is the length of string p, p0 is the substring of p before "*", p1 is the reversed substring of p after "*", p0len is the length of p0 which is greater than 0, p1len is the length of p1, q is the input string, qlen is the length of q, y0 is set to True. If the character at index i in p0 is not equal to the character at index i in q, the function prints 'NO', sets y0 to False, and breaks the loop.***
