According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. `qlen` is the length of string `q`. `y` is False if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`. `q` is assigned the input string from the user. `plen` is greater than 0. `i` is 2**
