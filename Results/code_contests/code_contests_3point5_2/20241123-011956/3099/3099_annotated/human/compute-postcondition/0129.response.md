Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. `qlen` is the length of string `q`. `y` is False if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`. `q` is assigned the input string from the user. `plen` is greater than 0. `i` is 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`. If `p[i]` is a question mark and the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed to the console, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p[i]` is not a question mark and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed to the console, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks.***
