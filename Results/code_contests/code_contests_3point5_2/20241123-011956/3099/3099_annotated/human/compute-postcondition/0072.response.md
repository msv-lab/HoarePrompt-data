Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` can be True or False based on the comparison, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `p[i]` is not equal to '?' and the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. In all cases, the loop breaks after this comparison.***
