Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean variable that reflects whether the character at index `i` in `q` belongs to `good_letters`. If the character does not exist in `good_letters`, `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is terminated. If the character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is terminated. All other variables `qr`, `p1len`, `i`, `y1`, `q`, `t`, `p0len`, and `qlen` retain their initial values. In both cases, the character at index `i` in `p0` remains unchanged.***
