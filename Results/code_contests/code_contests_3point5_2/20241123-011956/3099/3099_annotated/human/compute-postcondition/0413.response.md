Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False. Otherwise, `y1` remains True. The list `p1` has elements, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.***
