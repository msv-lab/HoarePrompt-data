Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is True if the `i-th` character in string `q` is in the list of good_letters. If the `i-th` character in string `q` is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, `y` is False, and the loop breaks. `i` is updated accordingly. The state remains consistent with the initial conditions, ensuring the `i-th` character in string `p` is a question mark '?'***
