Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. The length of string `q`, `qlen`, remains the same. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. The input string `q` remains unchanged. The length of `p`, `plen`, stays greater than 0. The index `i` remains 2. If the condition is met, the state remains as described above, and the loop is broken.***
