Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `p1` is equal to '?'. If the element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in the list `good_letters', then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
