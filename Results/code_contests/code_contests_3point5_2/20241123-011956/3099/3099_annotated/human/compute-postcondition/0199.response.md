Example Answer:
`y1` is assigned the value `True`. The loop continues without any further action if `y0` is False. The variables `y0` and other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: *If y0 is False, the loop continues without any further action; `y1` is True.
Output State: **If y0 is False, the loop continues without any further action; `y1` is True**
