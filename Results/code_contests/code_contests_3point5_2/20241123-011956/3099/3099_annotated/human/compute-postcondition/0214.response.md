Postcondition: ***If `y0` is False, the loop continues without any further action. If `y1` is True and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the loop. If `y1` is True and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without any changes. If `y1` is False and `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. In all cases, `y0` remains False, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 0.***
