Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. `qlen` is the length of string `q`. `y` is False if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`. `q` is assigned the input string from the user. `plen` is greater than 0. `i` is 2. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop.***
