Example Answer: 
`plen` is assigned the length of string `p`. The length of a string can be calculated directly, so the value of `plen` is the length of string `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, and `plen` is the length of string `p`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, and `plen` is the length of string `p`**
