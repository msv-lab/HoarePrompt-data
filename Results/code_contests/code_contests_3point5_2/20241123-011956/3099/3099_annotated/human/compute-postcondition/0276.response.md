Example Answer: 
`y0` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `qr`, `p1len`, `i`, `y1`, `q`, `t`, `p0len`, and `qlen` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `qr`, `p1len`, `i` is incremented by 1, `y1`, `q`, `t`, `p0len`, and `qlen` retain their initial values.
Output State: **`y0` is False, `qr`, `p1len`, `i` is incremented by 1, `y1`, `q`, `t`, `p0len`, and `qlen` retain their initial values**
