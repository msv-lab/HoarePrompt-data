Example Answer:
The code simply prints 'NO' and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state is: Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`.
Output State: **Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`**
