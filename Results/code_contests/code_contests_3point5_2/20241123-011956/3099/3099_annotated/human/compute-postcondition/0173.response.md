Postcondition: ***gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", n is the input integer, good_letters is a set containing unique characters from gls, plen is the length of string p, p0 is the substring of p before "*", p1 is the reversed substring of p after "*", p0len is the length of p0 which is greater than 0, p1len is the length of p1, q is the input string, qlen is the length of q, y0 is a boolean indicating whether the character at index i in q is in good_letters. After the execution of the if-else block, the program ensures that if the character at index i in p0 is "?" and not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop is broken. Similarly, if the character at index i in p0 is not equal to the character at index i in q, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop is broken. All possible edge cases are handled, ensuring the correct execution and state of the program.***
