Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` can be True or False based on the comparison, `i` is incremented by 1. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. All other variables retain their initial values.***
