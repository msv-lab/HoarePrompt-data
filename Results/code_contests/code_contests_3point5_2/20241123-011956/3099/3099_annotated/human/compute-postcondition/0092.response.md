Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` becomes False, `i` is incremented for the next character index, and the loop is broken. This covers the case when there is a mismatch in characters at index `i` between `p` and `q`.***
