Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input. The variables `gls`, `p`, `good_letters`, and `plen` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is the input integer, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is the input integer, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`**
