Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. `q` is the user input and `qlen` is the length of string `q`. If the character at index `i` in `q` is not in the set of `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, increments `i` by 1, and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the comparison process between strings `p` and `q` is halted if an invalid character is encountered in `q`.***
