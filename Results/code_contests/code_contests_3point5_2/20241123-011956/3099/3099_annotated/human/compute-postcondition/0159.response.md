Output State: **gls is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, p is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", n is the input integer, good_letters is a set containing unique characters from gls, plen is the length of string p, p0 is the substring of p before "*", p1 is the reversed substring of p after "*", p0len is the length of p0, p1len is the length of p1, _ matches the range of n, q is the input string, qlen is the length of q. If qlen is less than plen - 1, the program prints 'NO' and continues. The program ensures that the length of q is not shorter than the length of p minus 1, covering the edge case where the length of q is equal to or longer than the length of p minus 1, y0 is set to True**
