Postcondition: ***If `y0` is False, the loop continues without any further action. If `y1` is True and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', `y1` becomes False, and the loop breaks. In all other cases, the program continues as is. `y1` may change based on the condition mentioned in the if statement, while other variables remain unchanged.***
