Example Answer:
The set `good_letters` is created by iterating over the characters in `gls`, which is a string of distinct lowercase English letters. The set ensures that each character in `gls` is unique. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`.
Output State: **`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*", `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`**
