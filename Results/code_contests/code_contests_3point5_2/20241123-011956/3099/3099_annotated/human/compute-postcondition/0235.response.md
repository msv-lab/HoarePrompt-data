According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y0` is False, `y1` could be either True or False, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `good_letters` is not specified, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not affected by the loop iteration.
State: **`y0` is False, `y1` could be either True or False, `qr` is the reversed version of `q`, `good_letters` is not specified, `p1len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3**
