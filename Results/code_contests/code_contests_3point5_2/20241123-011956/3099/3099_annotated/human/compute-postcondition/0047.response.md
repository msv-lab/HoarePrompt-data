Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters containing characters "?", "*", `n` is greater than 0, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `i` is incremented by 1, `_` is 0, `q` is a string entered by the user, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is a Boolean value. If the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in the set of `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y` to False, halting the execution. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop.***
