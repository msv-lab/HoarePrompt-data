Postcondition: ***`gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is the input integer, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`. If `p` does not contain "*", for each input string `q` with a length matching `plen`, if any character in `p` marked as a question mark does not match a character in `q` or if the character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed. If `p` contains "*", and the pattern splits into `p0` and `p1`, for each input string `q` with a length at least `plen - 1`, if there are mismatches between `p0` and `q`, mismatches between `p1` and the reversed `q`, characters in the substring `t` that intersect with `good_letters`, or the length of `q` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed. If none of these cases occur, 'YES' is printed.***
