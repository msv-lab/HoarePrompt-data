Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. The user inputs `q` and its length is stored in `qlen`. The variable `y` can be True or False based on the comparison results during the loop execution. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in the set of `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The loop will not execute if the length of string `p` is not equal to the length of string `q`. If `y` is True, 'YES' is printed.***
