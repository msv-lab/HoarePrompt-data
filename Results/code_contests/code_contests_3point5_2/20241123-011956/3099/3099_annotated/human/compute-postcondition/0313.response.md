Postcondition: ***`p0len` is 0, `y0` reflects the comparison results between `p0` and `q` characters or if the character in `q` is in `good_letters` and is not False, `y1` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0. The character at index `i` in `p1` is not a question mark. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then the program prints 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The overall state after the if else block is determined by the conditions of the initial state and the outcome of the if part.***
