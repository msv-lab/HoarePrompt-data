Output State: 

After the loop executes, if the length of each input string `q` matches the length of the pattern string `p`, the loop will compare each character in the strings. If a character in `p` is marked as a question mark and the corresponding character in `q` is not in the set of `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. If any characters in `p` and `q` do not match, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. If all characters match, 'YES' is printed. If the loop does not execute due to an empty pattern string `p`, the initial values are retained. 

Cases where the loop does not execute:
- If the pattern string `p` is empty or contains the character "*", the loop will not execute, and no comparison will be made.
- If the length of each input string `q` does not match the length of string `p`, 'NO' will be printed.

After the loop executes multiple times, the output state will follow the same pattern as described above for each iteration.
