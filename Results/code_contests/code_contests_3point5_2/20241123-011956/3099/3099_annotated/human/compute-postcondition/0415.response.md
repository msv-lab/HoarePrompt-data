According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so that it is not equal to `p1len` in the next iteration.
State: **`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1**
