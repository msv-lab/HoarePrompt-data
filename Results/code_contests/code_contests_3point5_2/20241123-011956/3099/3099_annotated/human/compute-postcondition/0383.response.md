Postcondition: ***`qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, `y0` is either True or False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters` and `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` remains unchanged as True, and the program continues execution without interruption. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is exited.***
