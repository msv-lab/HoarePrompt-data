Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` can be True or False based on the comparison. If the `i-th` character in string `q` is in the list of good_letters, the program proceeds; otherwise, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the `i-th` character in string `p` is a question mark '?' and matches the `i-th` character in string `q`, the loop continues. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False, leading to the loop breaking. The program maintains the initial conditions, ensuring consistency between the states of the variables.***
