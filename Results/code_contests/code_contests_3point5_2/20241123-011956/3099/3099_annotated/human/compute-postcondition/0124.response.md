Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison. `qlen` is the length of string `q`. `y` is False if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`. `q` is assigned the input string from the user. `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. `plen` is greater than 0. `i` is 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`.***
