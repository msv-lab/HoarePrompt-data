Example Answer:
The length of the string `q` is calculated using the `len()` function and assigned to `qlen`. The previous values of `p` and `q` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`.
Output State: **Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `q` is the user input, `qlen` is the length of string `q`**
