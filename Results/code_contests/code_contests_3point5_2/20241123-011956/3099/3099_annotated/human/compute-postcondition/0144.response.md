Postcondition: ***If plen is greater than 0 and there are characters left in both strings p and q for comparison, the loop will iterate through each character at index i in strings p and q. If the character at index i in string p is a question mark and the character at index i in string q is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the character at index i in string p is not a question mark and the characters at index i in strings p and q are not equal, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. This process continues until the loop finishes iterating through all characters or breaks due to the mentioned conditions. If the loop does not run, the initial values of the variables are retained. After comparisons or in the absence of any comparisons, 'YES' is printed.***
