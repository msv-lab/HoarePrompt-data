Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables are in the following state: `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string of lowercase English letters, characters "?", and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `good_letters` is a set containing unique characters from `gls`, `plen` is the length of string `p`, `_` is 0, `q` is a string entered by the user, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is True if `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]` for all `i`, and False if there is any mismatch, `i` is 0, and `plen` is equal to the length of string `p`. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is "?", and the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. This comprehensive postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
