Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `qr` is the reversed list of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then `qr[i]` not being in `good_letters` results in 'NO' being printed, `y1` being set to False, and the loop being broken. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In all other scenarios, the initial values of `y1`, `qr`, `p1len`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
