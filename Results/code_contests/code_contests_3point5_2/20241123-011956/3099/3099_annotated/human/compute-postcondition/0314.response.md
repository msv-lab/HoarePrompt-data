Postcondition: ***`p0len` is 0, `y0` reflects the comparison results between `p0` and `q` characters or if the character in `q` is in `good_letters` and is not False, `y1` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0. If the `i-th` element of `p1` is a question mark and the `i-th` element of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is broken. If the `i-th` element of `p1` is not a question mark and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the program maintains the initial state while handling different cases such as the `i-th` element of `qr` not being in `good_letters or `p1[i]` not being equal to `qr[i]`.***
