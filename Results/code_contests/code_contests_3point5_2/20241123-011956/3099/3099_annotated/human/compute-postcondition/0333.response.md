Postcondition: ***`p0len` is 0, `y0` reflects the comparison results between `p0` and `q` characters or if the character in `q` is in `good_letters` and is not False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks.***
