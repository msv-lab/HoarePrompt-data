Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned as a slice of `q` starting from index `p0len` till the end of the string. Since `p1len` is 0 and no characters mismatch between `p1` and `qr`, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state is: `p1len` is 0, no characters mismatch between `p1` and `qr`, loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial values, `t` is a substring of `q` starting from index `p0len`.
Output State: **`p1len` is 0, no characters mismatch between `p1` and `qr`, loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial values, `t` is a substring of `q` starting from index `p0len`**
