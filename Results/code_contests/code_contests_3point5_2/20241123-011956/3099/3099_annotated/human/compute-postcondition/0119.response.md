Postcondition: ***Characters are left in both strings `p` and `q` for comparison, `qlen` is the length of string `q`, `y` is True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, `q` is assigned the input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is '?', and the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not '?', and the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q` are not equal, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. The program halts after either condition is met.***
