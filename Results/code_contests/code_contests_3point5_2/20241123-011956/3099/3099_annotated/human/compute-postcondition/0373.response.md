Postcondition: ***`qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, `y0` is True, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `p0[i]` is equal to '?', then if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p0[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In all other cases, no action is taken.***
