Output State: **If the length of `p1` is 0, the loop will not execute. If the length of `q` is less than the length of `p` minus 1, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is continued. If there is a mismatch between the characters of `p0` and the corresponding characters in `q` or if a character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is continued. If there is a mismatch between the characters of `p1` and the reversed characters in `q` or if a character in the reversed `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is continued. If there are any characters in the substring `t` that intersect with `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is continued. If none of the conditions for 'NO' are met, 'YES' is printed.**
