Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given query string matches the pattern provided. It handles the case where the pattern contains a "*" character and where it does not. It checks if the lengths of the pattern and query string match, and then iterates through each character to determine if the characters match or if "?" can be replaced with a good lowercase English letter. The program also correctly handles cases where the pattern contains a "?" character. The program outputs "YES" if the query string matches the pattern, and "NO" otherwise. The implementation covers all the requirements specified in the problem description.
