Postcondition: ***`t`, `p1len`, `good_letters`, `y0` are Boolean values. If `p0[i]` is a question mark and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If `p0[i]` is not a question mark and `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In either case, the values of `y1`, `_`, `qlen`, `p0len`, `i+1` remain unchanged.***
