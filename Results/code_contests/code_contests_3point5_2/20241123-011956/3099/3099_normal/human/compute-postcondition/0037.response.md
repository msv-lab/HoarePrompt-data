Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `y` are strings. `plen` is greater than 0 and equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop. All variables remain unchanged except for `y` in this case. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks the loop. This complete postcondition ensures that the program handles all scenarios where the characters at index `i` in strings `p` and `q` do not match the conditions provided, resulting in the appropriate actions being taken.***
