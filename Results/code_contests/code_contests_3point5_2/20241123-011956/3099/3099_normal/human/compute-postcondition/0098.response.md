Postcondition: ***gls, good_letters, p, q are strings. plen is equal to qlen, n is an integer, and y is True. If qlen is not equal to plen, the program outputs 'NO' without modifying any variables. In cases where qlen is equal to plen, the loop checks each character at index i in p and q. If p[i] is '?', it verifies if q[i] is in good_letters. If not, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p[i] is not '?', it compares p[i] and q[i]. If they are not equal, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. After each iteration, i is incremented. If any of the conditions are met, the loop breaks. After the loop execution, if y is True, the program prints 'YES'.***
