According to the code, the loop execution depends on the conditions related to the elements at index `i` in lists `p1` and `qr`. If the loop is to execute one more time, the conditions that lead to the loop being exited or broken must not be met. So the states that need to be adjusted are:
- If the element at index `i` in `p1` is '?', and the element at index `i` in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. To avoid this, we need to ensure that the element at index `i` in `p1` is not '?' or the element at index `i` in `qr` is in `good_letters`.
- If the element at index `i` in `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` in `qr`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. To avoid this, we need to ensure that the elements at index `i` in `p1` and `qr` are equal.

State: **`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0, `p1` is a list.**
