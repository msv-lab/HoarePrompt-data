According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the program state is not provided. So for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **Not enough information provided to adjust the states for the next iteration**
