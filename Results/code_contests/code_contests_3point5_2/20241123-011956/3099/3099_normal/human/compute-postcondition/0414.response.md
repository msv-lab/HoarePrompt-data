Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0, `p1` is a list. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is '?', and the element at index `i` in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. If the element at index `i` in `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` in `qr`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all other cases, `y1` remains True, and the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.***
