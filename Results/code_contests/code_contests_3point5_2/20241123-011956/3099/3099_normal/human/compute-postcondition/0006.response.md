According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 0. However, the initial state provided does not ensure that the loop will execute. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications are needed:
State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
