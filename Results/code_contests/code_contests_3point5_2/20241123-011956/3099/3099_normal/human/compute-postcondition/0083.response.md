Postcondition: ***gls, good_letters, p, q remain as strings with plen equal to qlen. n is an integer. If p[i] is equal to '?', then if q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop or if statement breaks. If p[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. In all cases, i is 1.***
