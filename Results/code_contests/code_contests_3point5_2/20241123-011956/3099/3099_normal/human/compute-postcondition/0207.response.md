Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i` in the list `qr` is not in the list `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed and the loop breaks. In all other cases, `y1` remains True. `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, `p1` is a list with at least one element and the first element of `p1` is equal to '?'.***
