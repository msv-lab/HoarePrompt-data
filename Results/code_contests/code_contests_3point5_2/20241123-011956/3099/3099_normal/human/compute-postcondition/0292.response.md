Postcondition: ***`y1` is True. `q` is assigned the value of raw_input(). If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is broken. The length of `q` (`qlen`) is less than the length of `plen`. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the variables.***
