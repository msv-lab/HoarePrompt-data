Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `t`, `p1len`, `good_letters`, `y0`, `y1`, `_`, `qlen`, `p0len` maintain their initial conditions. If the `i`-th element of `p0` is a question mark and the `i`-th element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and terminates the loop. If the `i`-th element of `p0` is not a question mark and not equal to the `i`-th element of `q`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop. All edge cases, including the boundaries of each condition, are properly handled within this postcondition.***
