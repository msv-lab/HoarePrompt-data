Example Answer:
The variable `p0len` is assigned the length of `p0`. The value of `p0` is not provided, but it can be inferred that `p0len` will be the length of the substring before the '*'. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `p0` contains the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` contains the reversed substring of `p` after the '*', and `p0len` contains the length of `p0`.
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `p0` contains the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` contains the reversed substring of `p` after the '*', `p0len` contains the length of `p0`**
