Output State: **If the loop iterates without encountering any condition where an element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in `good_letters` or an element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` remains True. If such a condition is met, `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed. The loop continues until a condition is met, in which case it breaks.**
