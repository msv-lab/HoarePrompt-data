Postcondition: ***`t`, `p1len`, `good_letters`, `y0`, `y1`, `_`, `qlen`, `p0len`, `i` maintain their initial conditions. If `p0[i]` is a question mark and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is not a question mark and is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop.***
