Output State: **If any element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if any element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed. The loop will continue to iterate until it finds such a condition, in which case it will break. If no such conditions are met, `y1` remains True after the loop executes.**
