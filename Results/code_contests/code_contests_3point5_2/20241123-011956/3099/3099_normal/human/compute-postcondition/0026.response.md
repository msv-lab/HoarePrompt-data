Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings. `plen` is greater than 0 and equal to `qlen`. `n` is an integer. The character at index `i` in `p` is not equal to '?'. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variables `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `plen`, `qlen`, and `n` are unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
