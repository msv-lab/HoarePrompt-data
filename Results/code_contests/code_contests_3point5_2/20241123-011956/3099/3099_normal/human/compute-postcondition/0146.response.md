Output State: **After the loop executes, if the length of the input string `p` is different from the length of the string `q`, 'NO' is printed, and the loop does not execute. If the lengths are the same, the loop compares the characters at each index of `p` and `q`. If a character in `p` is '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. If a character in `p` is not '?' and is not equal to the corresponding character in `q`, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. If all comparisons pass, 'YES' is printed.**
