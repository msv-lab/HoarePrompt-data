Postcondition: ***`gls, good_letters, p, p0, p1, q` are strings, `plen, p0len, p1len, qlen, n, i` are integers. `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`. `y0` is a boolean that is False if the character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, and True otherwise. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y0` to False. If the character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y0` to False. Otherwise, no action is taken. In all cases, after the if statement executes, the state of the program variables is updated accordingly, with the break statement causing an exit from the most internal loop or if statement.***
