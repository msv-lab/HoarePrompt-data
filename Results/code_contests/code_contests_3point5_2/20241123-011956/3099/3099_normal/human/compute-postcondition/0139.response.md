Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `plen`, `qlen`, `n`, `i` remain unchanged. `y` is set to False if either `q[i]` is not in `good_letters` or `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`. In both cases, 'NO' is printed and the loop is broken. `i` is incremented by 1 after the execution of the if else block.***
