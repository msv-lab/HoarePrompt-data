Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0, and `p1` is a list. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. All conditions are covered, considering the edge cases where `i` is at the boundary of `p1len` and `p1len` is greater than 0.***
