Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `y` are strings. `plen` is greater than 0 and equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y` to False, then breaks the loop. All variables remain unchanged except for `y` in this case. This ensures that the program handles the scenario where the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in the `good_letters` set, signaling 'NO' and modifying the boolean value `y` to False, leading to a loop break.***
