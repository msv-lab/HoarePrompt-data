Example Answer: 
`qlen` is assigned the length of string `q`. The value of `q` is taken from user input, so the length of `q` is calculated and assigned to `qlen`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the user input string, `qlen` contains the length of string `q`.
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the user input string, `qlen` contains the length of string `q`**
