Example Answer: 
`y1` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `y1` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged**
