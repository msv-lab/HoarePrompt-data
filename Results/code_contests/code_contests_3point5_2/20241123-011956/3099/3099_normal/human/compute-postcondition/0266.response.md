Postcondition: ***y1 is True, q is assigned the value of raw_input(), qlen is less than plen - 1, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues, y0 is False, p0len is greater than 0, i is 0, p0 is a list with the element at index i being '?'. If q[i] is not in good_letters, then 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. All the initial conditions are maintained, and the program continues with the updated values of y0 and q[i].***
