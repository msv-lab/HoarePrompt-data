Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean variable. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In all other cases, `y1`, `p1[i]`, `qr[i]`, `i`, `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged.***
