Postcondition: ***If the loop does not execute due to p0len being less than or equal to 0, the program continues with y1 remaining True, q retaining its value, qlen being less than plen - 1, and y0 being False. If p0[i] is a '?', and q[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p0[i] is not a '?', and p0[i] is not equal to q[i], 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. After the loop execution, y1 remains True, q retains its assigned value, qlen is less than plen - 1, and y0 is False if any of the conditions mentioned in the loop are met.***
