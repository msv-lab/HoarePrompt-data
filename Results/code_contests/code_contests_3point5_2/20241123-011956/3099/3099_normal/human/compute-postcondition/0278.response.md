Postcondition: ***`y1` is True, `q` is assigned the value of raw_input(), `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed, the loop continues, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is terminated.***
