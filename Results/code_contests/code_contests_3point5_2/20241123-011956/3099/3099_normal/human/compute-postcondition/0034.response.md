Example Answer: 
`y` is assigned the value `False`. Since `y` is a boolean variable, its value is directly set to `False`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is greater than 0 and equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, the program prints 'NO', `y` is False.
Output State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is greater than 0 and equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, the program prints 'NO', `y` is False**
