Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `plen`, `qlen`, `n` remain the same. `y` is True. `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is '?', and the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is '?', and the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without any changes. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`, then 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False.***
