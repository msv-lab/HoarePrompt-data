Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean variable. If the element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The initial values of `i`, `p1len`, and the element at index `i` in list `p1` remain unchanged.***
