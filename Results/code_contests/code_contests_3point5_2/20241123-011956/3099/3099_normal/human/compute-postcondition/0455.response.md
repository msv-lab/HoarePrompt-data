Postcondition: ***`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`. If '*' is not in `p`, the loop checks for the length of input string `p` and compares it with the length of string `q`. If they are not equal, 'NO' is printed. If the characters at each index of `p` and `q` do not match where `p` has '?', or are not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed. If all character comparisons pass, 'YES' is printed. If '*' is in `p`, `p` is split into `p0` and `p1`, and the reverse of `p1` is taken. The loop then compares the lengths of the input string `q` with adjusted lengths, and if they do not match, 'NO' is printed. Similar character comparisons are made for `p0`, `p1`, and `qr` as described. The loop continues only if `p1len` is not 0 and `p0len` is not 0. If the conditions are met, a slice `t` of `q` is taken. If any character in `t` is in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed. If all checks pass, 'YES' is printed.***
