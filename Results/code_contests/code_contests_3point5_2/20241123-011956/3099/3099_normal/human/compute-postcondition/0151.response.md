Example Answer:
The length of `p1` is calculated and assigned to `p1len`. The value of `p1` is the reversed substring of `p` after the '*', so the length of `p1` determines the value of `p1len`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `p0` contains the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` contains the reversed substring of `p` after the '*', `p0len` contains the length of `p0`, and `p1len` contains the length of `p1`.
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `p0` contains the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` contains the reversed substring of `p` after the '*', `p0len` contains the length of `p0`, and `p1len` contains the length of `p1`**
