Postcondition: ***The loop has checked each element of `p0` against the corresponding element of `q`. If a question mark is encountered and the element is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the elements are not equal, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The loop has completed `p0len` iterations. If `qlen` is less than `p0len - 1`, the loop did not execute and no variables were altered.***
