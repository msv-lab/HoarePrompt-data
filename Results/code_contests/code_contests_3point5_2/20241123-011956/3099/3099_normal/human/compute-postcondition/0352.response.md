Postcondition: ***`t` is either None or a slice of `q`. If `p1len` is 0, `t` is assigned the content of `q`. If `p1len` is not 0, `t` is assigned a slice of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the element at the negative index `-p1len`. If the intersection of the set created from `t` and `good_letters` has a length greater than 0, then 'NO' is printed and the program continues. If `y0` and `y1` are true, 'YES' is printed.***
