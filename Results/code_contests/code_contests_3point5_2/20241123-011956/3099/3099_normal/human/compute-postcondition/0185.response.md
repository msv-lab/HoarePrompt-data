Output State: **`gls, good_letters, p, p0, p1, q` are strings, `plen, p0len, p1len, qlen, n, i` are integers, `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is a boolean. If either `q[i]` is not in `good_letters` or `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables. `i` is less than `p0len + 1**
