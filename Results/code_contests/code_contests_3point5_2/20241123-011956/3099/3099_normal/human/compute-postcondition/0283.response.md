Postcondition: ***`y1` is True, `q` is assigned the value of raw_input(), `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop is terminated. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. All other variables retain their initial values stated in the precondition.***
