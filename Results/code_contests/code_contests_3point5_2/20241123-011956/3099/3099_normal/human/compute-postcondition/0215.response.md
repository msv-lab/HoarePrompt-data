According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y1` may have been set to False based on the conditions mentioned in the description. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`y1` is a boolean, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len` is a positive integer, and `p1` is a list with at least one element**
