Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings. `plen` is equal to `qlen` and at least 1. `n` is greater than 1. `y` is False. `qlen` is the length of string `q`. `i` is 0. `p[i]` is not equal to '?'. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`, then 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False.***
