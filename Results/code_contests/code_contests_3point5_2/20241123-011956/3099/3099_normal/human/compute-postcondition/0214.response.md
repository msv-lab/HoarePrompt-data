Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i` in the list `p1` is equal to '?', and the element at the same index in the list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. In all other cases where p1[i] is not equal to qr[i], 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `y1` remains True. `i` is an integer, `p1len` is a positive integer, and `p1` is a list with at least one element.***
