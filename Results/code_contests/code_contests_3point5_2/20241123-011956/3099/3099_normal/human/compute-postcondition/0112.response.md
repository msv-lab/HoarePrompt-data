Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `plen`, `qlen`, `n`, `y`, `i` remain the same. The character at index `i` in string `p` is still '?'. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, then the print statement 'NO' is executed and `y` is set to False. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is in `good_letters`, then the program continues without any changes.***
