Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `y` are strings with `plen` equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. The program handles both cases where the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters` and where `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, ensuring a proper termination of the loop and updating the value of `y` accordingly.***
