Example Answer:
`p1` is reversed using slicing, so the characters in `p1` are now in reverse order. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `p0` contains the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` contains the reversed substring of `p` after the '*'.
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `p0` contains the substring of `p` before the '*', `p1` contains the reversed substring of `p` after the '*'**
