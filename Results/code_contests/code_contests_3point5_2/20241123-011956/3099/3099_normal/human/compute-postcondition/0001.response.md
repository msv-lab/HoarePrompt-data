Example Answer: 
A set `good_letters` is created containing unique characters from the user input string `gls`. The set comprehension iterates over each character in `gls` and adds it to `good_letters`. Since `good_letters` is a set, it will only contain unique characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`.
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`**
