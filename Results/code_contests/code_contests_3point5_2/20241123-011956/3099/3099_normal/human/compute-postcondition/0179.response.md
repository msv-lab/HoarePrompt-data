Example Answer: 
The code simply prints 'NO' and does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **`gls, good_letters, p, p0, p1, q` are strings, `plen, p0len, p1len, qlen, n, i` are integers, `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is a boolean**
