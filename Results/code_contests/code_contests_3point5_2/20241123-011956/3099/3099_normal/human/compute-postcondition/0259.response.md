Example Answer:
The value of y0 is assigned as True. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: y1 is True, q is assigned the value of raw_input(). If qlen is less than plen - 1, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues, y0 is True.
Output State: **y1 is True, q is assigned the value of raw_input(). If qlen is less than plen - 1, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues, y0 is True**
