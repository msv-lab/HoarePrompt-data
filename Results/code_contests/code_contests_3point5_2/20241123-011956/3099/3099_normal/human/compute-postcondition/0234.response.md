Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is incremented by 2, `p1len` is a positive integer, and `p1` is a list with at least one element. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 2, and the loop breaks. In all other cases, no changes occur to the variables.***
