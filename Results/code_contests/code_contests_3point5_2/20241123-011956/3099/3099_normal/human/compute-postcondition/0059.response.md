Output State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` remain as strings. `plen` is equal to `qlen`. `n` is an integer. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the program outputs 'NO' and continues execution without making any changes to the variables. In all other cases where `qlen` is equal to `plen`, the program continues without altering the values of the variables. `y` is True**
