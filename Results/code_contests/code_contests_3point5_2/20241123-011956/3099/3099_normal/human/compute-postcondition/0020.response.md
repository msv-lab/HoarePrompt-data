Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings. `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is equal to `plen`, `n` is an integer. The character at index `i` in string `p` is '?'. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed. `y` is set to False and the loop is broken. All variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
