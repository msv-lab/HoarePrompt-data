Postcondition: ***y1 is a boolean, i is an integer, p1len is a positive integer, p1 is a list with at least one element, t is None. If any element at index i in the list p1 is equal to '?' and the corresponding element in the list qr is not in good_letters, then y1 is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. If any element at index i in the list p1 is not equal to the corresponding element in the list qr, 'NO' is printed, y1 is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if y1 is False, the loop breaks. Otherwise, y1 remains True.***
