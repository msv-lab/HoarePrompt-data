Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables or the program flow. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`t` is either None or a slice of `q`, starting from index `p0len` to the element at the negative index `-p1len`. The intersection of the set created from `t` and `good_letters` has a length greater than 0**
