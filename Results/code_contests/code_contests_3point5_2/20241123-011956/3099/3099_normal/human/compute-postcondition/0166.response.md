Postcondition: ***`gls, good_letters, p, p0, p1, q` are strings, `plen, p0len, p1len, qlen, n` are integers, `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is a boolean. If the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y0` to False. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
