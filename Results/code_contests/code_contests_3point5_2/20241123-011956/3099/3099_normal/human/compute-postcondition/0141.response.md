Output State: **After the loop executes, if there is at least one character in string `p` that is not equal to the corresponding character in string `q` or if there is a character in string `p` that is '?' and the corresponding character in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. Otherwise, `y` remains True.** 

If `plen` is 0 or `p` and `q` are empty strings, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True.
