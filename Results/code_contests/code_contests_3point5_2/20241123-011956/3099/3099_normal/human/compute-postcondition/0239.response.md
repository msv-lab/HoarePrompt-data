Postcondition: ***y1 is a boolean. If any element at index i in the list p1 is equal to '?' and the corresponding element in the list qr is not in good_letters, then y1 is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop breaks. If any element at index i in the list p1 is not equal to the corresponding element in the list qr, 'NO' is printed, y1 is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if p1len is 0, the loop does not execute, and y1 remains True. If y1 is False, the loop breaks. Otherwise, y1 remains True. i is an integer, p1len is a positive integer, and p1 is a list with at least one element.***
