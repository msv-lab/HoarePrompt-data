Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the user input string.
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the user input string**
