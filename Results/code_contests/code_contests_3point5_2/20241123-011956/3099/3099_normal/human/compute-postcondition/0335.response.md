According to the code, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions for breaking the loop were described. If the loop is to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1 since it is incremented in each iteration.
State: **`y1`, `p1[i]`, `qr[i]`, `i` are incremented by 1, `p1len`, `p1`, `qr` remain unchanged**
