Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings. `plen` is equal to `qlen`. `n` is an integer. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is '?', then if the character at index `i` in string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. If the character at index `i` in `p` is not '?', and it is not equal to the character at the same index in `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. All variables retain their values and relationships after the execution of the if else block. If `plen` is not equal to `qlen`, the program prints 'NO' and the loop does not execute. After the if part is executed which prints 'YES', the program retains the state of the variables and their relationships.***
