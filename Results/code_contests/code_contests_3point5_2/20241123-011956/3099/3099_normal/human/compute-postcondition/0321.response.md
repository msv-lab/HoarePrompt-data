Example Answer:
`y1` is assigned the value `False`, and the previous value is unknown. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the variables `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y1` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged**
