Postcondition: ***'gls', 'good_letters', 'p', 'p0', 'p1', 'q' remain strings. 'plen', 'p0len', 'p1len', 'qlen', 'n' remain integers. 'qlen' is still greater than or equal to 'plen - 1'. 'y0' is set to False if either 'q[i]' is not in 'good_letters' or 'p0[i]' is not equal to 'q[i]'. The loop breaks when the conditions are met, and 'i' is less than 'p0len + 1'.***
