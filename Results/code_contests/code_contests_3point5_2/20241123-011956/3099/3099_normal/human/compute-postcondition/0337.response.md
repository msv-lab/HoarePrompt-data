Postcondition: ***Any element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or any element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed. The loop has iterated until it found such a condition, in which case it broke. If no such conditions are met, `y1` remains True after the loop executes.***
