Postcondition: ***`t` is either None or a slice of `q`, `p1len` is either 0 or not 0, `good_letters` is a set, `y0` is False if the ith element of `p0` is not equal to the ith element of `q`, `y1` is boolean, `_` is an integer, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `p0[i]` is not equal to '?' for the given index i. The program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks the loop if the ith element of `p0` is not equal to the ith element of `q`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.***
