Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean variable. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement in this case. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged, and the loop is broken.***
