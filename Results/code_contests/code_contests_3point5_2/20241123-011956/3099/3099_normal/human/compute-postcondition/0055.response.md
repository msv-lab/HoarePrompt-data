Example Answer:
`qlen` is assigned the length of string `q`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, so the output state is: `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, `qlen` is the length of string `q`.
Output State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, `qlen` is the length of string `q`**
