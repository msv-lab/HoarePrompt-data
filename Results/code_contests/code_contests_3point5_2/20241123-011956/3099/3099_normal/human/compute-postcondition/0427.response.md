Example Answer:
The variable `y1` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `i`, `p1len`, and `p1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y1` is False, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0, `p1` is a list.
Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is an integer greater than 0, `p1` is a list**
