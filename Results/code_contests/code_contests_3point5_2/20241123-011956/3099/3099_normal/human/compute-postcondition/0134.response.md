Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `plen`, `qlen`, `n`, `y` remain the same. `i` is incremented by 1. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This covers the scenario when the condition is met. No changes occur if the condition is not met.***
