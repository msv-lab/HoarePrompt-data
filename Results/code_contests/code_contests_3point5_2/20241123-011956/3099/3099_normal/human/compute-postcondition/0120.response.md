According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `plen`. If `i` is less than `plen`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `plen` remains the same. Since the loop needs to execute one more time, the `i` needs to be adjusted to be 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `plen`, `qlen`, `n` remain the same. `y` is True. `i` is 1**
