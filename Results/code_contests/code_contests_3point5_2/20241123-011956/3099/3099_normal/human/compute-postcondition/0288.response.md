Postcondition: ***`y1` is True. `q` is assigned the value of raw_input(). If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The length of `q` (qlen) is less than the length of `plen`. In all cases, the program continues after the if-else block with the specified modifications.***
