Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If qr[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len` is a positive integer, `p1` is a list with at least one element, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
