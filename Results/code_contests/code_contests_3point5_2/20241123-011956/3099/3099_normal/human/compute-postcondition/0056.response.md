Example Answer: 
The code simply prints 'NO' and does not affect the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, `qlen` is the length of string `q`.
Output State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, `qlen` is the length of string `q`**
