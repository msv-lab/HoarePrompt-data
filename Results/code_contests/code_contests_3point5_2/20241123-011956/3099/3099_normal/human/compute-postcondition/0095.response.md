Output State: **If qlen is not equal to plen, the program outputs 'NO' without making any changes to the variables. In all other cases where qlen is equal to plen, the loop checks each character at index i in p and q. If p[i] is '?', it verifies if q[i] is in good_letters. If not, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p[i] is not '?', it compares p[i] and q[i]. If they are not equal, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the loop breaks. After each iteration, i is incremented. If any of the conditions are met, the loop breaks. The final state includes the values of gls, good_letters, p, q as strings, plen equal to qlen, n as an integer, and y as True.**
