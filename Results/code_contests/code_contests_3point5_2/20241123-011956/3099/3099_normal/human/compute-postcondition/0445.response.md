Postcondition: ***`t` is None initially. If `p1len` is equal to 0, then `t` contains a portion of `q` starting from index 0 to the end. Otherwise, `t` is the slice of `q` from index `p0len` to the negative index of `-p1len`. In all cases, `t` is updated based on the conditions of the if-else block.***
