Postcondition: ***If any element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if any element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed. The loop will continue to iterate until it finds such a condition, in which case it will break. If no such conditions are met, `y1` remains True after the loop executes. Therefore, after the if statement executes, `y1` will remain True if all elements in both lists meet the specified conditions, and it will be set to False and 'NO' will be printed if any condition is violated during the iteration.***
