Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes user input. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: gls, good_letters, p, q are strings, plen is equal to qlen, n is greater than 1, and y is True.
Output State: **gls, good_letters, p, q are strings, plen is equal to qlen, n is greater than 1, and y is True**
