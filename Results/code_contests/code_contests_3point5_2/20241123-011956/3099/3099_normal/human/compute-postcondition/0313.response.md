Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` is set to False, `i` remains 0, `p1len` is still greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `p1` is a list with at least one element where the element at index `i` is not equal to '?'. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the values of `y1`, `i`, `p1len`, and `p1`.***
