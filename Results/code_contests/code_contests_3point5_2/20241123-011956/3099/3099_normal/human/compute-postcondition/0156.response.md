Example Answer:
The code simply prints 'NO' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: *gls, good_letters, p, p0, p1, n, q are strings. plen, p0len, p1len, qlen are integers. qlen is less than plen - 1.
Output State: ***gls, good_letters, p, p0, p1, n, q are strings. plen, p0len, p1len, qlen are integers. qlen is less than plen - 1***
