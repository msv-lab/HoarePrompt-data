Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `plen`, `qlen`, `n` remain the same. `y` is a boolean variable that indicates whether the conditions were met. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', then `y` is True if `q[i]` is in `good_letters`. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, `y` becomes False, `i` is set to 1, and the program breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` becomes False, and `i` is set to 1. In all other cases, there are no changes to the variables.***
