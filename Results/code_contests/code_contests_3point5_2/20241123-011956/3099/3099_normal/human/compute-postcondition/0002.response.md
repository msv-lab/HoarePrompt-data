Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input` accepts user input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string.
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string**
