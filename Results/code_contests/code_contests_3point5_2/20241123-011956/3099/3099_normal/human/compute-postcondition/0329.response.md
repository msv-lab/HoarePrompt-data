Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean variable. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False. In this case, `p1[i]` is not equal to '?' or `p1[i]` is equal to '?' and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr` remain unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.***
