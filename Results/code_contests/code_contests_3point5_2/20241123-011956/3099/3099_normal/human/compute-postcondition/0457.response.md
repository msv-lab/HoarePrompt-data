Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input strings and patterns from the user, processes them based on specific conditions, and outputs either 'YES' or 'NO' for each query string based on the comparison with the pattern. If the pattern contains '*', it splits the pattern into two parts, reverses the second part, and compares the query string accordingly. The function handles cases where the length of the query string does not match the pattern, characters do not match, or the pattern includes '?' or '*'. The function does not return any specific value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query string. **
