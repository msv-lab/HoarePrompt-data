Postcondition: ***`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is equal to `qlen`, `n` is greater than 1, `y` is True, `qlen` is the length of string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the program prints 'NO' and the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
