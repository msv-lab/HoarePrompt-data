Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean variable. If the element at index `i` in list `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `p1len`, and the elements at index `i` in list `p1` and `qr` remain unchanged. If neither condition is met, there is no change in the values of `y1`, `i`, `p1len`, `p1`, and `qr`.***
