Example Answer:
`y0` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `y1`, `q`, and `qlen` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `y1` is True, `q` is assigned the value of raw_input(), `qlen` is less than `plen', 'NO' is printed and the loop continues, `y0` is False.
Output State: **`y1` is True, `q` is assigned the value of raw_input(), `qlen` is less than `plen', 'NO' is printed and the loop continues, `y0` is False**
