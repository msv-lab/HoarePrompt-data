Postcondition: ***gls, good_letters, p, q remain as strings. plen is equal to qlen. n is an integer. y is False. i is 0. The character at index i in p is not '?'. If the character at index i in p is not equal to the character at index i in q, then 'NO' is printed and y is set to False. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally without any changes to the variables.***
