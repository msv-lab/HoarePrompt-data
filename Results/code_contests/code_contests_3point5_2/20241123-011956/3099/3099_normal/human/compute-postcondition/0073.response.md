Postcondition: ***gls, good_letters, p, q remain as strings. plen is equal to qlen. n is an integer. y is True. i is 0. If the character at index i in p is '?', the program checks if q[i] is in good_letters. If it is not, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the program breaks. If the character at index i in p is not '?', the program checks if the characters at index i in p and q are equal. If they are not, 'NO' is printed, y is set to False, and the program breaks. In all cases, after the if else block execution, the program variables maintain their initial values, and the relationships between them are consistent.***
