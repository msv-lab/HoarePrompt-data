Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value `False`. No other variables are affected, and the program prints 'NO'. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings. `plen` is greater than 0 and equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, program prints 'NO', `y` is False.
Output State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings. `plen` is greater than 0 and equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, program prints 'NO', `y` is False**
