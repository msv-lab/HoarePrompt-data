According to the code, the loop can execute if `plen` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `qlen` is equal to `plen` ensures that the loop will execute. Since the program continues without altering the values of the variables, the states needing adjustment are `y` is True and `i` is 0.

State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` remain as strings, `plen` is equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer, `y` is True, `i` is 0**
