According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `p1len`. If p1len is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, y1 is True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `p1len` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`y1` is True, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0**
