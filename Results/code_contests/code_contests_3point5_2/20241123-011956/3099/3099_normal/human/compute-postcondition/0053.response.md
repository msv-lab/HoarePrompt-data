According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `plen`, `qlen`, `p`, and `q`. If `plen` is equal to `qlen`, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, and `plen` is equal to `qlen`. This means that the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings. `plen` is equal to `qlen`. `n` is an integer**
