Example Answer:
The length of the string `p` is calculated and stored in the variable `plen`. The previous values of the variables are `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, and `p` contains the user input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, and `plen` contains the length of string `p`.
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, and `plen` contains the length of string `p`**
