Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input. The values of `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q`, `plen`, `qlen`, and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer.
Output State: **`gls`, `good_letters`, `p`, `q` are strings, `plen` is equal to `qlen`, `n` is an integer**
