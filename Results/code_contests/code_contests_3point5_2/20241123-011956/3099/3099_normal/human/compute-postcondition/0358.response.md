Postcondition: ***`t` is either None or a slice of `q`, `p1len` is either 0 or not 0, `good_letters` is a set, `y0` and `y1` are boolean, `_` is an integer, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen` - 1, the program prints 'NO' but does not alter the state of any variables. All variables maintain their initial characteristics as described in the precondition.***
