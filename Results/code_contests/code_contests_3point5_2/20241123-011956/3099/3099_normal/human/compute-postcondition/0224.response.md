Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean, `i` is incremented by 1, `p1len` is a positive integer, and `p1` is a list with at least one element. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if qr[i] is not in good_letters, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program exits the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to qr[i], 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
