Postcondition: ***y1 is True, q is assigned the value of raw_input(), qlen is less than plen - 1, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues, y0 is False, p0len is greater than 0, i is 0. If p0[i] is '?', and q[i] is not in good_letters, then 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. If p0[i] is not '?' and p0[i] is not equal to q[i], then 'NO' is printed, y0 is set to False, and the loop breaks. All initial conditions are maintained, and the program state progresses accordingly after the execution of the if else block.***
