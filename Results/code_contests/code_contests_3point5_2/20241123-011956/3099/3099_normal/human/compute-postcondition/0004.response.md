Example Answer:
The value of `n` is assigned the user input, which is stored in `gls`. Since `gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, and `plen` contains the length of string `p`, the output state is:
Output State: **`gls` contains the user input string, `good_letters` contains unique characters from `gls`, `p` contains the user input string, `plen` contains the length of string `p`**
