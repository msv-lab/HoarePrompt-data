Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code fails to correctly handle cases where the query string length does not match the pattern length when there is a '*'. Additionally, the code does not properly handle cases where the pattern includes '?' or '*'. The output hints align with these observations, indicating that the code is incorrect.
