Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program calculates the maximum integer K by counting the number of `0`s and `1`s in the input string `S` and then taking the maximum of the two counts. This logic correctly identifies the maximum integer K such that all characters of S can be turned into `0` by repeating the given operation. 

For all the given examples, the program produces the correct output. Additionally, the program follows the problem description by considering the count of `0`s and `1`s to determine the maximum integer K. Hence, the program is correct for all potential cases.
