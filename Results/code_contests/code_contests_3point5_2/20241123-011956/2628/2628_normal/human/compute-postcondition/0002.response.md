According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the string `S`. So, for the loop to execute, the string `S` must not be empty. At the start of the loop, `s0` and `s1` are both 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the string `S` must not be empty and `c` is the first character in the string `S`.
State: **`S` is a non-empty string, `s0` is 0, `s1` is 0, `c` is the first character in the string `S`**
