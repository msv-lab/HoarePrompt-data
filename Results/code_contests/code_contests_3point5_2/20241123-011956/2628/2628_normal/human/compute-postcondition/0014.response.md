Example Answer:
`s1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s1` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s0` and `s1` are integers, `S` still has characters left to process, `s1` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`s0` and `s1` are integers, `S` still has characters left to process, `s1` is increased by 1**
