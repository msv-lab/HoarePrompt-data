Example Answer:
If the first character in `S` is not '0', then `s1` is increased by 1. The previous value of `s1` is unknown, so after execution, `s1` will be incremented by 1. The first character `c` is removed from `S`. The value of `s0` remains unaffected. 
Output State: **`s0` remains 0, `s1` is increased by 1, the first character `c` is removed from `S`**
