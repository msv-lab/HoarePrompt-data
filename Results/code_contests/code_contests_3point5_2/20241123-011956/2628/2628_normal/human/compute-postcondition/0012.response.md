According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `S`. If `S` still has characters left, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s0` and `s1` are integers. If the first character in `S` is '0', then `s0` is increased by 1, `s1` remains 0, and the first character is removed from `S`. If the first character in `S` is not '0', then `s1` is increased by 1, `s0` remains 0, and the first character is removed from `S`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the string `S` must still have characters left to process. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s0` and `s1` are integers, `S` still has characters left to process**
