Output State: **`s0` and `s1` are integers representing the count of '0' and '1' characters in the string `S` respectively. `S` is a string with characters left to process. If `S` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `s0` and `s1` remain 0. The program prints the maximum value between `s0` and `s1`.**
