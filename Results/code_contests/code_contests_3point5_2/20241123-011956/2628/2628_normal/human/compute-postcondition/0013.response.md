Example Answer: 
`s0` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s0` is unknown, so after execution, `s0` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s0` is incremented by 1, `s1` is an integer, `S` still has characters left to process.
Output State: **`s0` is incremented by 1, `s1` is an integer, `S` still has characters left to process**
