Example Answer:
`s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` is 0, so after execution, `s1` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a non-empty string, `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, `c` is the first character in the string `S`, and the first character `c` is not equal to '0'.
Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string, `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, `c` is the first character in the string `S`, and the first character `c` is not equal to '0'**
