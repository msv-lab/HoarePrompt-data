Postcondition: ***`s0`, `s1` are integers. If the first character in `S` is '0', then `s0` is increased by 1, `s1` remains 0, and the first character is removed from `S`. If the first character in `S` is not '0', then `s1` is increased by 1, `s0` remains 0, and the first character is removed from `S`.***
