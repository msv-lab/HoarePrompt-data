Functionality: The function `func()` reads an input string `S` from the user and counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' characters in the string. It then prints the maximum count between '0's and '1's. The function does not explicitly return any value. If `S` is an empty string, the counts `s0` and `s1` remain 0 without any output.
