Example Answer: 
Variables `s0` and `s1` are both assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string consisting of only '0' and '1', `s0` is 0, `s1` is 0.
Output State: **S is a string consisting of only '0' and '1', `s0` is 0, `s1` is 0**
