Example Answer:
`s1` is incremented by 1. Since the last character processed was '1', `s0` is 1 and `s1` is 0. After execution, `s1` becomes 1. Therefore, the Output State is: If the last character processed was '1', then `s0` is 1 and `s1` is 1.
Output State: **If the last character processed was '1', then `s0` is 1 and `s1` is 1**
