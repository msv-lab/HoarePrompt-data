According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters in the string `S`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are defined based on the last character processed. If the last character processed was '0', then s0 = 3 and s1 = 1. If the last character processed was '1', then s0 = 2 and s1 = 1. If the last character processed was any other character, then s0 = 2 and s1 = 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted based on the last character processed in the string `S`. If the last character processed was '0', then s0 should be adjusted to 3 and s1 should be adjusted to 1. If the last character processed was '1', then s0 should be adjusted to 2 and s1 should be adjusted to 1. If the last character processed was any other character, then s0 should be adjusted to 2 and s1 should be adjusted to 1.

State: **If the last character processed was '0', then s0 = 3 and s1 = 1. If the last character processed was '1', then s0 = 2 and s1 = 1. If the last character processed was any other character, then s0 = 2 and s1 = 1.**
