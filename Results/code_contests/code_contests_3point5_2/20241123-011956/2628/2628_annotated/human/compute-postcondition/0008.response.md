According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string S. If there are more characters in S, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, S is a non-empty string consisting of only '0' and '1'. If c == '0', then s0 is incremented by 1, resulting in s0 = 1 and s1 = 0. If c != '0', then s1 is incremented by 1, resulting in s0 = 0 and s1 = 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. If the last character processed was '0', then s0 was incremented, so s0 = 1 and s1 = 0. For the next iteration, s0 needs to be reset to 0 and s1 to 1.
2. If the last character processed was '1', then s1 was incremented, so s0 = 0 and s1 = 1. For the next iteration, s0 needs to be incremented and s1 to be reset to 0.

State: **If the last character processed was '0', then s0 = 0 and s1 = 1. If the last character processed was '1', then s0 = 1 and s1 = 0.**
