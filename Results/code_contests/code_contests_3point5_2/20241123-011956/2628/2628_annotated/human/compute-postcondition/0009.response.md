Example Answer:
The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s0` is unknown, but based on the initial state, if the last character processed was '0', then `s0` would be 1 and `s1` would be 0. Therefore, after execution, `s0` becomes 2. The value of `s1` remains the same. 
Output State: **if the last character processed was '0', then s0 = 2 and s1 = 0. If the last character processed was '1', then s0 = 1 and s1 = 0**
