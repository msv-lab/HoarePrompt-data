The function `func` reads a string `S` from the user input and counts the occurrences of '0's and '1's in the string. It then prints the maximum count between '0's and '1's. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If `S` is an empty string, both counts `s0` and `s1` will be 0.
