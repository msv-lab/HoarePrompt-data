The function `func_1` iterates through elements of iterable object `a`, comparing them with the elements of `b` returned by `func_2()`. It increments `j` until it reaches `m` or until an element mismatch is found. If `j` is less than `m`, it prints -1 and returns. It then compares sets `sa` and `sb` containing elements of `a` and `b` respectively. If they are equal, it prints 0 and returns the sets. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the current value of `gl` and appended to the list `gaps`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, it prints -1 and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and handles different cases based on the conditions mentioned.
