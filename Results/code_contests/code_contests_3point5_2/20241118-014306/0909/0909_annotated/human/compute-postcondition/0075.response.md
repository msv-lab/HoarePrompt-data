Example Answer: 
If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the current value of `gl`, otherwise `specialgap` remains unchanged. The value of `gl` is then appended to the list `gaps`. The `debug_print` function is called to print the contents of the `gaps` list. Therefore, the output state is: If `special` is True, `specialgap` is the current value of `gl`; `gl` is appended to the list `gaps`.
Output State: **If `special` is True, `specialgap` is the current value of `gl`; `gl` is appended to the list `gaps`**
