Postcondition: ***`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The loop increments `j` only if `j` is less than `m` and the element at index `j` of `a` is equal to the element at index `j` of `b`. If `j` reaches `m` or if `a[j]` is not equal to `b[j]`, then the loop stops. If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, the loop continues as per the defined conditions.***
