According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is an iterable object, the loop can execute. At the start, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, so for the loop to execute, `a` must be an iterable object. Additionally, the loop depends on the values of `i` and `ax`, which are defined in the loop statement. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly initialized. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is assigned 0, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of `a`.
State: **`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`**
