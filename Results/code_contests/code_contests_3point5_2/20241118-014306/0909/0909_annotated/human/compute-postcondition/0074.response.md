Example Answer:
If `special` is True, `specialgap` will be assigned the current value of `gl`. Otherwise, `specialgap` remains unchanged. The value of `gl` is appended to the list `gaps`. Therefore, the Output State is: If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the current value of `gl`; otherwise, no change. `gl` is appended to the list `gaps`.
Output State: **If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the current value of `gl`; otherwise, no change. `gl` is appended to the list `gaps`**
