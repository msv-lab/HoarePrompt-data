Postcondition: ***`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. This process continues until either `j` reaches `m` or `a[j]` is not equal to `b[j]`.***
