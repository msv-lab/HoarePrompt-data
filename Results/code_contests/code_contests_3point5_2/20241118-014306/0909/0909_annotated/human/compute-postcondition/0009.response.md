According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `j`, and `m`. If `j` is less than `m` and the first element of `a` is equal to the element at index `j` of `b`, then `j` is increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater or equal to 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, the conditions should be met:
1. `j` should be less than `m`
2. The first element of `a` should be equal to the element at index `j` of `b`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater or equal to 0, and the conditions mentioned above are satisfied**.
