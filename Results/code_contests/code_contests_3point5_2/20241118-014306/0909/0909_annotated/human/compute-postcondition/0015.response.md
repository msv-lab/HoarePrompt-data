According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`. If `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be incremented by 1
- If the loop body changes `a`, `b`, or `j`, those changes need to be reflected in the state.

State: **`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`, `i` is one more than the previous value**
