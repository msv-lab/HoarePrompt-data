Postcondition: ***If `special` is True, `specialgap` is the current value of `gl` and `gl` is appended to the list `gaps`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, then the function prints -1 and returns. There are no other changes to the variables `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, or `gaps` after the execution of the if else block.***
