Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is greater or equal to 0, so after execution, `j` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
