According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is such that it is either less than `m` or `j` is assigned a value greater than `m` due to `ax` not being equal to `b[j]`, `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`, `mx` is the maximum value in the set difference of `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the previous value of `gl` if `ax` equals `b[j]` and `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0 if `ax` equals `b[j]` and `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `gl` is 1, `special` is True if the first element of `a` is equal to the maximum value in the set difference of `sa` and `sb`, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `ax` needs to be assigned the next element in `a`.

State: **`a` has at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is such that it is either less than `m` or `j` is assigned a value greater than `m` due to `ax` not being equal to `b[j]`, `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`, `mx` is the maximum value in the set difference of `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the previous value of `gl` if `ax` equals `b[j]` and `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0 if `ax` equals `b[j]` and `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `gl` is 1, `special` is True if the first element of `a` is equal to the maximum value in the set difference of `sa` and `sb`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element of `a`.**
