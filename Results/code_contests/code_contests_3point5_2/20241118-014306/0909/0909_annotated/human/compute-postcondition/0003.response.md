Example Answer:
The function `func_2()` is called and its return value is assigned to variable `b`. The previous value of `a` is unknown. The output state after execution is: `a` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`**
