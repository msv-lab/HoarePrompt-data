According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable object `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start, `j` is 0 and `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, so to execute the loop, `a` must have at least 1 element and `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`. Additionally, since `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False, these values do not affect the loop execution.
State: **`a` has at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is 0, `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`, `mx` is the maximum value in the set difference of sa and sb, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`**
