Postcondition: ***`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, and `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`. If sa is equal to sb, the function prints 0 and returns sa and sb. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
