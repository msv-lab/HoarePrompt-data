Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `x` and the integer division of `g` by `k`, and then adding the product of `y` and the remainder of the division of `g` by `k`. The value of `g` is not the last element in the `gaps` list, so `g` retains its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `k`, and `g`, `g` is not the last element in the `gaps` list.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `k`, and `g`, `g` is not the last element in the `gaps` list**
