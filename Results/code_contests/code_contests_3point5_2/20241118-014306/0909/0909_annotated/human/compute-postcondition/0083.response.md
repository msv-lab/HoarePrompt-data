Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `x` and the integer division of `g` by `k`, and the product of `y` and the remainder of `g` divided by `k`. The initial state provides that `ans` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers, `k` is an integer, and `g` is the first element in the `gaps` list. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `k`, and `g`.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `k`, and `g`**
