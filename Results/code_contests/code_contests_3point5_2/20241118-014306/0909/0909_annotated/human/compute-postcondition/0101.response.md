The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. 

In Case 1, the function iterates through elements of iterable object `a`, comparing them with the elements of `b` returned by `func_2()`. It increments `j` until it reaches `m` or until an element mismatch is found. If `j` is less than `m`, it prints -1 and returns. 

In Case 2, the function compares sets `sa` and `sb` containing elements of `a` and `b` respectively. If they are equal, it prints 0 and returns the sets. 

In Case 3, if `special` is True, the function assigns the current value of `gl` to `specialgap` and appends `gl` to the list `gaps`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, it prints -1 and returns. There are no changes to other variables after the execution of the if-else block. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to handle different cases based on the conditions mentioned above, without accepting any parameters and performing specific operations accordingly.
