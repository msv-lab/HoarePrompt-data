Postcondition: ***`a` has at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is such that it is either less than `m` or `j` is assigned a value greater than `m` due to `ax` not being equal to `b[j]`, `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`, `mx` is the maximum value in the set difference of `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the previous value of `gl` if `ax` equals `b[j]` and `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0 if `ax` equals `b[j]` and `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `gl` is 1, `special` is True if the first element of `a` is equal to the maximum value in the set difference of `sa` and `sb`, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`. After the if else block executes, `special` is True if `ax` is equal to `mx`, otherwise `special` remains the same. In the case where `j < m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, `j` is incremented by 1, specialgap is assigned the value of `gl` if `special` is True, `gaps` appends the value of `gl`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If the else part executes, and `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True. Otherwise, `gl` is incremented by 1. The postcondition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if else block.***
