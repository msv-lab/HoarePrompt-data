Example Answer:
The set `sb` is created from the elements of `b`, which is the return value of `func_2()`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `j`, and `sa` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, and `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`.
Output State: **`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, and `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`**
