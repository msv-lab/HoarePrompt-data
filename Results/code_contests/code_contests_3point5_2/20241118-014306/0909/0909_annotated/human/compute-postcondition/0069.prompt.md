You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *`a` has at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is such that it is either less than `m` or `j` is assigned a value greater than `m` due to `ax` not being equal to `b[j]`, `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`, `mx` is the maximum value in the set difference of `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the previous value of `gl` if `ax` equals `b[j]` and `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0 if `ax` equals `b[j]` and `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `gl` is 1, `special` is True if the first element of `a` is equal to the maximum value in the set difference of `sa` and `sb`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element of `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `specialgap` is set to `gl`. The list `gaps` appends `gl`, `gl` is set to 0, `special` is set to False. Otherwise, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True and `gl` is incremented by 1.
```
for (i, ax) in enumerate(a):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
