Postcondition: ***`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater or equal to 0. If `j` is less than `m` and the first element of `a` is equal to the element at index `j` of `b`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables and the program continues with `j` retaining its value.***
