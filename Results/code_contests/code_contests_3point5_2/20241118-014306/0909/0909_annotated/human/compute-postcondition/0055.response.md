Postcondition: ***`a` has at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is such that it is either less than `m` or `j` is assigned a value greater than `m` due to ax not being equal to b[j], `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`, `mx` is the maximum value in the set difference of sa and sb, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 1, `special` is True, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`. If ax equals b[j] and j is less than m, then j is incremented by 1. If special is True, then specialgap is assigned the value of gl. In all other cases, if ax equals the maximum value in the set difference of sa and sb, special is set to True, otherwise gl is incremented by 1. After the if statement, `special` is True if `ax` is equal to `mx`, otherwise `special` remains the same. No changes are made to the other variables mentioned in the precondition.***
