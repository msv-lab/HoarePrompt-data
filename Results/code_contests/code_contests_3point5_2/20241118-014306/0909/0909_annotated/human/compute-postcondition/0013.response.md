Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `j` and other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`.
Output State: **`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j']**
