According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `a`, `j`, and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. This process continues until either `j` reaches `m` or `a[j]` is not equal to `b[j]`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions should be such that `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are: `j` should be less than `m` and `a[j]` should be equal to `b[j]`. 

State: **`a` is an iterable object, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is less than `m` and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`.**
