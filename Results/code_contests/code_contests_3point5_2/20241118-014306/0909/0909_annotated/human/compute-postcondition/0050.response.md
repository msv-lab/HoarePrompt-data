Postcondition: ***`a` has at least 1 element, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`, `j` is such that it is either less than `m` or `j` is assigned a value greater than `m` due to ax not being equal to b[j], `sa` is a set containing elements of `a`, `sb` is a set containing elements of `b`, `mx` is the maximum value in the set difference of sa and sb, `gaps` is a list containing the previous value of `gl` if ax equals b[j] and j is less than m, otherwise gaps is an empty list, `gl` is 0 if ax equals b[j] and j is less than m, otherwise `gl` is 1, `special` is True if the first element of `a` is equal to the maximum value in the set difference of sa and sb, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`. If ax equals b[j] and j is less than m, then j is incremented by 1. If special is True, then specialgap is assigned the value of gl. In all other cases, if ax equals the maximum value in the set difference of sa and sb, special is set to True, otherwise gl is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `special` is True, then `specialgap` is equal to the value of `gl`. Otherwise, the values of all variables remain the same as described in the precondition.***
