Based on the code provided and the problem description, as well as the output hints, I believe that the program is correct and the correctness is **True**.

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` processes the sequences of warrior powers `a` and `b` based on the given conditions of casting Fireball and Berserk spells. It iterates through the elements of `a` and `b`, checking for matching elements incrementally, handling special cases where the maximum power warrior needs to be considered, and calculating the minimum amount of mana required to transform `a` into `b`.
- The function correctly handles cases where the sequences `a` and `b` are already equal, where no transformation is needed (prints 0), and also handles cases where it is impossible to transform `a` into `b` (prints -1).
- The use of sets `sa` and `sb` ensures that all elements in both sequences are distinct, meeting the specified condition.
- The algorithm correctly computes the mana required based on the cost of Fireball, the range of Fireball, and the cost of Berserk spells.
- The program accounts for edge cases such as when the special case of the maximum power warrior is involved and when the Fireball spell cannot be cast due to insufficient range.

Therefore, based on the code logic and the adherence to the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True** for all potential cases.
