Postcondition: ***`i` is adjusted to the next index in list `a`, and `ax` is updated to the next element in list `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, `gaps` list contains the value of `gl`, `gl` is set to 0, and `special` is set to False. Otherwise, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True. In all cases, `gl` is incremented by 1, reflecting the number of gaps.***
