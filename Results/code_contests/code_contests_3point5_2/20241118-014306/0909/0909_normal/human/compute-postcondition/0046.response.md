Postcondition: ***`j`, `i` are integers, `a` is a non-empty list, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, `m`, `b` are integers, `sb` is a set containing the elements of list `b`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` are integers. If j < m and ax == b[j], then j is increased by 1, specialgap is assigned the value of gl, gaps list contains the value of gl, gl is reset to 0, and special is set to False. If j >= m or ax is not equal to b[j], then if ax == mx, special is set to True, otherwise gl is increased by 1. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if else block, ensuring the correct state of the variables.***
