Output State: **`j`, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, `b` are integers and `sb` is a set containing the elements of list `b`. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the program prints 0 and returns. In all other cases where `sa` is not equal to `sb`, no actions are taken. All variables retain their initial integer values and `sb` remains unchanged with the elements of list `b`.**
