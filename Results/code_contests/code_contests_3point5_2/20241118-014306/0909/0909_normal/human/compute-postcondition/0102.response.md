Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a series of integer variables and a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function may return in three different cases. 
Case 1: It checks if elements in list `a` match elements in list `b` incrementally and prints -1 if the condition is not met. 
Case 2: It compares sets created from lists `a` and `b`, prints 0 if they are equal, and does nothing otherwise.
Case 3: It calculates various values based on the elements in lists `a` and `b`, prints -1 if a specific condition is not met, and computes a final answer `ans` based on certain conditions. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` involves processing the elements of lists `a` and `b` and performing different actions based on their relationship and specific conditions.**
