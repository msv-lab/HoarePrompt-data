Postcondition: ***`i`, `ax`, `j`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap`, `k`, `ans` are integers. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl` and `gaps`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1. If `x < y * k`, `ans` contains the sum of the product of `x` and the integer division of each element in `gaps` by `k`, plus the product of `y` and the remainder of the division of each element in `gaps` by `k`. If `x >= y * k`, `ans` contains the sum of `y * g` for each `g` in the `gaps` list. If `specialgap` is less than `k` in the else part, the program prints -1. If `gaps` is empty in the else part, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains 0.***
