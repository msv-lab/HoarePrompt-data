The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function operates on a series of integer variables and a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function may return in three different cases.

Case 1: After the if statement, `j`, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, `b` are all integers. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1 while the other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to any of the variables. If `j` is never less than `m` or `ax` never matches `b[j]`, the loop will not execute and the initial state will remain the same.

Case 2: `j`, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, `b` are integers and `sb` is a set containing the elements of list `b`. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the program prints 0 and returns. In all other cases where `sa` is not equal to `sb`, no actions are taken. All variables retain their initial integer values and `sb` remains unchanged with the elements of list `b`.

Case 3: `i`, `ax`, `j`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap`, `k` are integers. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. `gaps` contains the value of `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to operate on a series of integer variables and a list of integers, possibly returning in one of the three cases described above.
