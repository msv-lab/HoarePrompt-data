At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, and `b` have specific values. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]` must be satisfied. So, for the next iteration, `j` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is increased by 1, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, `b` remain unchanged**
