Output State: **`i`, `ax`, `j`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap`, `k`, `ans` are integers. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. `gaps` contains the value of `gl`. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. `ans` is `y * g`, and x is greater than or equal to y * k, `gaps` is not empty**
