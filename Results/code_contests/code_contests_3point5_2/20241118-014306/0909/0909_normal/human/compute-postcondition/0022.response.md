Example Answer:
The set `sb` is created by converting the list `b` into a set. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: After the if statement, `j`, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, `b` are all integers, and `sb` is a set containing the elements of list `b`.
Output State: **After the if statement, `j`, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, `b` are all integers, and `sb` is a set containing the elements of list `b`**
