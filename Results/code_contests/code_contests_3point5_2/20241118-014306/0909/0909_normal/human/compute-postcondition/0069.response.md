According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the conditions related to `j`, `ax`, `special`, and the values in the lists `a` and `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been updated to the next index in list `a`, `ax` has been updated to the next element in list `a`, `j` may have been updated based on the condition, `special` may have been updated based on the condition, and `gl` has been incremented by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` needs to be increased by 1.
- If `special` is True, `specialgap` needs to be set to the value of `gl`.
- The `gaps` list needs to append the value of `gl` and then be reset to 0.
- `special` needs to be set to False.
- If `ax` equals `mx`, `special` needs to be set to True.
- Otherwise, `gl` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is updated to the next index in list `a`, `ax` is updated to the next element in list `a`, `j` may be updated based on the condition, `special` may be updated based on the condition, `gl` is incremented by 1. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to the value of `gl`. `gaps` list appends the value of `gl` and is then reset to 0. `special` is set to False. If `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True. Otherwise, `gl` is incremented by 1**
