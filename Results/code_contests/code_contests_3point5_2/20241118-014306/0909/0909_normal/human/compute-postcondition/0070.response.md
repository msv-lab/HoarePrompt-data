Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of the last element of list `a`, `ax` is the last element of list `a`, `j` is an integer, `m`, `b` are integers, `sb` is a set containing the elements of list `b`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` are integers. If j < m and ax == b[j], then j is incremented until it reaches m, specialgap is the last gap value before the condition was met, gaps list contains all the gap values, gl is the gap count between matches, and special is True if there was a special condition. If the loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial values.**
