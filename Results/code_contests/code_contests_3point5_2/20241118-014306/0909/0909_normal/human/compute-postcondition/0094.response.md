Example Answer:
The value of `y * g` is added to `ans`. The previous values of `ans`, `y`, and `g` are known, so the calculation can be performed directly. Therefore, the Output State is: values of all variables remain the same except `ans` which is updated based on the calculation of `y * g`.
Output State: **values of all variables remain the same except `ans` which is updated based on the calculation of `y * g`**
