Postcondition: ***`j`, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, `b` are all integers. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1 while the other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to any of the variables. This ensures that the program state is updated correctly based on the conditions specified in the if statement, handling the scenario where `j` is less than `m` and `ax` matches `b[j]`.***
