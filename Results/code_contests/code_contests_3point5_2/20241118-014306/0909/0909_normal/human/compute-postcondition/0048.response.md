The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` adjusted to the next index in list `a`, and `ax` updated to the next element in list `a`.
Output State: **`i` adjusted to the next index in list `a`, and `ax` updated to the next element in list `a`**
