Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the product of `y` and `g`. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, and the value of `y` and `g` is also unknown. Therefore, the output state will be: values of all variables remain the same except `ans` which is updated based on the calculation of `y * g`, `gaps` list has more elements.
Output State: **values of all variables remain the same except `ans` which is updated based on the calculation of `y * g`, `gaps` list has more elements**
