Postcondition: ***After the if statement, `j`, `i`, `a`, `ax`, `m`, `b` are all integers. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1 while the other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to any of the variables. If `j` is never less than `m` or `ax` never matches `b[j]`, the loop will not execute and the initial state will remain the same.***
