According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `ax`, `b`, `special`, `specialgap`, `gl`, `gaps`, `mx`, and the length of list `a`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is adjusted to the next index in list `a`
- `ax` is updated to the next element in list `a`
- If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1
- If `special` is True, `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, `gaps` list contains the value of `gl`, `gl` is set to 0, and `special` is set to False
- Otherwise, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True
- In all cases, `gl` is incremented by 1, reflecting the number of gaps

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be updated to the next index in list `a`
- `ax` should be updated to the next element in list `a`
- If `j` is still less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` should be increased by 1
- If `special` is True, `specialgap` should be assigned the value of `gl`, `gaps` list should contain the value of `gl`, `gl` should be set to 0, and `special` should be set to False
- If `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` should be set to True
- `gl` should be incremented by 1

State: **`i` is updated to the next index in list `a`, `ax` is updated to the next element in list `a`, `j` may be updated based on the condition, `special` may be updated based on the condition, `gl` is incremented by 1**
