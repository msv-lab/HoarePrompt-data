Postcondition: ***`i`, `ax`, `j`, `m`, `b`, `sb`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap` are integers. If special is True, then j is incremented until it reaches m, specialgap is the last gap value before the condition was met, gaps list contains all the gap values, gl is the gap count between matches, and special is True. If the loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial values***
