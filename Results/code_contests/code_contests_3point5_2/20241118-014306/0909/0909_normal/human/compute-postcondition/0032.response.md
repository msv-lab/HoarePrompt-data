According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `i` will be the index of the element in `a`, and `ax` will be the element itself. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`j` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, `m`, `b` are integers, `sb` is a set containing the elements of list `b`, `gl` is 0, `special` is False**
