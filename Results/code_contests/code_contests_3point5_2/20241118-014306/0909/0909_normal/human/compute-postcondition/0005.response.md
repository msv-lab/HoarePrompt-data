According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `a` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0 and `ax` is the first element in the list `a`.
State: **`j` is 0, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element in the list `a`**
