Example Answer:
`specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. The value of `gl` is incremented by 1, so `specialgap` takes on the incremented value of `gl`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated to the next index in list `a`, `ax` is updated to the next element in list `a`, `j` is incremented by 1, `special` may be updated based on the condition, `gl` is incremented by 1, `specialgap` is updated to the new value of `gl`.
Output State: **`i` is updated to the next index in list `a`, `ax` is updated to the next element in list `a`, `j` is incremented by 1, `special` may be updated based on the condition, `gl` is incremented by 1, `specialgap` is updated to the new value of `gl`**
