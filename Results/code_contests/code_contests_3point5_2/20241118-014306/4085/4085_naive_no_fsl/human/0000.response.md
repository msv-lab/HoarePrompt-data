Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program is only checking if the total lengths of the blocks in the two messages are equal, but it is not correctly determining the maximum number of files that could be in the archive. The program is not handling the splitting of files into blocks and checking if the files can be rearranged to form the same archive. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
