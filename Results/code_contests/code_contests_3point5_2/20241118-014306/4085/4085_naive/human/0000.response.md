Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program reads the input, calculates the total length of blocks in each message, and then iterates through the blocks to determine the maximum number of files the intercepted archive could consist of. The program correctly handles the scenario where the total lengths of the messages are equal and calculates the maximum number of files accordingly. The logic of comparing the block lengths and incrementing the file count is implemented correctly, ensuring that the output is the maximum number of files. Additionally, the program maintains two pointers to iterate through the blocks of the messages and correctly updates the total length of blocks as it progresses. Overall, the program follows the problem description for every potential case, making it correct.
