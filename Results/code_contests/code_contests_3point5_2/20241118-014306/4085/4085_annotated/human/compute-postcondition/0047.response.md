Postcondition: ***`s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2` are integers. If `s1` < `s2`, `p1`, `s1`, `f`, and `p2` are increased by 1. `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, `p2` is increased by 1 and `s2` is updated by adding the integer value of `q3[p2]`. The if condition checks if `s1` is equal to `s2`, if true, `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are increased by 1. After the execution of the if else block, all variables retain their initial conditions and update values as per the given conditions, covering all edge cases including the cases where `s1` is less than `s2`, `s1` is equal to `s2`, and `s1` is greater than `s2`.***
