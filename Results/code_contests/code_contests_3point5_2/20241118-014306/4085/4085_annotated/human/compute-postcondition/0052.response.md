Output State: **If the loop executes at least once: `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2` are integers. If `s1` > `s2`, `p2` is incremented by 1, `s2` is updated to the sum of `s2` and the integer value of `q3[p2]`. If `s1` == `s2`, `s1` is set to 0, `s2` is set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1. If `s1` < `s2`, `p1` is incremented by 1, `s1` is updated to the sum of `s1` and the integer value of `q2[p1]`. If the loop doesn't execute: `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2` remain as their initial values.**
