Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user and processes it according to certain conditions within a loop. It initializes variables and updates them based on comparisons. If the loop executes, it updates the variables `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2` accordingly. At the end, it prints the value of variable `f`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
