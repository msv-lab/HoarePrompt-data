Example Answer:
`q3` is assigned the value of the input split by spaces using `raw_input().split()`. The previous value of `q2` is the input split by spaces. Therefore, the Output State is: `q2` is the input split by spaces, `q3` is the input split by spaces.
Output State: **`q2` is the input split by spaces, `q3` is the input split by spaces**
