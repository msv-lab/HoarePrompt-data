Postcondition: ***`s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2 + 1`, `a1`, `a2` are integers. If `s1` > `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated to the sum of `s2` and the integer value of `q3[p2]`. If `s1` == `s2`, then `s1` is set to 0, `s2` is set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1. If `s1` < `s2`, then `s1` is assigned the value of `s1` plus the integer value of `q2[p1]`.***
