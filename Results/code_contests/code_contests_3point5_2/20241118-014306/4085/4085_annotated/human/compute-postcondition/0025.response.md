According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p1` and `p2` as long as they are less than `a1` and `a2` respectively. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions need to be met for the loop to execute again:
1. If `s1` > `s2`, then `p2` needs to be incremented by 1 and `s2` needs to be updated to the sum of `s2` and the integer value of `q3[p2]`.
2. If `s1` == `s2`, then `s1` needs to be set to 0, `s2` needs to be set to 0, `f` needs to be incremented by 1, `p1` needs to be incremented by 1, and `p2` needs to be incremented by 1.
3. If `s1` < `s2`, then `s1` needs to be assigned the value of `s1` plus the integer value of `q2[p1]`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2 + 1`, `a1`, `a2` are integers.**
