Postcondition: ***`s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2` are integers. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` is set to 0, `s2` is set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `s1` is assigned the value of `s1` plus the integer value of `q2[p1]`. All the variables maintain their relationships and increments as described in the precondition.***
