Example Answer:
The value at index 0 of the list `q2` is converted to an integer and assigned to `s1`. The initial states of `q2` and `q3` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is an integer, `q2` is the input split by spaces, `q3` is the input split by spaces.
Output State: **`s1` is an integer, `q2` is the input split by spaces, `q3` is the input split by spaces**
