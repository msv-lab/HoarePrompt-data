Output State: 
If `s1` < `s2`, `p1`, `s1`, `f`, and `p2` are increased by 1. `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0. `p2` is increased by 1. After executing `s2 = s2 + int(q3[p2])`, the new value of `s2` is calculated by adding the integer value of `q3[p2]` to the previous value of `s2`.
Output State: **Updated values based on the conditions and calculations mentioned above**
