Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program is only checking if the total lengths of the two messages are equal and then incrementing a counter `f` without correctly determining the maximum number of files the intercepted archive could consist of.

The program does not handle the splitting of files into blocks and doesn't consider the order of files while determining the maximum number of files in the archive. It simply compares the total lengths of the two messages and increments a counter, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
