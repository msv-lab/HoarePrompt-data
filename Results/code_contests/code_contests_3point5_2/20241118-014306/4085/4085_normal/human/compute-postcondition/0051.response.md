According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p1`, `a1`, `p2`, and `a2`. If both `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `p1` and `p2` need to be adjusted. 

State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1+3`, `p2+2`, `a1`, `a2` are positive integers. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then after the execution of the program fragment, `s1` is set to 0, `s2` is set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 2, and `p2` is increased by 1. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, there is no change in the values of the variables. Otherwise, if `s1` is less than `s2`, there is no change in the values of the variables.**
