Example Answer:
q3 is assigned the input split as a list, so q3 now contains the input split values. The variables n, m, xi, yi, q1, and q2 remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105. xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 106. The sum of xi's is equal to the sum of yi's. The sum of xi's is less than or equal to 106. q1 is assigned the input split as a list; q2 is assigned the input split as a list; q3 is assigned the input split as a list.**
