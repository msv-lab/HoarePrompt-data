Example Answer:
s1 is assigned the integer value of the first element of list q2. The value of q2[0] is unknown, so s1 takes the value of the first element of q2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105. xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 106. The sum of xi's is equal to the sum of yi's. The sum of xi's is less than or equal to 106. q1 is assigned the input split as a list; q2 is assigned the input split as a list; q3 is assigned the input split as a list; s1 is an integer value based on the first element of q2.
