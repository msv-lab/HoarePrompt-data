Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2` are positive integers. If `s1 < s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated to the previous value of `s1` plus the integer value at index `p1` of list `q2`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are set to 0. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
