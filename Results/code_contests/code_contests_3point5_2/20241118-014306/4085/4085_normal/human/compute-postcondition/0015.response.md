Example Answer:
`p2` is assigned the value `p2 + 1`. The previous value of `p2` is unknown, so after execution, `p2` will be incremented by 1. All other variables remain the same except for `s2`, which is now 0. `f` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except for `s2`, which is now 0; `f` is incremented by 1; `p2` is incremented by 1**
