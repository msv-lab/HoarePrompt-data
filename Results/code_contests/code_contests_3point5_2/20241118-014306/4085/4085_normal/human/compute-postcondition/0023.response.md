Example Answer:
The value of `s2` is updated by adding the integer value of `q3[p2]` to it. The previous values of `s2`, `q3`, and `p2` are unknown, so the output state is: `s2` is updated by adding an integer value from `q3[p2]`.
Output State: **`s2` is updated by adding an integer value from `q3[p2]`**
