Example Answer: 
`p1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p1` is unknown. The other variables remain the same except for `s2`, which is now 0. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except for `s2`, which is now 0; `f` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except for `s2`, which is now 0; `f` is incremented by 1**
