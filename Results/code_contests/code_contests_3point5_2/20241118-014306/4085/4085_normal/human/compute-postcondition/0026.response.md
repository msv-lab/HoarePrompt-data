Example Answer:
`s1` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2` are positive integers with the same values as before, except `s1` which is now 0.
Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1` is 0, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2` are positive integers**
