Example Answer:
If s1 is equal to s2, then s1 and s2 are set to 0, f is incremented by 1, p1 is incremented by 1, and p2 is incremented by 1. If none of the conditions are met, all variables retain their original values. The output state is: f is incremented by 1.
Output State: **f is incremented by 1**
