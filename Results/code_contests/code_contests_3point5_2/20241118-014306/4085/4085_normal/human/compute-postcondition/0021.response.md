Postcondition: ***n, m, xi, yi, q1, q2, q3, s1, s2, f, p1, p2, a1, a2 are positive integers. If s1 is greater than s2, then s1 and s2 are set to 0, f is incremented by 1, p1 is incremented by 1, and p2 is incremented by 1. If s1 is less than s2, p1 is updated to p1 + 1 and s1 is updated to s1 + int(q2[p1]). In all other cases, all variables retain their original values.***
