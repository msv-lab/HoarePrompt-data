Example Answer: 
The value of `s2` is updated by adding the integer value of `q3[p2]` to it. Since there is no information about the initial values of `s2`, `q3`, and `p2`, we cannot determine the exact result. Therefore, the output state is: No change in the values of the variables.
Output State: **No change in the values of the variables**
