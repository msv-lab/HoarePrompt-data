Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2` are positive integers. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are set to 0. `f`, `p1`, `p2` are incremented by 1. `a1` and `a2` remain positive integers. `s1` is updated to the previous value of `s1` plus the integer value at index `p1` of list `q2`.**
