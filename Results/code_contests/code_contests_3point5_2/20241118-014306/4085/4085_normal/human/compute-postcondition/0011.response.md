Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105. xi and yi are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 106. The sum of xi's is equal to the sum of yi's. The sum of xi's is less than or equal to 106. q1 is assigned the input split as a list; q2 is assigned the input split as a list; q3 is assigned the input split as a list; s1 is an integer value based on the first element of q2; s2 is an integer value based on the first element of q3; f is 0, p1 is 0; p2 is 0; a1 is an integer value based on the first element of q1; a2 is an integer value based on the second element of q1. Additionally, s1 is equal to s2.**
