According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p1` and `p2`. If `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, all variables are positive integers. If `s1 < s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0. If `s1 > s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `p1 < a1`, then `p1` needs to be incremented by 1.
- If `p2 < a2`, then `p2` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1+1`, `p2+1`, `a1`, `a2` are positive integers.**
