Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1+1`, `p2+1`, `a1`, `a2` are positive integers. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then after the execution of the program fragment, `s1` is set to 0, `s2` is set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is increased by 1, and `p2` is increased by 1. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
