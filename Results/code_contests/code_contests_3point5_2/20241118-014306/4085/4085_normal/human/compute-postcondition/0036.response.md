Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `f`, `a1`, `a2` remain the same. If `s1 < s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1, `s1` is updated to the previous value of `s1` plus the integer value at index `p1` of list `q2`. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are set to 0. Otherwise, no changes occur. `p2` is increased by 1.**
