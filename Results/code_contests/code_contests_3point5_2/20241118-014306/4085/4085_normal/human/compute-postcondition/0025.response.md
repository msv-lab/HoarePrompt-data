According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p1` and `p2`, which need to be less than `a1` and `a2` respectively. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states of the variables are as follows:
- `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2` are positive integers.
- If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1.
- If `s1` < `s2`, `p1` is updated to `p1 + 1` and `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`.
- If `s1` > `s2`, `p2` is updated to `p2 + 1` and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`, then no adjustments are needed.
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `xi`, `yi`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2` are positive integers.**
