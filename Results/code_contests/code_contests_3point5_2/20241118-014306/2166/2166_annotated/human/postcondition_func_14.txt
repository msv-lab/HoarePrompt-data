The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs a series of calculations within a loop, updating the value of `res` based on conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `p`. After the loop execution, the function returns the final updated value of `res`. The function does not handle cases where `y` is 0 or negative, potentially leading to unexpected results in those scenarios.
