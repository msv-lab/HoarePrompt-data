Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue lies in the function `func_19`, where the reordering of ice spheres is incorrect. The logic provided in the program does not guarantee that Sage will be able to buy the maximum number of cheap ice spheres.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Expected Output:
2
3 1 4 2 5

Actual Output (Program's Output):
0
5 4 3 2 1

In this example, the program fails to reorder the ice spheres in a way that maximizes the number of cheap ice spheres Sage can buy. Sage should be able to buy 2 ice spheres, but the program's output does not reflect this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
