The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if `n` is a prime number. It covers various cases:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False.
- If `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3, the function returns True.
- If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns False.
- For `n` greater than 3, the function iterates to check primality using a loop. If `n` is a prime number, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
- Additionally, the function does not account for negative integers or non-integer inputs.
