The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y` without any remainder, the function returns the integer result of `x` divided by `y`. Otherwise, if `x` is not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of `x` divided by `y`, rounded down to the nearest integer, plus 1. The function correctly handles both cases where `x` is divisible and not divisible by `y`.
