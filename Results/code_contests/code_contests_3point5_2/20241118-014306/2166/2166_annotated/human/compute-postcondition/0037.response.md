Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is positive, list `a` has at least 3 elements, and in list `b`, the element at index `i` is smaller than both the element at index `i - 1` and the element at index `i + 1`, and `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is positive, list `a` has at least 3 elements, in list `b`, the element at index `i` is smaller than both the element at index `i - 1` and the element at index `i + 1`, and `ans` is increased by 1**
