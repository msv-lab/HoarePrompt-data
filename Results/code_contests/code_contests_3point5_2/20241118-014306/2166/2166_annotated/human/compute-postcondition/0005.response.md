Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is ' ', so a space is written to the file. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value ' ', `file` is assigned sys.stdout unless specified in kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ', `file` is assigned sys.stdout unless specified in kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`**
