Example Answer: 
The `flush()` method is called on the file object, but since the 'flush' key has been removed from kwargs or is set to False, the flush operation does not occur. Therefore, no changes happen to the initial state. 
Output State: **`at_start` is True, kwargs is a dictionary with 'flush' key removed or set to False**
