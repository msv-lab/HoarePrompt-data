Functionality: **The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and writes the elements of `args` to the standard output separated by 'sep'. If `args` is empty, no elements are written. The function then writes the value of 'end' from the `kwargs` dictionary to the standard output followed by a newline character. If the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs` and set to True, the standard output is flushed. However, the function does not return the integer value 20 as indicated in the annotations.**
