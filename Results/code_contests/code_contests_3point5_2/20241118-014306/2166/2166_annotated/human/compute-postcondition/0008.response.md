Example Answer: 
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `at_start` could have been either True or False. Since it is now explicitly set to False, the output state is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout unless specified in kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout unless specified in kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`**
