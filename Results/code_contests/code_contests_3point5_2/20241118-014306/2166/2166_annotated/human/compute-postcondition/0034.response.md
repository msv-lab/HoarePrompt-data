Output State: **If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. If n is positive, the loop appends values from list a to list b based on the value of f. If f is 0, the loop appends the value of a[j] to b and decreases j by 1. If f is 1, the loop appends the value of a[i] to b and increases i by 1. The variable f toggles between 0 and 1 after each iteration. The values of i, j, n, and k remain unchanged after the loop executes.**
