Postcondition: ***`n` is positive, list `a` has at least 3 elements. If in list `b`, the element at index `i` is smaller than both the element at index `i - 1` and the element at index `i + 1`, then `ans` is increased by 1. The program handles all edge cases such as the first and last elements of the list where there is no previous or next element to compare, ensuring correct execution for each scenario.***
