Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is positive, list `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is a value within the range of 1 to `n - 2`, and `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is positive, list `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is a value within the range of 1 to `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1**
