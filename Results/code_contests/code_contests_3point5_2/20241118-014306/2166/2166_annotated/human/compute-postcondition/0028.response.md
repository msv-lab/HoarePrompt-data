Output State: `i`, `j`, `n`, `k`, `b` are integers. If the initial value of `f` was 0, `b` contains the value of `a[i]` and `i` is increased by 1. If the initial value of `f` was 1, `b` contains the value of `a[j-1]` and `j` is decreased by 1. `f` is toggled between 0 and 1 after each execution. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
