Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `sep` is assigned the value ' ', `file` is assigned sys.stdout unless specified in kwargs, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ', `file` is assigned sys.stdout unless specified in kwargs, `at_start` is True**
