According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, list `a` has at least 3 elements, and `i` is the next value within the range of 1 to `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, list `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the next value within the range of 1 to `n - 2 + 1`**
