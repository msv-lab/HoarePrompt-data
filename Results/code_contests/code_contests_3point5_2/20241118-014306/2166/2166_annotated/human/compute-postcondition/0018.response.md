Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Since there is no change in the initial state, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout unless specified in kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, and the string representation of `x` is written to `file`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout unless specified in kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, and the string representation of `x` is written to `file`**
