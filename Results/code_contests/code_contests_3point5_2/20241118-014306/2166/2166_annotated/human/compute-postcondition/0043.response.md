Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, list `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the next value within the range of 1 to `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, list `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the next value within the range of 1 to `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1**
