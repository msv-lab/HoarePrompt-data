The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It iteratively updates `x` and `y` based on a swapping and modulo operation until `y` becomes 0. The function then returns the final value of `x`, which represents the price of the ice sphere. The functionality of the function is to determine the price of the ice sphere after processing the input parameters `x` and `y`.
