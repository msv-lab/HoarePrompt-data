The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It uses a while loop to calculate the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. After the loop executes, the function returns the final value of `x`, which will be a positive integer if `y` is not 0, or the initial value of `x` if `y` is 0. The functionality of the function is to compute the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and return the final value of `x`.
