The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n`, representing the number of ice spheres in the shop. It then follows a series of checks based on the value of `n`:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns True.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns False.
4. After executing a loop, if `n` is not divisible by any `i` or `i + 2` up to the square root of `n`, the function returns True.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns True.
Therefore, the function determines specific conditions based on the input `n` and returns either True or False accordingly.
