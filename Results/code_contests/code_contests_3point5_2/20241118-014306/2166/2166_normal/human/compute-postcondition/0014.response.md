According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` list. If there are more elements in the `args` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, and `x` is the next element in `args`. This implies that there are more elements left in the `args` list for the loop to continue. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`at_start` is False, `x` is the next element in `args`, there are more elements in `args`**
