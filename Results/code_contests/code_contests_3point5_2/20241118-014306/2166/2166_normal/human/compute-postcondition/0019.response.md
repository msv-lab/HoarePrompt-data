According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `args` and the value of `at_start`. If there are more elements in `args` and `at_start` is False, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `x` is the next element in `args`, and there are more elements in `args`. To execute the loop one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in `args`, and there must still be more elements in `args`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`at_start` is False, `x` is the next element in `args`, there are still more elements in `args`**
