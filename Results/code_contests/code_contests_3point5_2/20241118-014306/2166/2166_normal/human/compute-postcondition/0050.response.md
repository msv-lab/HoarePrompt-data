Functionality: ** The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over elements in list `a` in alternating order, then checks if each element in `b` is smaller than its adjacent elements. If so, it increments the `ans` variable. It then calls two functions `func_20` with different arguments, one being `ans` and the other being all elements of list `b`. The function does not return any value. **
