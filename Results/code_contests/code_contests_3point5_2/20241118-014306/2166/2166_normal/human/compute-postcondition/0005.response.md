Example Answer: 
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the value of `sep`. The previous values of the variables are `at_start` is False, and `x` is the first element in `args`. The `write` method affects the file contents but does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `x` is the first element in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `x` is the first element in `args`**
