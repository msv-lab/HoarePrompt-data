Example Answer: 
The `flush()` method is called on the `file` object. Since no other information is provided about the `file` object or its initial state, we can assume that calling `flush()` does not change the value of `at_start` and the presence of the 'flush' key in kwargs. Therefore, the output state is: `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`at_start` is False**
