Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file. If `at_start` is True, it will write the string representation of the first element in `args` to the file. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file. Since `at_start` is True, the string representation of `x` is written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is True, `x` is the first element in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is True, `x` is the first element in `args`**
