Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the file. The variables `at_start` and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `x` is the next element in `args`, there are more elements in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `x` is the next element in `args`, there are more elements in `args`**
