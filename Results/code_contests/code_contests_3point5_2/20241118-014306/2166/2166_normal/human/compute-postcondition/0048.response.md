Output State: If the conditions are met as described, the function `func_20` is called with the argument `*b`. This will trigger the specified behavior inside the function, potentially modifying the variables according to the function's implementation. The output state will depend on the changes made within the function `func_20` and how it interacts with the initial state variables.
