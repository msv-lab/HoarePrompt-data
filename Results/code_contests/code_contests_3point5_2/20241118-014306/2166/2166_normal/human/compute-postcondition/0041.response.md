Postcondition: ***If n is greater than 1, b contains elements from a in alternating order, i is 2, j is adjusted, f toggles between 0 and 1, k is incremented by 1 until k is equal to n. If b[i] is less than both b[i-1] and b[i+1], then ans is incremented by 1. This condition holds true after the execution of the if statement.***
