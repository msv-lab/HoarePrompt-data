Postcondition: ***If n is greater than 1 and b contains elements from a in alternating order, i is 3, j is adjusted, f toggles between 0 and 1, k is incremented by 1 until k is equal to n, then after the if statement executes and if b[i] is less than both b[i-1] and b[i+1], ans is incremented by 1.***
