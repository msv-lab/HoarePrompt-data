According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `args`. If there are more elements left in `args`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `x` is the first element in `args`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next element in `args` will become the new `x`.
State: **`at_start` is False, `x` is the next element in `args`**
