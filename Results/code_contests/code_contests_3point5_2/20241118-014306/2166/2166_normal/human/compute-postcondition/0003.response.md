According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the `args` list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `at_start` being True does not guarantee the loop execution, it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can run. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the adjusted state should be `at_start` is True, and `x` is the first element in the `args` list.
State: **`at_start` is True, `x` is the first element in `args`**
