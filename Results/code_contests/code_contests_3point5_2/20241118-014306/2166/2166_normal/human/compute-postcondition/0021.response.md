Example Answer:
The `end` keyword argument is popped from `kwargs` and written to the file. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True. If `args` has more than one element, `sep` is written to the file to separate elements, and `x` is the last element in `args`. After execution, `at_start` remains False. 
Output State: **`at_start` is False**
