Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers generated by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `i` and `j` are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `b` is updated with an element from either `a[j]` or `a[i]` depending on the value of `f`, `f` alternates between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by 1, k is less than `n+1. If f == 0, `b` contains an additional element appended from `a[j-1]`, `j` is decremented by 1, `f` is toggled between 1 and 0. If f != 0, `b` contains an additional element appended from `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `f` is toggled between 0 and 1.***
