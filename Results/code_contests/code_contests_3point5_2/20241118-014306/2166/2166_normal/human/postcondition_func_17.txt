The function func_18 sets the standard input and output to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. It does not accept any parameters. The annotations mention constraints related to positive integers n and prices of ice spheres a_i, but the code itself does not utilize these parameters or constraints. Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is solely to redirect standard input and output to specific files.
