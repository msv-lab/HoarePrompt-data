The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It then returns the integer division result of `x` by `y` if the division results in an integer. If the division does not result in an integer, the function returns the quotient of `x` divided by `y`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, plus 1. The functionality covers cases where `y` is 0, where the division by `y` results in a fractional number, and where negative values are involved.
