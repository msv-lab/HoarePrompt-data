The function func_10 accepts a positive integer x and returns 0 if x is not zero and if x is a power of 2. However, the function will not behave as expected for all cases as the annotation suggests. In reality, the function returns 0 only when x is a power of 2. Missing functionality: The function does not cover the case when x is zero.
