Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program is attempting to reorder the ice spheres in a specific way to maximize the number of cheap ice spheres Sage can buy. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_19` is incorrect.

The program is sorting the ice spheres in a way that alternates between taking the ice sphere with the highest price and the lowest price. This approach does not guarantee that the ice spheres will be cheap as required by the problem description. The program needs to reorder the ice spheres in a way that ensures the maximum number of cheap ice spheres can be bought.

Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
