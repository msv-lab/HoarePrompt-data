Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input, where the first line is the length of the encoded word and the second line is the encoded word itself.
2. The program correctly decodes the encoded word by following the process described in the problem statement.
3. The program handles both even and odd length encoded words by considering the position of the median letter.
4. The program outputs the decoded word as expected. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
