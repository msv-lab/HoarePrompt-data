Output State: **If `n` is positive, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string. If `n` is odd, `i` is set to 0. If `n` is even, `i` is set to 1. If `i` is less than 0, the loop does not execute. In either case, `i` is decremented by 2 after each iteration and `ns` gets appended with the character at index `i`.**
