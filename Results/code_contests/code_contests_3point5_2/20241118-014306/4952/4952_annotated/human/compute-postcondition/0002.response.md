Example Answer:
`ns` is assigned an empty string. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` is an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` is an empty string**
