Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value of `n - 2`, where `n` is a positive integer. The value of `i` depends on the value of `n` provided as an input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` is an empty string, and `i` is calculated based on the input value of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` is an empty string, and `i` is calculated based on the input value of `n`**
