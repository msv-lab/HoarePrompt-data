Example Answer:
The character at index `i` in the list `s` is appended to the list `ns`. The value of `i` can be -2 or greater, and the value of `s` is obtained from the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i`, and `i` is greater than or equal to -2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i`, and `i` is greater than or equal to -2**
