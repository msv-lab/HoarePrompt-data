Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the input value, which is a string. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, it can be assumed that the input will be a valid integer. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.**
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.**
