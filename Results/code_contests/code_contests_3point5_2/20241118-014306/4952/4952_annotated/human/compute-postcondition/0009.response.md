According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to -4. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i-2`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
