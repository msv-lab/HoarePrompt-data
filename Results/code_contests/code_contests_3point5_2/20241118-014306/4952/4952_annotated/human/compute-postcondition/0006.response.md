According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decremented by 2 based on the input value of `n`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to -2.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i`, and `i` is greater than or equal to -2**
