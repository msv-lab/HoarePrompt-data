Example Answer: 
The character at index `i-2` in the list `s` is appended to the variable `ns`. The previous values of `ns` and `s` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i-2` appended.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i-2` appended**
