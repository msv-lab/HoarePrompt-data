Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 2, the previous value of `i` is unknown, and the value of `i` is calculated based on the input value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i`, and `i` is calculated based on the input value of `n` where `i` is decremented by 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i`, and `i` is calculated based on the input value of `n` where `i` is decremented by 2**
