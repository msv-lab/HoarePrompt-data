Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i-2` appended.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `ns` contains the character at index `i-2` appended**
