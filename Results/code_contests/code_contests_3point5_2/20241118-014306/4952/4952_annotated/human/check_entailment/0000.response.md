Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input, which consists of the length of the encoded word and the encoding itself.
2. It then decodes the encoding as described in the problem statement by selecting characters at specific indices and appending them to a new string.
3. The program handles both even and odd length encoded words by adjusting the starting index accordingly.
4. The final decoded word is printed as the output.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
