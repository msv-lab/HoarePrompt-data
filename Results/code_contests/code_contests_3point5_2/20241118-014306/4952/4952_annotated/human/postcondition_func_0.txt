The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, then reads a string `s` of characters. It constructs a new string `ns` by appending characters from `s` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is odd, it starts appending characters from the second-to-last index of `s` with a step of 2, and then continues with a step of 2 from the first index. If `n` is even, it starts appending characters from the last index of `s` with a step of 2, and then continues with a step of 2 from the second index. The final constructed string `ns` is printed as the output. The function operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. The function does not explicitly return any value.
