Example Answer:
`ns` is concatenated with the character at index `i` from list `s`, where `i` is 4 and `n` is an integer. The value of `ns` can be the character at index `n-4` from list `s` along with the character at index `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 4, `ns` is either the character at index `n-4` from list `s` concatenated with the character at index 4 from list `s` or an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 4, `ns` is either the character at index `n-4` from list `s` concatenated with the character at index 4 from list `s` or an empty string**
