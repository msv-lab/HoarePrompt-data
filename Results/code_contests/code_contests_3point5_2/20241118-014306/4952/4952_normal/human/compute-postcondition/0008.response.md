Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`**
