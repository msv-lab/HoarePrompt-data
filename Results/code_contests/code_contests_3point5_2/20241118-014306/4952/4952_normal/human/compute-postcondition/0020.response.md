Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 2, so `i` changes from -2 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `ns` is either the character at index n-4 from list s or an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `ns` is either the character at index n-4 from list s or an empty string**
