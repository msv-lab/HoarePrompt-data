Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is assigned as 1. After the loop finishes, `i` will be -2. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `If n is at least 4, then ns includes the character at index n-4 from list s. If n is 3 or less, ns remains an empty string.` `i` will be -2 after the loop finishes.
Output State: **If n is at least 4, then ns includes the character at index n-4 from list s. If n is 3 or less, ns remains an empty string. `i` will be -2 after the loop finishes**
