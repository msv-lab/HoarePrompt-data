According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 6. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 7. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 7, `ns` is either the character at index `n-4` from list `s` concatenated with the character at index 4 from list `s` or an empty string**
