Example Answer: 
The value of `ns` is updated by appending the character at index `i` from the list `s`. The value of `ns` depends on the value of `n` and `i`, which is 1. If `n` is such that `n-4` is within the bounds of `s`, then `ns` will have the character at that index, otherwise it will be an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `ns` is either the character at index n-4 from list s or an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `ns` is either the character at index n-4 from list s or an empty string**
