According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, and `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`, `i` is greater than 0**
