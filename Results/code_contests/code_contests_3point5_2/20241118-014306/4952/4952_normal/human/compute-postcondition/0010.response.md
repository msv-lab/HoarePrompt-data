Example Answer:
The value of `ns` is updated by adding the character at index `i` from list `s`. `ns` originally consisted of the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by another character. After this operation, `ns` will include the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`. The length of `ns` will increase by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`**
