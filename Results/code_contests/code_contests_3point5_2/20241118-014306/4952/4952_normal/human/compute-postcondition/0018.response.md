Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer. If n is divisible by 2, `i` is set to 0; otherwise, `i` is set to 1. If n >= 4, `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list s. If n is 3 or less, `ns` remains an empty string. After the execution of the if-else block, `i` will be either 0 or 1, and `ns` will be either the character at index n-4 from list s or an empty string. Additionally, `i` will be -2 regardless of the path taken.***
