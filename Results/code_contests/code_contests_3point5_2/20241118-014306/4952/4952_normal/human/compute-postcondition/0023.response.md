Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `ns` is either the character at index n-4 from list s or an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `ns` is either the character at index n-4 from list s or an empty string**
