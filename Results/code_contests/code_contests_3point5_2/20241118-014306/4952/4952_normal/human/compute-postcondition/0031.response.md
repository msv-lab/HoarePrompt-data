Functionality: **The function reads an integer n as input, then reads a string s. It constructs a new string ns by concatenating characters from s at specific indices based on the value of n. If n is at least 4, it includes the character at index n-4 from list s in ns. Then, depending on whether n is divisible by 2 or not, it appends characters at alternate indices starting from 0 or 1 up to n-2 from list s to ns. Finally, it prints the resulting string ns. The function aims to construct a new string by selecting characters from the input string s at specific indices based on the value of n.**
