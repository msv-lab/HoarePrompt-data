Example Answer:
`ns` is appended with the character at index `i` from list `s`, where `i` is greater than 0. The value of `ns` changes based on the value of `i` and the characters in list `s`. The length of `ns` increases by 1 after appending the character. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, `ns` includes the character at index n-4 from list `s` followed by the character at index `i` from list `s`**
