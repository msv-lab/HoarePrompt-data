According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 4, `ns` is either the character at index n-4 from list s or an empty string**
