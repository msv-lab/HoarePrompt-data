Example Answer:
The value of `i` is assigned the value of `n - 2`, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, `i` will be `n - 2`. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, ns is an empty string, i is n - 2**
