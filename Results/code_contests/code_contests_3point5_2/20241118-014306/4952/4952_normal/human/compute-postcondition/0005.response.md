Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but since it is a positive integer, after decrementing by 2, it remains a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, ns includes the character at index n - 4 from list s.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a list of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, ns includes the character at index n - 4 from list s**
