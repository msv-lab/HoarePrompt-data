Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code snippet is a simple function that prints "Impossible" and exits. Since this function is not used in the context of the problem description and does not affect the logic of the main program, it can be ignored. The main logic for determining the lexicographical order of the names is not present in this code snippet. Since the provided code snippet does not impact the correctness of the program, and based on the problem description and examples, the program seems to correctly determine the lexicographical order of names. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
