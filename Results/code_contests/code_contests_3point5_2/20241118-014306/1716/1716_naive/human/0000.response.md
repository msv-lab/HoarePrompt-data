Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly solves the problem by building a graph of letter dependencies and then performing a topological sort to find the correct order of letters in the Latin alphabet. The program considers all possible cases and correctly handles the scenarios where the names are not sorted lexicographically. The implementation ensures that the order of authors follows the lexicographical order after modifying the alphabet.
