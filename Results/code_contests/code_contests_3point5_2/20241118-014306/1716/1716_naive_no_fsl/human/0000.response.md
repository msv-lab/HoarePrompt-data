Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines if there exists an order of letters in the Latin alphabet such that the given names are sorted lexicographically. It checks for the lexicographical order based on the input names and constructs the order of letters accordingly. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program outputs the correct order of letters if it exists, otherwise, it prints "Impossible". The code handles the comparison of names and builds the order of letters accordingly, ensuring that the names are sorted lexicographically.
