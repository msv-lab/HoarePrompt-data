Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. A specific case where the code fails is when there is a circular dependency between two characters. For example, if 'a' depends on 'b' and 'b' depends on 'a', the code will not be able to determine the correct order of characters and will not output a valid permutation of characters. This is a case where the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Additionally, the output hints suggest that the function `func_1` is used to print 'Impossible' and exit the program, but the code actually defines `func_1` after it is called, which could lead to a NameError during execution. This discrepancy between the output hints and the code also indicates that the code does not fully adhere to the problem description.
