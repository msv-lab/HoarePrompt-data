Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the deque object `t`. If `si` is equal to 'T', then `t` will contain the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, and `t` will also contain the appended value of `i`. If `si` is not equal to 'T', then `t` will contain the appended value 'i' for the next iteration. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Number of iterations completed is less than 't' + 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string. If `si` is equal to 'T', `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, `t` also contains the appended value of `i`. Otherwise, if `si` is not equal to 'T', `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, `m` is a deque object containing the value of `i`.
Output State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't' + 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string. If `si` is equal to 'T', `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, `t` also contains the appended value of `i`. Otherwise, if `si` is not equal to 'T', `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, `m` is a deque object containing the value of `i`**
