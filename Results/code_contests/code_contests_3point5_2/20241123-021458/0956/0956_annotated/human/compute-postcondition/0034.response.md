According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were present:

- `t` is not empty
- `arr` has the next element of `t` dequeued and assigned to index `i`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- The comparison result is stored in `poss`
- Length of `t` is greater than 4
- `poss` is updated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the previous value of `poss` and the new comparison result

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `t` should still be greater than 4, and `i` should be less than half the length of `t` with the updated value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is not empty, `arr` has the next element of `t` dequeued and assigned to index `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, the comparison result is stored in `poss`, length of `t` is greater than 4, `poss` is updated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the previous value of `poss` and the new comparison result, `i` is less than half the length of `t`**
