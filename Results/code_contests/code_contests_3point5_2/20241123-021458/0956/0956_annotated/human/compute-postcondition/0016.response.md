Postcondition: ***`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to `file`. In all other cases where `at_start` is True or any other variable differs from the precondition, no action is taken.***
