According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half the number of 'T' characters in the string `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` at index 0 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `arr` at index 1 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `arr` at index 2 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `i` is 3, and `poss` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` at index 0 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `arr` at index 1 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `arr` at index 2 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `i` is 4, and `poss` is False**
