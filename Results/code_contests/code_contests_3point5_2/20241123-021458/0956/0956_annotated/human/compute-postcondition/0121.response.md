According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` at index 0 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `arr` at index 1 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` at index 0 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `arr` at index 1 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `i` is 2**
