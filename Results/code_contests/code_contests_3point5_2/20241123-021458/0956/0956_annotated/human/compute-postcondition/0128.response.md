According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `arr` list. If the list is not empty, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is not empty and each value is updated with popped values from `m`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be modified is `i`, which should be increased by 1 as another iteration is completed.
State: **`t` has at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is not empty and each value is updated with popped values from `m`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed + 1**
