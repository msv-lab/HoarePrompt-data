Example Answer:
The next character `i` is appended to the list `t`, which means `t` will now include the next character. The other variables remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string with more characters to iterate over, `t` now includes the next character, `n` is updated accordingly, and the balance of 'T' and non-'T' characters in `poss` is modified based on the next character.
Output State: **`s` is the input string with more characters to iterate over, `t` now includes the next character, `n` is updated accordingly, and the balance of 'T' and non-'T' characters in `poss` is modified based on the next character.**
