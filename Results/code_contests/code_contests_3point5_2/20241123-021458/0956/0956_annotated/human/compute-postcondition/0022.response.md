Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False if `args` has at least one element, `x` is the last element in `args`. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute and `at_start` remains True. `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` is executed. If `kwargs` has 'flush' key, it is popped and its value is True***
