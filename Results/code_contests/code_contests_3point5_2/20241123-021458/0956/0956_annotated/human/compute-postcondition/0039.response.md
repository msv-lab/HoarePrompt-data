Output State: If `t` is not empty, `arr` contains more elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices, `poss` is updated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current value of `poss` and the result of comparing `i` with the dequeued value from `t`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `t` is empty, `arr` is an empty list, `poss` is True, `i` is incremented by 1.
