According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `arr` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is not empty, there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`, `s` will still not be empty, `t` will contain at least 1 index of 'T' character, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` will be the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` will be a list with values at indices replaced by the indices popped from `m`, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the `arr` list must still have elements to iterate over with the `i` variable pointing to the next element in the list.
State: **`s` is not empty, there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`, `s` will still not be empty, `t` will contain at least 1 index of 'T' character, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` will be the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` will still have elements to iterate over, `i` is pointing to the next element in the list**
