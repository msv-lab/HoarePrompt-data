Example Answer:
The function `func_2` outputs 'YES' if `poss` is True, and 'NO' if `poss` is False. The state of the variables `t`, `m`, `s`, `arr`, and `i` are not affected by the function call. Therefore, the Output State is based on the previous values of the variables.
Output State: **Based on the previous values of the variables, 'YES' or 'NO' will be output**
