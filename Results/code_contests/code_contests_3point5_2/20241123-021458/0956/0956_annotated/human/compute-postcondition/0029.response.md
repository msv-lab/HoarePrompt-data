Output State: **If `t` is not empty, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the number of indices in `t`, `i` is 1, the comparison result is stored in `poss`, length of `t` is greater than 4, and `poss` is updated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the previous value of `poss` and the result of the comparison between the first element of `t` and the element at index 0 of list `m`.**
