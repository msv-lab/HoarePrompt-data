According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the number of iterations completed is less than 't'. At the end of the last iteration, the number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string. If `si` is equal to 'T', `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' and `m` is an empty deque object. Otherwise, if `si` is not equal to 'T', `t` and `m` are empty deque objects, `m` contains the value of `i` that was appended. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- The number of iterations completed should be less than 't' + 1, since the loop will execute one more time.
- `n` remains the length of string `s`.
- If `si` is equal to 'T', `t` will have the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, and `m` will remain an empty deque object.
- If `si` is not equal to 'T', `t` and `m` will be empty deque objects, and `m` will contain the value of `i` that was appended for the next iteration.

State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't' + 1, `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string. If `si` is equal to 'T', `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' for the next iteration and `m` is an empty deque object. Otherwise, if `si` is not equal to 'T', `t` and `m` are empty deque objects, `m` contains the value of `i` that was appended for the next iteration.**
