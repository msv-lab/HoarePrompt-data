According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `arr` list. If there are more elements in `t` to dequeue and assign to `arr`, the loop executes again. If `t` is empty, the loop does not execute. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- If `t` is not empty, `arr` contains more elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices.
- `poss` is updated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current value of `poss` and the result of comparing `i` with the dequeued value from `t`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `t` is not empty, more elements need to be dequeued and assigned to `arr`.
- `poss` needs to be updated according to the conditions mentioned.
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **If `t` is not empty, `arr` contains more elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices, `poss` is updated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current value of `poss` and the result of comparing `i` with the dequeued value from `t`, `i` is incremented by 1**
