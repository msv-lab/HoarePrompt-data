Output State: Number of iterations completed is less than 't' + 1, `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string. If `si` is equal to 'T', `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, `t` also contains the appended value of `i`. Otherwise, if `si` is not equal to 'T', `t` and `m` are empty deque objects, `m` contains the value of `i` that was appended for the next iteration.
