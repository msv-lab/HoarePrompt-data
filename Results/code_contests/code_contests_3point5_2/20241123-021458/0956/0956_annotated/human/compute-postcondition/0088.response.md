Output State: **If there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`, the loop will iterate over the elements in `arr`. After the loop executes, `s` will still not be empty, `t` will contain at least 1 index of 'T' character, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` will be the length of string `s`, `poss` will be False, `arr` will still have elements to iterate over, `i` will be pointing to the next element in the list. If there are no 'T' characters in `t`, the loop will not execute and the values of the variables will remain the same as in the initial state.**
