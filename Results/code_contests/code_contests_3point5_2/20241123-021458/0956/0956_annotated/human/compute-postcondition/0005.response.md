Example Answer: 
The code writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The value of `sep` is ' ', so a space is written to the standard output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`**
