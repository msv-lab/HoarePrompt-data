Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `m`. The previous state of `m` is not provided, so the output state is: `s` is the input string with more characters to iterate over, `t` and `m` are updated to include the next character, `n` is updated accordingly, and the balance of 'T' and non-'T' characters in `poss` is modified based on the next character.
Output State: **`s` is the input string with more characters to iterate over, `t` and `m` are updated to include the next character, `n` is updated accordingly, and the balance of 'T' and non-'T' characters in `poss` is modified based on the next character**
