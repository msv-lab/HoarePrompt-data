Example Answer:
The variable `m` is assigned an empty deque object. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `t` is an empty deque object, `m` is an empty deque object.
Output State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `t` is an empty deque object, `m` is an empty deque object**
