According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop will execute. If `t` is not empty, `arr` should contain elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices, and `poss` should be the result of bitwise AND operations between comparisons of elements in `t` and `m`. `i` should represent the number of iterations completed.

If `t` is empty, the loop won't execute, and `arr` should remain an empty list, `poss` should remain True, and `i` should be 0.

State: **If `t` is not empty, `arr` contains elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices, `poss` is the result of bitwise AND operations between comparisons of elements in `t` and `m`, `i` is the number of iterations completed. If `t` is empty, `arr` is an empty list, `poss` is True, `i` is 0**
