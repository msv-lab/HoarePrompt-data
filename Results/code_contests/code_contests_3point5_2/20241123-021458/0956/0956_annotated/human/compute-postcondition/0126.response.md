According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions for the loop to execute are that the length of `t` is at least 2, the length of `m` is not 0, and `arr` is not empty. After the loop executes, `t` should contain at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` should contain the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` should be the length of string `s`, `poss` should be False, `arr` should be a list with each value updated with the popped values from `m`, and `i` should be equal to the number of iterations completed.

State: **`t` has at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is not empty and each value is updated with popped values from `m`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed**
