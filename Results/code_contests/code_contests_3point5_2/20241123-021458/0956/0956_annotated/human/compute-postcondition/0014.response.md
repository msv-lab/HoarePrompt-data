According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `args` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be the third element in `args`.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`**
