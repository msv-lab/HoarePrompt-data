According to the code, the loop will execute 't' times. At the end of the previous iteration, the number of iterations completed is not given but it is known that the loop has been executed at least once. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, the state must be adjusted so that the number of iterations completed is less than 't'. 
State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't'**
