Example Answer:
The element `(i, si)` is appended to the list `t`. The list `t` now includes the next character of the input string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `s` is not empty, `t` includes the next character, `m` is updated to include the next character, `n` is the updated length of string `s`, `poss` is updated based on the balance of 'T' and non-'T' characters after adding the next character to `t` or `m`, `(i, si)` is the next element of the string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `s` is not empty, `t` includes the next character, `m` is updated to include the next character, `n` is the updated length of string `s`, `poss` is updated based on the balance of 'T' and non-'T' characters after adding the next character to `t` or `m`, `(i, si)` is the next element of the string `s`**
