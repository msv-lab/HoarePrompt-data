According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `t` has at least 1 character containing 'T'. Before the loop starts, the conditions for the loop to execute are as follows:
1. `s` is not empty.
2. `t` contains at least 1 index of 'T' character.
3. `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters.
4. `n` is the length of string `s`.
5. `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters.
6. `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half the length of `t`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 1 index of 'T' character, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is True, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half the length of `t`, and `i` is 0**
