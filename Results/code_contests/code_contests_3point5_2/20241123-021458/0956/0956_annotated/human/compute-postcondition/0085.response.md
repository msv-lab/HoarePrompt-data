According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `arr` list and the condition of `poss`. If `poss` is False and `i` is less than the index of the first 'T' character in `t`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `s` is not empty
- There are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`
- `s` will still not be empty
- `t` will contain at least 1 index of 'T' character
- `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one
- `n` will be the length of string `s`
- `poss` is False
- `arr` will still have elements to iterate over
- `i` is pointing to the next element in the list
- `poss` will be False if `i` is greater than or equal to the index of the first 'T' character in `t`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `poss` should be False
- `i` should be less than the index of the first 'T' character in `t`

State: **`s` is not empty, there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`, `s` will still not be empty, `t` will contain at least 1 index of 'T' character, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` will be the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` will still have elements to iterate over, `i` is pointing to the next element in the list, and `poss` will be False if `i` is less than the index of the first 'T' character in `t`**
