According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. The loop will iterate over the elements in `arr` only if there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
Before the execution of the program fragment: `s` is the input string, if `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise.
After the loop executes: `s` is still not empty, `t` contains at least 1 index of 'T' character, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` still has elements to iterate over, and `i` is pointing to the next element in the list.

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
1. If there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t` and the loop will continue, then `t` should contain at least 2 indices of 'T' characters.
2. If there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t` and the loop will continue, then `poss` should be True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters.
3. If there are no 'T' characters in `t` and the loop will not execute, then the values of the variables will remain the same as in the initial state.

State: **Before the execution of the program fragment: `s` is the input string, if `s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise.**
