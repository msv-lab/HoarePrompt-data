According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the number of elements in `t` divided by 2 is greater than the current value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' character, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the value at index `i` replaced by the index popped from `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr[i]` is updated with the value popped from `m` using `m.popleft()`. To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. The condition `len(t) // 2 > i` needs to be satisfied. So, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. Since `arr[i]` is updated with the value popped from `m`, the value at index `i` in `arr` needs to be updated with the next value popped from `m`.

State: **`s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' character, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the value at index `i` replaced by the index popped from `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr[i]` is updated with the next value popped from `m` using `m.popleft()`**
