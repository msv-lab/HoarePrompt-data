Postcondition: ***`t` contains the indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of 'M' characters, or both are empty if no such characters exist. If `s` is empty, both `t` and `m` will be empty, and `poss` will be True if the number of indices in `m` is half of the number of indices in `t`, otherwise `poss` will be False. If `poss` is True, `arr` will contain elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices, `poss` will result from bitwise AND operations between comparisons of elements in `t` and `m`, and `i` will represent the number of iterations completed. If `t` is empty, `arr` remains empty, `poss` remains True, and `i` is 0.***
