Output State: **If `t` is not empty, after the loop executes, `arr` will contain elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices, `poss` will be the result of bitwise AND operations between the comparisons of elements in `t` and `m`, `i` will be the number of iterations completed. If `t` is empty, the loop won't execute, and `arr` remains an empty list, `poss` remains True, `i` is 0.**
