Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `s` is not empty, `t` contains the index `i` if si is 'T', `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters including the newly appended index `i`, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise, `(i, si)` is the first element of the string `s`. If si is 'T', the index `i` is added to the deque `t`, otherwise, the index `i` is added to the list `m`. This logic covers all possible scenarios and accurately represents the state of the variables after the if-else block execution.***
