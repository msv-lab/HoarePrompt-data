According to the code, the loop can execute if there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`s` is not empty, there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`, `s` will still not be empty, `t` will contain at least 1 index of 'T' character, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` will be the length of string `s`, `poss` will be False, `arr` will be a list with values at indices replaced by the indices popped from `m`, and `i` will be incremented by 1**
