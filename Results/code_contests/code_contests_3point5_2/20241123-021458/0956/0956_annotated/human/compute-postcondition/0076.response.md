According to the code, the loop will execute based on the length of the `t` variable. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 3 indices of 'T' character. So for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `t` should be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 3 indices of 'T' character, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the value at index `i` replaced by the index popped from `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr[i]` is updated with the value popped from `m` using `m.popleft()`**
