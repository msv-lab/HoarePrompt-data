Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is appended to deque `m`. Since `m` was empty, `i` is added to `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: Number of iterations completed is less than 't' + 1, `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, `m` is a deque object containing the value of `i`.
Output State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't' + 1, `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a deque object containing the appended value 'i' for the next iteration, `m` is a deque object containing the value of `i`**
