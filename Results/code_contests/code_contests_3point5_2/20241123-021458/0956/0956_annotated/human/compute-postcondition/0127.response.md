Example Answer:
The value of `t.popleft()` is compared with the value of `i`, and the result is bitwise ANDed with the current value of `poss`. If the condition `i < t.popleft()` is true, `poss` remains as False; otherwise, `poss` will become False. The variables `t`, `m`, `n`, `arr` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is not empty and each value is updated with popped values from `m`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed.
