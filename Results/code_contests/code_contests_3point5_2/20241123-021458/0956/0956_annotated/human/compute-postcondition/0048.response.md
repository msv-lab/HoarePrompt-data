Example Answer:
The program takes an input and assigns it to variable `s`. The variable `n` is an input integer, and the number of iterations completed is less than 't'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string.
Output State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string**
