According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `t`. If the length of `t` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is not empty, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the number of indices in `t`, `i` is 1, and the comparison result is stored in `poss`. For the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `t` must be greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `t` is not empty, `arr` is a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the number of indices in `t`, `i` is 1, and the comparison result is stored in `poss`, length of `t` is greater than 4**
