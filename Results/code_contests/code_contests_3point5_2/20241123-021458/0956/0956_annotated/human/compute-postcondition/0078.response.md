Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in the list `arr` is updated with the value popped from the left end of the deque `m`. The previous values of `arr`, `m`, and `i` are known. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' character, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the value at index `i` replaced by the index popped from `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr[i]` is updated with the value popped from `m` using `m.popleft()`.
Output State: **`s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' character, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with the value at index `i` replaced by the index popped from `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr[i]` is updated with the value popped from `m` using `m.popleft()`**
