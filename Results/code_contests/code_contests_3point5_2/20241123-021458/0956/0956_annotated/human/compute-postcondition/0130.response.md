According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is not empty and each value is updated with popped values from `m`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed + 1, and `poss` is False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- The `arr` should still not be empty.
- The value of `i` needs to be updated to the number of iterations completed + 2 to indicate the next iteration.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` has at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is not empty and each value is updated with popped values from `m`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed + 2, and `poss` is False**
