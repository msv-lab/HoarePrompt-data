Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: Before the execution of the program fragment: `s` is the input string, if `s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise. `n` is an input integer.
