Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The number of iterations completed is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is an input integer**
