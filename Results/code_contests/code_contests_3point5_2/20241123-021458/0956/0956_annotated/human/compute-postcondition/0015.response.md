Example Answer: 
The code writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. The value of `sep` is ' ', so a space character is written to the file. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`**
