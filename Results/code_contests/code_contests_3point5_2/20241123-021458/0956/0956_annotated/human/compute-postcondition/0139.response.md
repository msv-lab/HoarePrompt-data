Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input values `t`, `n`, and `s`, processes the string `s` based on the indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters, and determines if a specific condition is met. If the condition is met, it calls another function `func_2` with 'YES' as an argument; otherwise, it calls `func_2` with 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value. The output state after the loop execution depends on the number of 'T' characters in the input string `s` and the comparison of indices in `t` and `m`.**
