Postcondition: ***`t` contains the indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise. If `s` is empty, `t` and `m` are empty, `n` is 0, and `poss` is False. If poss is True, then after the execution of the if block, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list where each value is updated with the popped values from `m`, and `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed. If the length of `t` is less than 2 or the length of `m` is 0, the loop will not execute.***
