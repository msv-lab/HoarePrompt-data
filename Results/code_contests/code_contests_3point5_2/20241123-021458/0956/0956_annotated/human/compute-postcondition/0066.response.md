Output State: **If the string `s` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `t` and `m` will remain as empty deque objects. If the string `s` is not empty, the loop will iterate through the characters of `s` and append the index `i` to deque `t` if the character is 'T', otherwise, it will append the index `i` to deque `m`. After the loop finishes, `n` will be the length of string `s`, `t` will contain the indices of 'T' characters, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters.**
