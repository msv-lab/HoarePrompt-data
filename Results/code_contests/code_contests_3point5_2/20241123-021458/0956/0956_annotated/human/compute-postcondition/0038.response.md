According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `t` is not empty, `arr` contains elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices, `poss` is the result of bitwise AND operations between comparisons of elements in `t` and `m`, `i` is the number of iterations completed. If `t` is empty, `arr` is an empty list, `poss` is True, `i` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` needs to have more elements, so it should have elements dequeued from `t`. The other states remain the same.
State: **If `t` is not empty, `arr` contains more elements dequeued from `t` and assigned to corresponding indices, `poss` is the result of bitwise AND operations between comparisons of elements in `t` and `m`, `i` is the number of iterations completed. If `t` is empty, `arr` is an empty list, `poss` is True, `i` is incremented by 1**
