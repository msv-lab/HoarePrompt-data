Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `s` is not empty. If `(i, si)` is 'T', then the character is appended to list `t`. If `(i, si)` is not 'T', then the character is appended to list `m`. In both cases, `t` and `m` are updated to include the next character. The length of string `s`, `n`, is updated accordingly. The balance of 'T' and non-'T' characters in `poss` is modified based on the character added to `t` or `m`.***
