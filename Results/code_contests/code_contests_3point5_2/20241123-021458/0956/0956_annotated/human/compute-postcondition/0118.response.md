According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t` and `i`. If `i` is less than half the length of `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list where the value at index 0 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `i` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so that it does not exceed half the length of `t`. 
State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list where the value at index 0 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `i` is 1**
