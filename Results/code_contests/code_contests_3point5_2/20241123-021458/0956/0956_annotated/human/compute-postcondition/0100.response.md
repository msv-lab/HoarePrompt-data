Example Answer:
The index `i` is appended to the list `m`. Since `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, it will now include the index `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters including the newly appended index `i`, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise, `t` is an empty deque, and `(i, si)` is the first element of the string `s` where si is not equal to 'T'.
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `s` is not empty, `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters including the newly appended index `i`, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise, `t` is an empty deque, and `(i, si)` is the first element of the string `s` where si is not equal to 'T'**
