Example Answer: 
The deque function creates an empty deque object and assigns it to the variable `t`. As no other variables are affected, the output state is: Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `t` is an empty deque object.
Output State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `t` is an empty deque object**
