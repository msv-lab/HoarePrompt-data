Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of `arr` is assigned the value popped from the left end of the `m` queue. The value of `i` is 0, so the value at index 0 of `arr` is updated. The length of `arr` is half the number of 'T' characters indices, so the length remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list where the value at index 0 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list where the value at index 0 is updated with the popped value from `m`, `i` is 0**
