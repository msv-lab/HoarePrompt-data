According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string `s`. The loop will iterate for the length of string `s`. Therefore, the loop will execute successfully if the length of string `s` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the number of iterations completed is less than 't' does not affect the loop execution. Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` and `m` are empty deque objects.
State: **Number of iterations completed is less than 't', `n` is the length of string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is an empty deque object, `m` is an empty deque object**
