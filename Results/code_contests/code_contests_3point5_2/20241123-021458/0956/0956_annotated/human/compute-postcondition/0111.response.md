Output State: **If `s` is not empty, after the loop executes, `t` will contain the indices of 'T' characters, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` will be the length of string `s`, and `poss` will be True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `t` and `m` will remain empty, `n` will be 0, and `poss` will be False.**
