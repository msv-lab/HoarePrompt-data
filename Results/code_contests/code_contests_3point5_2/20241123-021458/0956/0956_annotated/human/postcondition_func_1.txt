The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to the standard output with a space separator. It then writes the value specified by the 'end' key in `kwargs` or a newline character by default. If the 'flush' key in `kwargs` is True, it flushes the output. The function does not return any specific output.
