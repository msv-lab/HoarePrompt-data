Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given string can be partitioned into disjoint subsequences, all equal to "TMT". It checks if the number of 'M' characters is exactly half the number of 'T' characters, then it proceeds to check the indices of 'T' and 'M' characters to ensure that they can form valid subsequences. The program handles multiple test cases and outputs "YES" if the partition exists and "NO" otherwise. The logic and conditions in the code align with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
