You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The student council has a shared document file. Every day, some members of the student council write the sequence TMT (short for Towa Maji Tenshi) in it.

However, one day, the members somehow entered the sequence into the document at the same time, creating a jumbled mess. Therefore, it is Suguru Doujima's task to figure out whether the document has malfunctioned. Specifically, he is given a string of length n whose characters are all either T or M, and he wants to figure out if it is possible to partition it into some number of disjoint subsequences, all of which are equal to TMT. That is, each character of the string should belong to exactly one of the subsequences.

A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (3 ≤ n < 10^5), the number of characters in the string entered in the document. It is guaranteed that n is divisible by 3.

The second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of only the characters T and M.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing YES if the described partition exists, and a single line containing NO otherwise.

Example

Input


5
3
TMT
3
MTT
6
TMTMTT
6
TMTTTT
6
TTMMTT


Output


YES
NO
YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, the string itself is already a sequence equal to TMT.

In the third test case, we may partition the string into the subsequences TMTMTT. Both the bolded and the non-bolded subsequences are equal to TMT.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: 
    #Before the execution of the loop, `s` is the input string, if `s` is not empty, `t` contains the indices of 'T' characters, `m` contains the indices of non-'T' characters, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `poss` is True if the number of non-'T' characters is double the number of 'T' characters, False otherwise. 
    #After the loop executes:
    #- If there are at least 2 'T' characters in `t`, then after the loop, `s` will still not be empty, `t` will contain at least 1 index of 'T' character, `m` will contain the indices of non-'T' characters except the first one, `n` will be the length of string `s`, `poss` will be False, `arr` will still have elements to iterate over, and `i` will be pointing to the next element in the list.
    #- If there are no 'T' characters in `t`, the loop will not execute, and the values of the variables will remain the same as in the initial state.
    #- If the length of `t` is less than 2 or the length of `m` is 0, the loop will not execute.
    #
    #**Based on the loop logic and initial conditions, the output state after the loop executes will depend on the number of 'T' characters in the input string `s` and the comparison of the indices in `t` and `m`.**

If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute and `at_start` remains True. `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` is executed. If `kwargs` has 'flush' key with a value of True, then `file` is flushed.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
