Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to partition a given string into disjoint subsequences, all of which are equal to TMT. The program reads the input, checks if the partition is possible, and then outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly for each test case. The logic is sound and covers all the cases as described in the problem statement. The program handles the scenario where the number of characters in the string entered in the document is divisible by 3, and it accurately determines if the partition exists or not. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the implementation of the program, it can be deemed correct.
