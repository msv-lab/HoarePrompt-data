Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input as described in the problem statement, processes it accordingly, and outputs "YES" if the described partition exists, and "NO" otherwise. The logic of the program seems to be correct as it checks if the number of 'M's is half of the number of 'T's, and then proceeds to check if the subsequences can be formed in the given order. The program also uses deques efficiently to handle the indices of 'T's and 'M's. Overall, the program seems to be correctly implemented based on the problem description.
