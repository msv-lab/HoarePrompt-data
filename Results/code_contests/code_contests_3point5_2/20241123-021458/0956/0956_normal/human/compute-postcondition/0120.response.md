Example Answer: 
The element dequeued from the left of `m` is assigned to `arr[i]`. The length of `t` is either greater than 1 or 1, and the value of `poss` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `poss` is True or False, `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element, and the length of `t` is either greater than 1 or 1.
Output State: **`poss` is True or False, `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element, and the length of `t` is either greater than 1 or 1**
