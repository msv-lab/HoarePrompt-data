According to the code, the loop will execute if the list `s` is not empty. So, for the loop to execute, the list `s` must have at least 1 element. At the start of the loop, `i` will be the index of the element in `s` and `si` will be the element itself.

State: **`s` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `si` is the first element in the list**
