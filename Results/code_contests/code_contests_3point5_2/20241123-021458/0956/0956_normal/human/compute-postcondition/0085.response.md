According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions must be met for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `s` is a list with at least one element.
2. `t` has a length of at least 2.
3. `poss` is False.
4. `arr` has at least one more element.
5. The leftmost element of `t` after popping it is greater than `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `t` has a length of at least 2, `poss` is False, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is less than the leftmost element of `t` after popping it**
