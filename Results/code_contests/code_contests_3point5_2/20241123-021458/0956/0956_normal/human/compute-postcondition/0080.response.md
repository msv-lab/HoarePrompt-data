Output State: `s` is a list with at least one element. If `s` has at least one element, after the loop executes, `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise `poss` is False. `arr` is a list where elements are removed from the left of `m` and assigned to it based on the comparison of elements from `t` and `m`. The loop will not execute if `t` has a length less than 2.
