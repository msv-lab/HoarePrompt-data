Example Answer: 
The `write` function writes the value of `sep` to the file. The variables `t`, `n`, and `args` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least two arguments.
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least two arguments**
