Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the arguments in `args`, writing them to a file specified by `file.write()`. The function handles multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and an integer `n` representing the length of a string. The function ensures `n` is divisible by 3. The function outputs the test results according to the constraints specified.**
