According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has a length of at least 2, `m` is not empty, `poss` is True, `arr` has been updated with dequeued elements from `t`, and the length of `t` is now reduced by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must not be empty.
State: **If the length of list `t` is at least 2, `m` is not empty, `poss` is True, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is now reduced by 1, `arr` is not empty**
