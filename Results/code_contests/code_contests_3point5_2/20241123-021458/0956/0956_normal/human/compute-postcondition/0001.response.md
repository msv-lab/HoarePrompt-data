Example Answer:
The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values based on the keyword arguments `kwargs`. If no keyword arguments are provided, `sep` is assigned the value `' '` and `file` is assigned the value `sys.stdout`. The values of `sep` and `file` are affected, while other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3. The string entered in the document consists of characters T and M. `sep` is ' ' and `file` is sys.stdout**
