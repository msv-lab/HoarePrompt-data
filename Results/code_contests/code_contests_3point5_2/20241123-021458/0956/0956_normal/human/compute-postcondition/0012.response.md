Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and then written to the file. The state of `t`, `n`, and `args` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least two arguments.
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least two arguments**
