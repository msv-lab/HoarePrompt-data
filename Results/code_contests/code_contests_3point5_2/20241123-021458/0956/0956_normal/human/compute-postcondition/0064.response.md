Postcondition: ***`poss` is either True or False, `arr` contains elements from deque `m` or `t` based on the value of the second element in `s`, `i` is 2, `t` contains all previous elements with `i` appended at the end if the second element of `s` is 'T', otherwise `m` contains all previous elements with `i` appended at the end, `n` is an input integer, `s` is assigned the input value with at least one element, `t` may contain the value 0 or not, `m` may contain the element 0 or not, `si` is the second element in `s`. If the second element of `s` is 'T', then `i` is appended to deque `t`, otherwise `i` is appended to deque `m`.***
