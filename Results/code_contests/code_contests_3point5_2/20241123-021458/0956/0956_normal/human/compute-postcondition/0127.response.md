Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared with the value dequeued from the left of list `t`. If `i` is less than the dequeued value, `poss` remains True; otherwise, it becomes False. The length of `t` decreases by 1 due to the `popleft()` operation. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: If the length of list `t` is at least 2, `m` is not empty, `poss` is True, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is now reduced by 1.
Output State: **If the length of list `t` is at least 2, `m` is not empty, `poss` is True, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is now reduced by 1**
