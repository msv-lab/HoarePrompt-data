According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `args` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least two arguments, and `at_start` is False. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `args` list must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least 4 arguments, `at_start` is False**
