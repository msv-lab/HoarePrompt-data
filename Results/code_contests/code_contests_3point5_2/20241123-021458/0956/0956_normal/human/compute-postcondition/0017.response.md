Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file. The previous values of the affected variables are `t`, `n`, `args`, `at_start`. No changes are made to these variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least 4 arguments, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least 4 arguments, `at_start` is False**
