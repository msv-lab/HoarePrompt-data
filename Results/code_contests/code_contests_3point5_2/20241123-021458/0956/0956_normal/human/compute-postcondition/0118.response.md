According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. If the length of `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `poss` is True if the dequeued element from `t` is less than the first element in `m`; otherwise, poss is False, and `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must have a length greater than 1.
State: **`poss` is True if the dequeued element from `t` is less than the first element in `m`; otherwise, poss is False, `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element, and the length of `t` is greater than 1**
