According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is not empty. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `arr` should still be not empty.
State: **If the length of list `t` is at least 1, `m` is not empty, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is reduced by 1, `arr` is not empty**
