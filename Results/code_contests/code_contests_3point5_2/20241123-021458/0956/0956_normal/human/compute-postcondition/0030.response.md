Example Answer:
The value removed from the left end of deque `t` is assigned to the element at index `i` of list `arr`, and `i` is then incremented by 1. The condition `i` is less than half the length of deque `t` plus 1 is checked, and `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the condition that the value removed from the left end of deque `t` is less than the first element of list `m`. The output state is: `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the element at index `i` replaced by the value removed from the left end of deque `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the condition that the value removed from the left end of deque `t` is less than the first element of list `m`.
Output State: **`poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the element at index `i` replaced by the value removed from the left end of deque `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the condition that the value removed from the left end of deque `t` is less than the first element of list `m`**
