According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are arguments in `args`. Since no specific conditions are given regarding the values in `args`, we can assume that there is at least one argument in `args` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least one argument.
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least one argument**
