Postcondition: ***If `s` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` has at least one element and `t` has a length of at least 2, then after the loop executes, `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise `poss` is False. `arr` is a list with elements removed from the left of `m` based on comparison with `t`. If `t` has a length less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `poss` remains False.***
