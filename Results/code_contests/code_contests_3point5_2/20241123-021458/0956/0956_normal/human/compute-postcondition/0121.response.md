According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `t`. If the length of `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `poss` is True or False, `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element, and the length of `t` is either greater than 1 or 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the length of `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`poss` is True or False, `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element, and the length of `t` is greater than 2**
