According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `poss` could be True or False based on the condition explained. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again, and `arr` will contain elements from deque `m`. `i` will be equal to the length of `t` minus 1. After the loop executes, `poss` will be True if all comparisons hold, otherwise False. The function `func_2` is called with 'YES' if `poss` is True, and 'NO' if `poss` is False.
State: **`poss` is either True or False, `arr` contains elements from deque `m`, `i` is equal to the length of `t` minus 1, `t` is greater than 0**
