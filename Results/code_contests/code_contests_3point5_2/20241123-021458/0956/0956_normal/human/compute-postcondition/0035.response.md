Output State: **If the length of deque `t` is less than 2, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, `poss` will be either True or False depending on the conditions evaluated in each iteration. The `arr` list will contain the elements removed from the left end of deque `t` in each iteration, and `i` will be incremented accordingly.**
