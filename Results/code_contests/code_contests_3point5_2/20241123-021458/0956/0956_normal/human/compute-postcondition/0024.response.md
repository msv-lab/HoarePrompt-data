Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 10^5 divisible by 3, and the contents of `args` are updated based on the number of arguments in `args`. If the 'flush' key existed in `kwargs`, it was removed from the dictionary. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
