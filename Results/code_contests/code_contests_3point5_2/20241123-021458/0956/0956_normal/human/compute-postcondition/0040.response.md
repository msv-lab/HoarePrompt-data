According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the length of deque `t` is decreased by 1, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` is less than the length of `arr`. To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in `arr`.
State: **Length of deque `t` is decreased by 1, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
