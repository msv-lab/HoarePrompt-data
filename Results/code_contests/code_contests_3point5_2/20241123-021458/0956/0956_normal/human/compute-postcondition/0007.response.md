Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file. The value of `x` is unknown, so the output state is: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least one argument. If at_start is False, then the file writes sep. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least one argument. If at_start is False, then the file writes sep. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.**
