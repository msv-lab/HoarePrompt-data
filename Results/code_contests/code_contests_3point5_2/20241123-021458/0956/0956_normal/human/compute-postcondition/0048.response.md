Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input. The other variables `poss`, `arr`, `m`, `i`, `t`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `poss` is either True or False, `arr` contains elements from deque `m`, `i` is equal to the length of `t` minus 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is assigned the input value.
Output State: **`poss` is either True or False, `arr` contains elements from deque `m`, `i` is equal to the length of `t` minus 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is assigned the input value**
