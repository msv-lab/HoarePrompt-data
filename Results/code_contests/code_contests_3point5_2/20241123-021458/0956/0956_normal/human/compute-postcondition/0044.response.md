Postcondition: ***The variable `poss` is assigned the boolean value True if the length of deque `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of deque `t`, otherwise False. If the length of deque `t` is less than 2, `arr` remains empty, and no comparisons are made. After the loop executes, `poss` will be True if all comparisons hold, otherwise False. `arr` will contain elements from deque `m`, and `i` will be equal to the length of `t` minus 1.***
