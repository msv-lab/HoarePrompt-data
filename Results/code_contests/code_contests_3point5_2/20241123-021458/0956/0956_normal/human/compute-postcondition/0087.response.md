According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `arr` list. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list with at least one element, `t` has at least one element, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is less than the leftmost element of `t` after popping it. For the loop to execute one more time, the `arr` list must still have at least one element. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` has at least one more element.
State: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `t` has at least one element, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` has at least two elements, `i` is less than the leftmost element of `t` after popping it**
