Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, the length of deque `t` is decreased by 1, and `poss` is bitwise ANDed with the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. Depending on the values of `i` and the deque `t`, `poss` will be updated to either True or False. The variable `arr` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **Length of deque `t` is decreased by 1, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
