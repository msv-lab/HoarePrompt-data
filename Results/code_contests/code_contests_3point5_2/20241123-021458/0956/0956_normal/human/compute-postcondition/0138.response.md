The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the previously mentioned parameter constraints: t, n, and s. t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer such that 3 â‰¤ n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, and s is a string of length n consisting of only the characters T and M. The function does not return a specific value but likely performs some operations or calculations based on the given parameters.
