Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared to the value dequeued from the left of list `t`. If `i` is less than the dequeued value, `poss` is updated to False. The length of list `t` is reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If the length of list `t` is at least 2, `m` is not empty, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is reduced by 1, `arr` is not empty.
Output State: **If the length of list `t` is at least 2, `m` is not empty, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is reduced by 1, `arr` is not empty**
