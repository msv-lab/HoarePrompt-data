Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `m`. The initial state states that `i` is 2, and depending on the second element in list `s`, either `t` or `m` contains [0, 1]. Since the second element in `s` determines whether `m` or `t` is present, the output state will be either `s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `t` contains [0, 1, 2] or `s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `m` contains [0, 1, 2].
Output State: **`s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `t` contains [0, 1, 2]** or **`s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `m` contains [0, 1, 2]**
