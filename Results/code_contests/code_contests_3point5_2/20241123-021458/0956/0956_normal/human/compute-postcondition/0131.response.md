Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared to the first element of the list `t` after removing it. If `i` is less than the dequeued element, `poss` is updated to False; otherwise, `poss` retains its previous value. The length of list `t` is reduced by 1. Since `poss` is modified and `t` is dequeued, the output state is: If the length of list `t` is at least 1 (one element removed), `m` is not empty, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is reduced by 1, `arr` is not empty.
Output State: **If the length of list `t` is at least 1, `m` is not empty, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is reduced by 1, `arr` is not empty**
