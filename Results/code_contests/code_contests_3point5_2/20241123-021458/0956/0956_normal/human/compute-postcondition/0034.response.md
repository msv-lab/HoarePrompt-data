According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `t`. If the length of the list is such that `len(t) // 2` is greater than the current value of `i`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the updated element, `i` is incremented by 2. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2 again, and the length of the list `t` needs to be such that `len(t) // 2` is greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the updated element, `i` is incremented by 4**
