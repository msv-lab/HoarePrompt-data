According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr` and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, Length of deque `t` is 1 or more, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is empty, `i` is 0, `poss` is either True or False. Since `arr` is empty, the loop cannot be executed again unless the `arr` is populated with at least one element and `i` is less than the length of `arr`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, adjust the `arr` to have at least one element and set `i` to be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **Length of deque `t` is 1 or more, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` has at least one element, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, `poss` is either True or False**
