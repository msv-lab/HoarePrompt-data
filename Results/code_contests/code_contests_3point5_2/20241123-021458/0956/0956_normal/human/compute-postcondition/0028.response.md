According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than half the length of deque `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the element at index `i` replaced by the value removed from the left end of deque `t`, `i` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than half the length of deque `t` plus 1.
State: **`poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the element at index `i` replaced by the value removed from the left end of deque `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than half the length of deque `t` plus 1**
