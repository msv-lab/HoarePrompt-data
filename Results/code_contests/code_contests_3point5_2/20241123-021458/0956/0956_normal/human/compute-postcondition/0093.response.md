Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the value `input()`, which accepts an input. The loop execution and further modifications depend on the values of `s`, `t`, and `m`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state after this line is: If `s` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` has at least one element and `t` has a length of at least 3, then after the loop executes, `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise `poss` is False. `arr` is a list with elements removed from the left of `m` based on comparison with `t`. If `t` has a length less than 3, the loop does not execute, and `poss` remains False. `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'. `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
