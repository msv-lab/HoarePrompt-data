According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr` and `t`. If the length of list `t` is at least 2 and `m` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, for the loop to execute, `t` must have a length of at least 2 and `m` must not be empty. After the loop executes, `poss` will be True if each dequeued element from `t` is less than the corresponding element in `m`, otherwise poss will be False. Additionally, `arr` will be updated with the dequeued elements from `t`, and the length of `t` will be greater than 1. If the length of `t` is less than 2 or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute, and poss will remain True, `arr` will not be updated, and the length of `t` will remain the same.

State: **If the length of list `t` is at least 2, `m` is not empty, `poss` is True, `arr` is updated with dequeued elements from `t`, length of `t` is greater than 1**
