The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases where the constraints are specified for each test case. For each test case, the function expects an integer `t` representing the number of test cases to be processed. For each test case, the function expects an integer `n` representing the length of a string, where `n` is divisible by 3. The string entered in the document consists of characters 'T' and 'M'.

The functionality of the function `func_2` is to process multiple test cases with the specified constraints.
