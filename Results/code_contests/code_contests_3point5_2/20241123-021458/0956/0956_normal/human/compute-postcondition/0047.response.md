Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `poss` is either True or False, `arr` contains elements from deque `m`, `i` is equal to the length of `t` minus 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`poss` is either True or False, `arr` contains elements from deque `m`, `i` is equal to the length of `t` minus 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
