Example Answer:
`arr[i]` is assigned the value dequeued from `m`. The value of `poss` depends on whether the dequeued element is less than the first element in `m`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: poss is True if the dequeued element from `t` is less than the first element in `m`; otherwise, poss is False, and `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element.
Output State: **poss is True if the dequeued element from `t` is less than the first element in `m`; otherwise, poss is False, and `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element**
