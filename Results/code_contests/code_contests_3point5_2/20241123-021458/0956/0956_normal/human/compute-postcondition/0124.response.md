According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the deque `t`. If the length of `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `poss` is True or False, `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element from `t`, and the length of `t` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, the length of `t` should still be greater than 1 after dequeuing an element. Therefore, the length of `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2.
State: **`poss` is True or False, `arr[i]` is updated with the dequeued element from `t`, and the length of `t` is greater than 2**
