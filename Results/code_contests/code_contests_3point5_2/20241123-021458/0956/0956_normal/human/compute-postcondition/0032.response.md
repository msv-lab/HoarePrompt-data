Example Answer:
The value removed from the left end of deque `t` is compared with the first element of list `m`, and if it is less, then `poss` is updated to `True`. The length of `t` should be greater than or equal to 4 for this operation. The index `i` is then incremented by 2 and the element at index `i` in list `arr` is replaced by the value removed from deque `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the updated element, `i` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the updated element, `i` is incremented by 2**
