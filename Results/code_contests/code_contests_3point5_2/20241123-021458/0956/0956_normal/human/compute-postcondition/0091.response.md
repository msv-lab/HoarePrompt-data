According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` has a length of at least 2, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is an empty list, the loop does not execute. If `s` has at least one element and `t` has a length of at least 2, then `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise `poss` is False. `arr` is a list with elements removed from the left of `m` based on comparison with `t`. If `t` has a length less than 2, the loop does not execute. `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` needs to have a length of at least 2. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **If `s` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` has at least one element and `t` has a length of at least 3, then after the loop executes, `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise `poss` is False. `arr` is a list with elements removed from the left of `m` based on comparison with `t`. If `t` has a length less than 3, the loop does not execute, and `poss` remains False. `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES' if `poss` is True, otherwise 'NO'.**
