Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared with the value of the element removed from the left of `t`. If `i` is less than this value, `poss` is updated to True; otherwise, it remains False. The value of `poss` could change based on the comparison result. Therefore, the Output State is: Length of deque `t` is decreased by 1, `poss` is either True or False based on the comparison, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is less than the length of `arr`.
Output State: **Length of deque `t` is decreased by 1, `poss` is either True or False based on the comparison, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is less than the length of `arr`**
