Example Answer: 
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least two arguments, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, `args` contains at least two arguments, `at_start` is False**
