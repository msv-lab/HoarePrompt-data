Example Answer: 
The element at index `i` in the list `arr` is assigned the value popped from the left of the deque `m`. The value of `i` is incremented by 2, so the new value of `i` is affected. The states of `poss` and the list `arr` are not directly affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the updated element, `i` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`poss` is either True or False, `arr` is a list with the updated element, `i` is incremented by 2**
