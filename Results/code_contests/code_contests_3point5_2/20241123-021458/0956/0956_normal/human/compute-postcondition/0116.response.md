Example Answer:
The code snippet dequeues an element from the `t` queue and checks if it is less than the first element in the `m` list. If the condition is True, `poss` remains True; otherwise, it becomes False. The previous state of `poss` is True. Therefore, the output state is poss is True if the dequeued element from `t` is less than the first element in `m`; otherwise, poss is False.
Output State: **poss is True if the dequeued element from `t` is less than the first element in `m`; otherwise, poss is False**
