Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `t`. Since `i` is 0, the list `t` will now contain [0]. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `si` is the first element in the list, the first element in the list is 'T', `t` is a list containing [0].
Output State: **`s` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `si` is the first element in the list, the first element in the list is 'T', `t` is a list containing [0]**
