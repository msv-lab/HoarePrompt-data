According to the code, the loop will only execute if the length of deque `t` is at least 2. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that the length of deque `t` is 2 or more. Additionally, since `arr` will contain elements removed from the left end of deque `t` in each iteration, the state should reflect that `arr` is empty initially. Lastly, `i` should be set to 0 at the start.
State: **Length of deque `t` is 2 or more, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is empty, `i` is 0**
