Example Answer: 
The code checks if `i` is less than the leftmost element of `t` after popping it. If the condition is met, `poss` is updated to True, else it remains False. The initial state has `t` with a length of at least 2, and `i` is less than the leftmost element of `t` after popping it. After executing the code, the value of `poss` will depend on the comparison result. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list with at least one element, `t` has at least one element, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is less than the leftmost element of `t` after popping it.
Output State: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `t` has at least one element, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is less than the leftmost element of `t` after popping it**
