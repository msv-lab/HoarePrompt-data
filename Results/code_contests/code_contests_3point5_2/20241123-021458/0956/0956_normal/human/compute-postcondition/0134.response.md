Postcondition: ***If the list `s` is empty, then `t` and `m` are also empty lists. If the length of `t` is at least 2 and `m` is not empty, after the loop executes, `poss` will be True if each dequeued element from `t` is less than the corresponding element in `m`, otherwise `poss` will be False. Additionally, `arr` will be updated with the dequeued elements from `t`, and the length of `t` will be reduced by 1. If the length of `t` is less than 2 or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `poss` will remain True, `arr` will not be updated, and the length of `t` will remain the same.***
