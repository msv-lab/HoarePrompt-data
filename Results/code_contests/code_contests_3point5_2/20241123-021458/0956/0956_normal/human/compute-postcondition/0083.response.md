According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If there are more elements in the `arr` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list with at least one element, `t` has a length of at least 2, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with elements removed from the left of `m` based on comparison, `m` length multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, `poss` is False.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `arr` list must have at least one more element. Hence, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `t` has a length of at least 2, `poss` is False, `arr` is a list with elements removed from the left of `m` based on comparison, `m` length multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, `poss` is False, `arr` has at least one more element**
