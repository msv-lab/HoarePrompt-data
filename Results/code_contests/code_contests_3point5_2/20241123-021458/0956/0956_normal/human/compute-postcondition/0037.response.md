Example Answer:
The value of `i` is compared to the leftmost element of the deque `t`, and if `i` is less than that element, `poss` is set to False. The previous values of the variables are `t` with a length of 2 or more, `poss` either True or False, `arr` is empty, and `i` is 0. After execution, if `i` is less than the leftmost element of `t`, `poss` will be False. Therefore, the Output State is: Length of deque `t` is 1 or more, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is empty, `i` is 0, `poss` is either True or False.
Output State: **Length of deque `t` is 1 or more, `poss` is either True or False, `arr` is empty, `i` is 0, `poss` is either True or False**
