Output State: 
After the loop executes, `poss` will be True if all comparisons hold, otherwise False. `arr` will contain elements from deque `m`, and `i` will be equal to the length of `t` minus 1. If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and `poss` will remain False. If `s` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `t` and `m` remain empty deques. If `s` has at least one element and `t` has a length of at least 2, then after the loop executes, `poss` is True if the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, otherwise `poss` is False. `arr` is a list with elements removed from the left of `m` based on comparison with `t`. If the list `s` is empty, then `t` and `m` are also empty lists. If the length of `t` is at least 2 and `m` is not empty, after the loop executes, `poss` will be True if each dequeued element from `t` is less than the corresponding element in `m`, otherwise `poss` will be False. If the length of `t` is less than 2 or `m` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `poss` will remain True, `arr` will not be updated, and the length of `t` will remain the same. The function `func_2` will be called with either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `poss`.
