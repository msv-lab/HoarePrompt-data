Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `t`. Since `i` is 1 and `t` starts with [0], after the execution, `t` will be [0, 1]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `si` is the second element in the list, `t` contains [0, 1].
Output State: **`s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `si` is the second element in the list, `t` contains [0, 1]**
