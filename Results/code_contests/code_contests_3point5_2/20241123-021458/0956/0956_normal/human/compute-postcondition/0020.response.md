Output State: 
The loop writes the arguments in `args` to the file using `file.write()`. If `at_start` is False, it writes the separator `sep` before each argument. After the loop executes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 10^5 divisible by 3. If `args` contains at least one argument, then after the loop executes, it will contain the written arguments. If `at_start` is false, the file will have the separator `sep`. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute, and there are no changes in the program state.
**If args is not empty, then t, n, args, and at_start will be updated accordingly based on the number of arguments in args. If args is empty, the loop does not execute, and there is no change in the program state.**
