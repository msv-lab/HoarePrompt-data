The function `func` reads input values for two integers `a` and `b`, then reads a list of integers representing TV set prices. It sorts the prices, takes the first `b` elements, calculates their sum, and prints the negative of that sum. The function does not return any value explicitly. However, there are potential edge cases and missing functionality in the annotations:

- The annotations mention a positive integer `n`, but the code does not directly handle or mention `n`.
- The code does not handle any exceptions that might occur during input reading or processing.
- The code does not provide any error messages or handling for invalid inputs.
- The function does not explicitly return any values based on the input parameters as mentioned in the annotations.
