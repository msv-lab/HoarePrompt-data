Example Answer:
The lambda function `r` is called and returns two values assigned to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the implementation of the lambda function `r`. Since the lambda function `r` and its implementation are not provided, the specific values of `a` and `b` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and the lambda function `r` is defined.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and the lambda function `r` is defined**
