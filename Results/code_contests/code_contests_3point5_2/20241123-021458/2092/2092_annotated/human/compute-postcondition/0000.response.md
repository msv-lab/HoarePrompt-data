Example Answer:
The lambda function `r` takes input from the user, splits it, and converts each element to an integer. Since the initial state does not mention any specific values for `n` and `m`, the output state will be: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and the lambda function `r` is defined.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and the lambda function `r` is defined.**
