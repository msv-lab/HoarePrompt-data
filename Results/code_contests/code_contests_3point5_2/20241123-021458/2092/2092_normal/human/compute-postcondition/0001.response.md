Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the return values of the function `r()`. The function `r()` returns two values, so `a` and `b` will hold those returned values. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the logic inside the `r()` function. Since the initial state of the variables is not provided, the output state cannot be determined accurately without knowing the implementation of the `r()` function.
Output State: **Depends on the implementation of the `r()` function**
