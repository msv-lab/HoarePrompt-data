Example Answer:
The lambda function r reads a list of integers from input and returns a map object. Since the input contains n integers, the map object will have n elements. The elements are mapped to integers from the input. Since the values are not specified, the output state will be: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 100; the list of prices ai contains n integers ranging from -1000 to 1000.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 100; the list of prices ai contains n integers ranging from -1000 to 1000**
