Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input values for the number of TV sets and the number of TV sets Bob can carry.
- It then reads the prices of the TV sets and sorts them in ascending order.
- It then takes the first `m` elements (TV sets that Bob can carry) and calculates their sum.
- Finally, it negates the sum and prints the result, which represents the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn by carrying at most `m` TV sets.

The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases, as it correctly calculates the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn based on the prices of TV sets and the number of TV sets he can carry.
