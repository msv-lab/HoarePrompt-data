Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes the input values, sorts the prices of the TV sets in ascending order, and then calculates the sum of the first m elements (as Bob can carry at most m TV sets) and subtracts it from 0. This will give Bob the maximum sum of money he can earn by choosing the TV sets with the highest negative prices or the lowest positive prices.

This logic covers all potential cases as it correctly calculates the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn based on the given constraints and requirements of the problem description.
