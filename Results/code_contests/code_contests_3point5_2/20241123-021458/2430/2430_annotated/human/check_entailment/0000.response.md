Correctness: False

The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` attempts to assign officer ranks to cities based on the given constraints, but it has some limitations. One key issue is that the code does not guarantee that on the simple path between two cities with officers of the same rank, there will always be a city with a higher-ranked officer.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
```
The correct output should be "A B B C C", where the path between cities 4 and 5 contains a city with a higher-ranked officer. However, the current implementation may not handle this situation correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not satisfy all the conditions stated in the problem description.
