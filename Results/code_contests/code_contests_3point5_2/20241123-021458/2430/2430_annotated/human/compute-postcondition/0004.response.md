Example Answer: 
`ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `cur`. Since `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, and `val` is the second element of the popped list, the value of `ind` depends on the content of the queue. Therefore, the Output State is: `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is the second element of the popped list, and `ind` is the first element of the popped list.
Output State: **`HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is the second element of the popped list, and `ind` is the first element of the popped list**
