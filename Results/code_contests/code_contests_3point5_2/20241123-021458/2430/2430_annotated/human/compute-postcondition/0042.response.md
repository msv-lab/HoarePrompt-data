According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is not specified in the given state. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to include a non-empty `queue`.
State: **The loop iterates over neighbors of a node, updating the queue with the neighbor and the incremented value if the neighbor's value in the result list is initially 0. HM remains 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index ind updated to val + 1, cur is assigned the first element popped from the queue, val is assigned the second element of cur incremented by 1, ind is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, res[sosed] is 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], val is less than or equal to HM, and queue is not empty.**
