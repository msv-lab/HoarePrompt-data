According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nodes[ind]`. If there are more neighbors in `nodes[ind]`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `ind` needs to be adjusted to the next neighbor in the `nodes` list.
2. If the next neighbor `sosed` has `res[sosed]` initially as 0, then `[sosed, val]` needs to be appended to the queue.
State: **HM remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val + 1`, `cur` is assigned the first element popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` except the next neighbor to be processed, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `sosed` is the next neighbor to be processed in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue.**
