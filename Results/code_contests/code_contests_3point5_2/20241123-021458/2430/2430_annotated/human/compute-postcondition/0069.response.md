According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `res`. If the length of `res` is greater than the current index `ind`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty, maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`. This means that the loop can execute again if the current index `ind` is less than the length of `res`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty, maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`, `ind` is less than the length of `res`**
