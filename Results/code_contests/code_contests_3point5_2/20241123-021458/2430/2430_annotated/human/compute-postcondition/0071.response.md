According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and the length of the list `res`. If `ind` is less than the length of `res`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty, maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`, `ind` is less than the length of `res`, and `val` is the value at index `ind` in the list `res`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `ind` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next index in the list `res`.
State: **`HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty, maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `val` is the value at the next index in the list `res`**
