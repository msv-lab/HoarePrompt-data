Example Answer: 
The value of `val` is assigned to the element at index `ind` in the list `res`. The previous values of `HM`, `res`, and `queue` are unchanged. The maximum value in `res` is still less than or equal to `HM`. 
Output State: **`HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty, maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`**
