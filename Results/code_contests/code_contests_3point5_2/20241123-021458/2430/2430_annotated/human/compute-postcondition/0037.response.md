According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `sosed` iterating over the neighbors of `ind` in `nodes`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `val` needs to be less than or equal to `HM`.
2. The value of `sosed` needs to be updated to the next neighbor to be processed in `nodes[ind]`.
3. If `[sosed, val]` was appended to the queue during the last iteration, then `res[sosed]` should be 0 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **HM remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val + 1`, `cur` is assigned the first element popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` except the next neighbor to be processed, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `sosed` is updated to the next neighbor to be processed in `nodes[ind]`.**
