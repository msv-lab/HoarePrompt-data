According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nodes[ind]`. If `nodes[ind]` has more elements to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `val` is further incremented by 2, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, and the condition `res[sosed]` is evaluated for the next `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` should be such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.
State: **The value of `val` is further incremented by 2, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 for the next `sosed` in `nodes[ind] added to the `queue`**
