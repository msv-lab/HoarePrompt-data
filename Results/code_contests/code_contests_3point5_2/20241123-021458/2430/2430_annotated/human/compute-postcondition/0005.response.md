Example Answer:
The value of `res` at index `ind` is assigned the value `val`. The initial state shows that `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is the second element of the popped list, and `ind` is the first element of the popped list. After execution, the value at index `ind` in `res` is updated to `val`. Therefore, the Output State is: `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is the second element of the popped list, and `ind` is the first element of the popped list.
Output State: **`HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is the second element of the popped list, and `ind` is the first element of the popped list**
