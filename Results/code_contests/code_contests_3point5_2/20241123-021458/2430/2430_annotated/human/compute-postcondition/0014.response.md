According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nodes[ind]` and the elements within it. If there are more elements in `nodes[ind]`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of n zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is the second element of the popped list incremented by 1, `ind` is the first element of the popped list, `nodes` contains `ind`, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`. If the value at index `sosed` in the list `res` is 0, then the list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **HM is 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, cur is assigned the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of the popped list incremented by 1, ind is the first element of the popped list, nodes contains `ind`, sosed is the first element in nodes[ind] where there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` other than the current `sosed`. If the value at index `sosed` in the list res is 0, then the list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue.**
