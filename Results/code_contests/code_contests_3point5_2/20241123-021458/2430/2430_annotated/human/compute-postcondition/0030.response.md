According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nodes`, `ind`, and `val`. The loop will execute if there are neighbors in the `nodes` list corresponding to the current index `ind` and if `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. Before the loop starts, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val + 1`, `cur` is assigned the first element popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, and `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `val` should not be greater than `HM`, and `sosed` should be set to the first neighbor of `nodes[ind]`.

State: **HM remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val + 1`, `cur` is assigned the first element popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `sosed` is the first neighbor in `nodes[ind]`.**
