According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nodes` and the current index `ind`. If there are more neighbors to be processed at `ind`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: 
- HM remains 51
- res is a list of n zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val + 1`
- cur is assigned the first element popped from the queue
- val is assigned the second element of `cur` incremented by 1
- ind is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list
- res[sosed] is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` except the next neighbor to be processed
- val is less than or equal to HM
- sosed is updated to the next neighbor to be processed in `nodes[ind]`
- if res[sosed] was initially 0, [sosed, val] is appended to the queue

For the loop to be executed one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- The next neighbor to be processed at `ind` must be updated in `sosed`
- If the next neighbor `sosed` has a value of 0 in `res`, then it should not have been processed yet, and [sosed, val] should be appended to the queue

State: **HM remains 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val + 1`, cur is assigned the first element popped from the queue, val is assigned the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, ind is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, res[sosed] is 0 for all `sosed` in nodes[ind] except the next neighbor to be processed, val is less than or equal to HM, sosed is updated to the next neighbor to be processed in nodes[ind], and if res[sosed] was initially 0 and sosed is the next neighbor, [sosed, val] is appended to the queue**
