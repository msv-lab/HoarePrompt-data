Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value popped from the front of the `queue`. The previous values of the variables are `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros. After executing the code, the value of `cur` depends on the queue data structure and its contents. Therefore, the Output State is: `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, and `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue.
Output State: **`HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue**
