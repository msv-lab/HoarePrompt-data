Since the loop depends on the length of `res`, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `res`. After the loop executes, `HM` remains 51, so this value should not change. The list `res` has `n` zeros, and the values are updated based on conditions inside the loop. The loop control variable `queue` will become empty at the end of the loop. To ensure the loop executes, adjust the state to reflect that `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty at the end of the loop, and the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`.
State: **`HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty at the end of the loop, maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`**
