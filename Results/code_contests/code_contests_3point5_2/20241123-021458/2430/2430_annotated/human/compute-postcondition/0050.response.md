According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nodes` and `ind`. If nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the value of `val` is incremented by 1 which means `val` needs to be adjusted to the incremented value for the loop to execute.
State: **The value of `val` is incremented by 1, nodes[ind] has at least 1 element**
