Example Answer:
A new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. Previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: The value of `val` is incremented by 2, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new list `[sosed, val+1]` is appended to the `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, no action is taken.
Output State: **The value of `val` is incremented by 2, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new list `[sosed, val+1]` is appended to the `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, no action is taken.**
