Output State: **The value of `val` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, no action is taken. If `nodes[ind]` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and no changes are made to the variables.**
