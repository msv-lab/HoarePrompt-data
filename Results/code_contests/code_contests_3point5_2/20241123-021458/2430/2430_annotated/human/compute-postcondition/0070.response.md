Example Answer:
The value of `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`, where `ind` is less than the length of `res`. The value of `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty, and the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`. The output state is: `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty, maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`, `ind` is less than the length of `res`, and `val` is the value at index `ind` in the list `res`.
Output State: **`HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated, `queue` is empty, maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`, `ind` is less than the length of `res`, and `val` is the value at index `ind` in the list `res`**
