Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, if the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, if the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to 26, the loop does not execute and `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `queue` is empty, and the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`. If the loop executes, `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated based on the condition where any value greater than 26 is transformed, `queue` is empty, and the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`.***
