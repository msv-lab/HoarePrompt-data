According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nodes[ind]`. If `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, and if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, no action is taken. So for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **The value of `val` is incremented by 2, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, and if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new list `[sosed, val+1]` is appended to the `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, no action is taken.**
