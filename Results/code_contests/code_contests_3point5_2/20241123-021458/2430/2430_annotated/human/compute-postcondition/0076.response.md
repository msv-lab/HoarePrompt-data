The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. The precondition is that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `nodes` is a list of lists representing the tree structure, where each list contains the neighboring cities of a particular city. After the if-else block executes, if the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, if the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to 26, the loop does not execute and `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `queue` is empty, and the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`. If the loop executes, `HM` remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with values updated based on the condition where any value greater than 26 is transformed, `queue` is empty, and the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. If the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, it returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, it updates the values in `res` based on certain conditions, and ensures that the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to `HM`.**
