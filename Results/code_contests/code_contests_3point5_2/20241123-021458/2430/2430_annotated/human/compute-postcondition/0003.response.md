Example Answer:
The value of `val` is assigned the second element of the `cur` list. Since `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, the value of `val` is the second element of the popped list. 
Output State: **`HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `cur` is assigned the value popped from the queue, `val` is the second element of the popped list**
