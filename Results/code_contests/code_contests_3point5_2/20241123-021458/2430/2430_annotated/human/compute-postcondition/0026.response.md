Example Answer: 
The value at index `ind` in the list `res` is updated to the value of `val`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: HM remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, and `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`.
Output State: **HM remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, and `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`**
