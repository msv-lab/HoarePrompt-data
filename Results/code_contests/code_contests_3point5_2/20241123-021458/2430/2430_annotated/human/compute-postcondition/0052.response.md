Example Answer:
A new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. The value of `val` is incremented by 1 before being appended. The initial value of `val` is not specified, but it was mentioned that it is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `val` is incremented by 1, nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.
Output State: **The value of `val` is incremented by 1, nodes[ind] has at least 1 element, and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`**
