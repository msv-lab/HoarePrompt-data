According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nodes` and `ind`. If `nodes` is a dictionary or list that can be accessed by `ind`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, HM is 51 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nodes` contains `ind` and `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`.

State: **HM is 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index ind updated to val, cur is assigned the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of the popped list incremented by 1, and ind is the first element of the popped list, nodes contains ind, sosed is the first element in nodes[ind]**
