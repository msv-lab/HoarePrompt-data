Output State: **After the loop executes, HM remains 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index ind updated to val, cur is assigned the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of the popped list incremented by 1, and ind is the first element of the popped list. If val is greater than HM, the loop breaks. If res[sosed] is 0 for all sosed in nodes[ind], the loop won't execute any further.**
