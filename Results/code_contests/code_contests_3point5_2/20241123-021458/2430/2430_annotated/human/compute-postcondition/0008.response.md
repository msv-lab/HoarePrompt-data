Postcondition: ***HM is 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index ind updated to val, cur is assigned the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of the popped list, and ind is the first element of the popped list. If val is greater than HM, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.***
