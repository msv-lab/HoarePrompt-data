According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `val` is incremented by the number of times the loop has executed, and `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new list `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, no action is taken. If `nodes[ind]` is an empty list, the loop does not execute.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`val` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, `queue` is not empty**.
