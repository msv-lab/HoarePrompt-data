Output State: **HM remains 51, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val + 1`, `cur` is assigned the first element popped from the queue, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of the first element of the popped list, and `res[sosed]` is 0 for all `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`. If `val` is greater than HM, the loop breaks.**
