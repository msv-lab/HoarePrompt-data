Example Answer:
A new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue` list. The value of `val` is incremented by 2 before being added to the list. The elements in `nodes[ind]` and the condition `res[sosed]` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `val` is further incremented by 2, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, `res[sosed]` condition is evaluated for the next `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, and a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.
Output State: **The value of `val` is further incremented by 2, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, `res[sosed]` condition is evaluated for the next `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, and a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`**
