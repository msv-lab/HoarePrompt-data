According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `nodes[ind]` and the condition of `res[sosed]`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `val` is incremented by 2. `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new list `[sosed, val+1]` is appended to the `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, no action is taken.

To execute the loop one more time, the conditions should be met as follows:
1. The value of `val` should be further incremented by 2.
2. The list `nodes[ind]` should still have at least 1 element.
3. The next element `sosed` should be considered from the list `nodes[ind]`.
4. The condition `res[sosed]` should be checked to determine the action to be taken.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time would be:
State: **The value of `val` is further incremented by 2, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, `res[sosed]` condition is evaluated for the next `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`.**
