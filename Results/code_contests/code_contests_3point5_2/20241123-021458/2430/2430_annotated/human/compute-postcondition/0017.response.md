According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` other than the current `sosed`. At the end of the last iteration, HM is 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, cur is assigned the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of the popped list incremented by 1, ind is the first element of the popped list, nodes contains `ind`, sosed is the first element in nodes[ind] where there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` other than the current `sosed`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Update `sosed` to the next element in `nodes[ind]` where there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` other than the current `sosed`.
2. If the value at index `sosed` in the list res is 0, then append the list `[sosed, val]` to the queue.

State: **HM is 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, cur is assigned the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of the popped list incremented by 1, ind is the first element of the popped list, nodes contains `ind`, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind] where there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` other than the current `sosed`**.
