According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nodes[ind]` and the condition `res[sosed] == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values are as follows: HM is 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, cur is assigned the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of the popped list incremented by 1, ind is the first element of the popped list, nodes contains `ind`, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind] where there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` other than the current `sosed`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. Update the value of `sosed` to the next element in `nodes[ind]`.
2. If there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` after updating `sosed`, check if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.
3. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, append `[sosed, val]` to the queue.

State: **HM is 51, res is a list of n zeros with the value at index `ind` updated to `val`, cur is assigned the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of the popped list incremented by 1, ind is the first element of the popped list, nodes contains `ind`, sosed is the next element in nodes[ind] where there are more elements in `nodes[ind]` other than the current `sosed`. If res[sosed] is equal to 0, then [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.**
