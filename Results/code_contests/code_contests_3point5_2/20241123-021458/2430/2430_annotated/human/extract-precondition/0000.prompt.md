You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Now Fox Ciel becomes a commander of Tree Land. Tree Land, like its name said, has n cities connected by n - 1 undirected roads, and for any two cities there always exists a path between them.

Fox Ciel needs to assign an officer to each city. Each officer has a rank — a letter from 'A' to 'Z'. So there will be 26 different ranks, and 'A' is the topmost, so 'Z' is the bottommost.

There are enough officers of each rank. But there is a special rule must obey: if x and y are two distinct cities and their officers have the same rank, then on the simple path between x and y there must be a city z that has an officer with higher rank. The rule guarantee that a communications between same rank officers will be monitored by higher rank officer.

Help Ciel to make a valid plan, and if it's impossible, output "Impossible!".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of cities in Tree Land.

Each of the following n - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) — they mean that there will be an undirected road between a and b. Consider all the cities are numbered from 1 to n.

It guaranteed that the given graph will be a tree.

Output

If there is a valid plane, output n space-separated characters in a line — i-th character is the rank of officer in the city with number i. 

Otherwise output "Impossible!".

Examples

Input

4
1 2
1 3
1 4


Output

A B B B


Input

10
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10


Output

D C B A D C B D C D

Note

In the first example, for any two officers of rank 'B', an officer with rank 'A' will be on the path between them. So it is a valid solution.
Program:
```
import sys
def func_1(queue, n, nodes):
    HM = 2 * 26 - 1
    res = [0] * n
    while queue:
        cur = queue.pop(0)
        val = cur[1]
        ind = cur[0]
        res[ind] = val
        if val > HM:
            break
        val += 1
        for sosed in nodes[ind]:
            if res[sosed] == 0:
                queue.append([sosed, val])
    if max(res) > HM:
        return 'Impossible!'
    else:
        for ind in xrange(len(res)):
            val = res[ind]
            if val > 26:
                res[ind] = 2 * 26 - val
        return ' '.join(map(lambda x: chr(26 - x + ord('A')), res))
```
