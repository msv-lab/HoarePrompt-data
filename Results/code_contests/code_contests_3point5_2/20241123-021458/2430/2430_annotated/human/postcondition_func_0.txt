The function func_1 accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. It iterates over elements in the `queue`, updating values in the `res` list based on certain conditions. If the maximum value in `res` is greater than 51 (HM), it returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, it transforms values in `res` that are greater than 26. The function ensures that the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to 51 (HM) at the end of execution. The loop may terminate early if specific conditions are met, potentially leaving some elements in `queue` unprocessed.
