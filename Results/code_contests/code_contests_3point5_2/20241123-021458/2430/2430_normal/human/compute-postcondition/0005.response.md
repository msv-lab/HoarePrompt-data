Example Answer: 
The value of `val` is assigned to the index `ind` in the list `res`. The previous values of `HM` is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the first element of `cur`. After execution, the element at index `ind` in the list `res` will be updated with the value of `val`. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the first element of `cur`, and the element at index `ind` in the list `res` is updated with the value of `val`.
Output State: **HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the first element of `cur`, and the element at index `ind` in the list `res` is updated with the value of `val`**
