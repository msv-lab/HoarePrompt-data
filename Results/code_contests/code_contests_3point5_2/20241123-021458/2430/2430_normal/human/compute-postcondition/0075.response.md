Postcondition: ***The program's output state is such that if the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the program returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, the loop iterates through each element in `res`, updating values greater than 26 to `2 * 26 - val`. After the loop executes, the variables maintain their initial values unless the condition `val > HM` is met, in which case the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to iterate through the elements in `res`, updating values greater than 26. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute further, and the variables retain their initial values. All edge cases, including boundary values, are handled within these conditions.***
