According to the code, the loop can execute again based on certain conditions. 

1. `val` should be less than or equal to `HM` for the loop to continue.
2. `res[sosed]` should be equal to 0 for a new entry `[sosed, val]` to be appended to the `queue`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `val` is the new incremented value
- `ind` remains the same
- `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`
- `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments are needed:
- `val` should be less than or equal to `HM`
- `res[sosed]` should be equal to 0

No other changes need to be made to the existing variables for the loop to continue.
State: **`val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0**
