According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in nodes[ind] and the conditions stated within the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, HM is 51, cur is the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of cur incremented by 1, ind is assigned the first element of cur, the element at index ind in the list res is updated with the new value of val, val is less than or equal to HM, nodes[ind] has at least one element. If res[sosed] is equal to 0, then [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `val` needs to be checked to ensure it is still less than or equal to `HM`.
- If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 for the current `sosed`, then the condition to append `[sosed, val]` to the queue should be met.

State: **HM is 51, cur is the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of cur incremented by 1, ind is assigned the first element of cur, the element at index ind in the list res is updated with the new value of val, val is less than or equal to HM, nodes[ind] has at least one element, and the conditions inside the loop are satisfied for the next iteration to occur.**
