Example Answer:
A new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. The `val` represents the new incremented value, and the `sosed` is a new element added to the queue. The `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, and the `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element other than the current one. As long as `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, this process continues. Therefore, the Output State is: `val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element other than the current one, `val` is less than or equal to `HM, and a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.
Output State: **`val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element other than the current one, `val` is less than or equal to `HM, and a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`**
