Example Answer:
`val` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `val` is unknown, so the new value of `val` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: *After the if statement, if val is greater than HM, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues iterating through the elements in nodes[ind]. If res[sosed] is equal to 0, [sosed, val] is appended to the queue. If nodes[ind] is empty or the elements do not meet the condition res[sosed] == 0, the loop does not execute further. At the end, ind is assigned the value cur[0] and res[ind] is assigned the new value of val.
