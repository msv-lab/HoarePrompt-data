According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and the length of the list `res`. If `ind` is less than the length of `res`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `val` is 0, `queue` is empty, elements in `nodes[ind]` satisfy `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` should be less than the length of `res` by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`val` is 0, `queue` is empty, elements in `nodes[ind]` satisfy `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` is incremented by 2**
