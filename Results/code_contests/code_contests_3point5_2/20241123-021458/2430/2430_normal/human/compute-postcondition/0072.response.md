Example Answer:
`val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`, where `ind` has been incremented by 2. Since it's given that elements in `nodes[ind]` satisfy `res[sosed] == 0`, we can assume that `res[ind]` is 0. Therefore, `val` is assigned the value of 0. The state of other variables remains the same. 
Output State: **`val` is 0, `queue` is empty, elements in `nodes[ind]` satisfy `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` is incremented by 2**
