Postcondition: ***HM is 51, cur is the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of cur, ind is assigned the first element of cur, the element at index ind in the list res is updated with the value of val. If val is greater than HM, the loop breaks. All variables retain their initial values and relationships, and if val is less than or equal to HM, the program continues executing without any change to the variables.***
