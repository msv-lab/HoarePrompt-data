You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **n is an integer representing the number of cities in Tree Land. The input consists of n - 1 lines, each containing two integers a and b representing an undirected road between cities a and b. 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b. The graph is guaranteed to be a tree.**
```
def func_1(queue, n, nodes):
```
Output: *The program's output state is such that if the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the program returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, the loop iterates through each element in `res`, updating values greater than 26 to `2 * 26 - val`. After the loop executes, the variables maintain their initial values unless the condition `val > HM` is met, in which case the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to iterate through the elements in `res`, updating values greater than 26. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute further, and the variables retain their initial values. All edge cases, including boundary values, are handled within these conditions.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
