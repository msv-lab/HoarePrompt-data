Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, the following conditions hold true: `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. All edge cases, including the boundary values, are handled within these conditions.***
