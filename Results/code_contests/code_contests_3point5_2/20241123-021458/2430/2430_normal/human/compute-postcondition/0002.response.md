Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value popped from the front of the `queue`. The previous state of `HM` is 51. Since `queue.pop(0)` removes and returns the first item in the `queue`, `cur` will be assigned the value that was at the front of the `queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`.
Output State: **HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`**
