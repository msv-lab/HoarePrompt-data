Example Answer:
A new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are used for this entry. The initial state mentions that `val` is the new incremented value, so it is added to the `queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: `val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` has at least one element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.
Output State: **`val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` has at least one element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`**
