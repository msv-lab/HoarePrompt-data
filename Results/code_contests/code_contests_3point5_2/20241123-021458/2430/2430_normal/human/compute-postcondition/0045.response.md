Example Answer: 
`ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. The value of `cur[0]` is now stored in `ind`, but the value of `val` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1], `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`.
Output State: **`val` is assigned the value of `cur[1], `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]**
