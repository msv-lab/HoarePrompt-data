According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are elements in the `nodes[ind]` list that satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`. Additionally, after the execution of the loop body, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` should be appended to the `queue` to maintain the integrity of the program state for the next iteration.

State: **`val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
