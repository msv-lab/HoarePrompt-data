According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nodes[ind]`. If nodes[ind] has at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions for the loop to execute are: HM is 51, cur is the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of cur incremented by 1, ind is assigned the first element of cur, the element at index ind in the list res is updated with the new value of val, and val is less than or equal to HM. Therefore, the variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `nodes[ind]` should have at least one element, HM is 51, cur is the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of cur incremented by 1, ind is assigned the first element of cur, the element at index ind in the list res is updated with the new value of val, and val is less than or equal to HM.
State: **HM is 51, cur is the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of cur incremented by 1, ind is assigned the first element of cur, the element at index ind in the list res is updated with the new value of val, val is less than or equal to HM, nodes[ind] has at least one element**
