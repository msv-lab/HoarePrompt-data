According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `queue` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions need to be maintained:
1. `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`.
2. `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0.
3. Elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`.
4. `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`.
5. `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`.
6. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
