According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: After the loop executes, the variables maintain their initial values unless the condition val > HM is met, in which case the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to iterate through the elements in nodes[ind], checking if res[sosed] is equal to 0 and appending [sosed, val] to the queue if the condition is satisfied. If nodes[ind] is an empty list or the elements in nodes[ind] do not meet the condition res[sosed] == 0, the loop does not execute further, and the variables retain their initial values.**
