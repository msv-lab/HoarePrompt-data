Output State: **After the execution of the if statement, the following conditions hold true: `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
