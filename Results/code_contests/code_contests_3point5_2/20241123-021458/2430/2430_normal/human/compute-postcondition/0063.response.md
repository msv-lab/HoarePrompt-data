Output State: 
After the loop executes, the variables maintain their initial values unless the condition `val > HM` is met, in which case the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to iterate through the elements in `nodes[ind]`, checking if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 and appending `[sosed, val]` to the `queue` if the condition is satisfied. If `nodes[ind]` is an empty list or the elements in `nodes[ind]` do not meet the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, the loop does not execute further, and the variables retain their initial values. All edge cases, including boundary values, are handled within these conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `val` is updated, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, elements satisfying `res[sosed] == 0` are appended to the `queue`. The loop will not execute if `val` is greater than `HM` after the if statement, or if `nodes[ind]` is empty or the elements do not meet the condition `res[sosed] == 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `val` is further incremented, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. The loop will not execute if `val` is greater than `HM` after the if statement, or if `nodes[ind]` is empty or the elements do not meet the condition `res[sosed] == 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `val` continues to increment, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the loop breaks. If `nodes[ind]` is empty or `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no changes occur to the existing variables.
