Output State: **After the loop executes, `val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the loop breaks. If `nodes[ind]` is empty or `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no changes occur to the existing variables.**
