Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` is updated with the value of `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `res[ind]` is updated with the value of `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
