Example Answer: 
The value of `val` is assigned the second element `cur[1]` and the value of `ind` is assigned the first element `cur[0]`. The value `val` is then assigned to the `res` list at index `ind`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` is updated with the value of `val`.
Output State: **`val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` is updated with the value of `val`**
