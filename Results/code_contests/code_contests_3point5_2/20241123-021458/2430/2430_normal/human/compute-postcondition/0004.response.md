Example Answer: 
`ind` is assigned the value of the first element of `cur`. The previous values of the variables are HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`, and `val` is the second element of `cur`. The value of `cur` is not specified, so the output state is: HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the first element of `cur`.
Output State: **HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the first element of `cur`**
