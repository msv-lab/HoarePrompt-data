According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `nodes` list and the conditions related to `val`, `res`, and `queue`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `val` needs to be less than `HM` and updated to a new incremented value.
- `ind` remains the same.
- The element at index `ind` in the `res` list needs to be updated with the new value of `val`.
- The list `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element other than the current one.
- If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` needs to be appended to the `queue`.
State: **`val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element other than the current one, `val` is less than `HM`, and if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
