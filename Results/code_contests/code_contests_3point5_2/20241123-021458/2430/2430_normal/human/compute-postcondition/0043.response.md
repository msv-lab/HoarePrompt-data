Example Answer:
The first element `cur` is removed from the front of the `queue`, and its value is assigned to `cur`. The previous values of the affected variables are not directly provided, but based on the given initial state where `val` is less than or equal to `HM` and `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, the `cur` variable will contain the values from the front of the `queue`. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, a new element `[sosed, val]` would have been appended to the `queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.
Output State: **`val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`. If `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`**
