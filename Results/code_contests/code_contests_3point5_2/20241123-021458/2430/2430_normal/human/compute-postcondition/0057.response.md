According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `sosed` and the elements in `nodes[ind]`. If there are more elements in `nodes[ind]`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element other than the current one, `val` is less than or equal to `HM**.
