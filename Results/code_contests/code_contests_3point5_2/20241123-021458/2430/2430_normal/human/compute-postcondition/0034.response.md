According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `nodes[ind]` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`. Additionally, if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Ensure there are more elements in the `nodes[ind]` list to iterate over.
- Update the value of `sosed` to the next element in the `nodes[ind]` list.
- Make sure all the conditions mentioned above still hold true after the adjustments.

State: **After the execution of the if statement, the following conditions hold true: `val` remains less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is still equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list continue to satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` holds the updated value of `val`. Additionally, if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. All edge cases, including the boundary values, are handled within these conditions.**
