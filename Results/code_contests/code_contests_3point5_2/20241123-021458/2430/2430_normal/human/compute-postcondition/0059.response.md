Postcondition: ***`val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element other than the current one, `val` is less than or equal to `HM, and if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.***
