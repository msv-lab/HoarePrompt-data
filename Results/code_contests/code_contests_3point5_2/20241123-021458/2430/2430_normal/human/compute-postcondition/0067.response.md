According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ind` iterates through the length of `res`. The loop will check conditions on `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]`, `val`, and `queue`. Before the loop starts, it needs to be adjusted so that `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, and the elements in `nodes[ind]` satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`. Additionally, `queue` should be empty at the start of the loop.
State: **`val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `queue` is empty, elements in `nodes[ind]` satisfy `res[sosed] == 0`**
