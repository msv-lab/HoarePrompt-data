According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `nodes` and the conditions related to `val`, `ind`, and `HM`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known: `val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` has at least one element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `ind` should remain the same.
- `val` should be incremented further but remain less than or equal to `HM`.
- If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, a new entry `[sosed, val]` should be appended to the `queue`.
- The elements in `nodes[ind]` should still be accessible and have at least one more element for the loop to continue.

State: **`val` is the new incremented value, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
