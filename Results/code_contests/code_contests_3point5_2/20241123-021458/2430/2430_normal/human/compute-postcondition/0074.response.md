Output State: **After the loop executes, the values of `val`, `ind`, `res`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The loop checks each element in `res` and if the value is greater than 26, it updates the value to `2 * 26 - val`. The loop continues until all elements in `res` have been checked. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute.**
