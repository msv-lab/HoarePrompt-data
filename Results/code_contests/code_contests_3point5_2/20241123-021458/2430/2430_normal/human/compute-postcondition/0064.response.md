Postcondition: ***After the if condition is met, the program variables are updated as follows: `val` is incremented, `ind` retains its current value, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, elements satisfying `res[sosed] == 0` are appended to the `queue`. The loop will continue to iterate as long as `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, and `max(res)` is greater than `HM`***
