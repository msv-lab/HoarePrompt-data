Postcondition: ***After not entering the if condition and executing the else block, `val`, `ind`, `res` and `queue` remain unchanged. The loop will continue to iterate through `nodes[ind]`, checking if `res[sosed] == 0` and appending `[sosed, val]` to the `queue` if the condition is met. The loop will not break unless `val` becomes greater than `HM`, or if `nodes[ind]` is empty or the elements in `nodes[ind]` do not satisfy the condition `res[sosed] == 0`.***
