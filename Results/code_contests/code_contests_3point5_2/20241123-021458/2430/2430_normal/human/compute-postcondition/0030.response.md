According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in nodes[ind] list and the conditions specified. 

For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. `val` must be less than or equal to `HM`.
2. `res[sosed]` must be equal to 0.
3. The elements in `nodes[ind]` must meet the condition `res[sosed] == 0`.
4. `ind` must be assigned the value of `cur[0]` at the end.
5. `res[ind]` must be assigned the new value of `val` at the end.

State: **After the if statement, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, elements in `nodes[ind]` list meet the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `res[ind]` is assigned the new value of `val`.**
