Example Answer:
The value `val` is assigned the value of the second element of the `cur` list. The previous value of `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur`.
Output State: **HM is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the `queue`, `val` is the second element of `cur`**
