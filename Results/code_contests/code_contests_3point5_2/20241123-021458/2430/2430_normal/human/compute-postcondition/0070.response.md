Example Answer:
`val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`, where `ind` is the incremented index. Since the initial state mentions that elements in `nodes[ind]` satisfy `res[sosed] == 0`, we can assume that `res[ind]` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `val` is 0. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`val` is 0, `queue` is empty, elements in `nodes[ind]` satisfy `res[sosed] == 0`, `ind` is incremented by 1**
