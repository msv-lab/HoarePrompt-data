According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `sosed`, `ind`, `res`, `val`, and `nodes`. At the end of the last iteration, `HM` is 51, `cur` is the value popped from the queue, `val` is the second element of `cur` incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the first element of `cur`, the element at index `ind` in the list `res` is updated with the new value of `val`, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `nodes[ind]` has at least one element, the conditions inside the loop are satisfied for the next iteration to occur, `res[sosed]` does not equal 0, and if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `ind` should be updated to the next value to iterate through `nodes`.
- If `sosed` was initially 0 in `res`, then the state should be adjusted to include `[sosed, val]` appended to the queue.

State: **HM is 51, cur is the value popped from the queue, val is the second element of cur incremented by 1, ind is updated to the next value to iterate through nodes, the element at index ind in the list res is updated with the new value of val, val is less than or equal to HM, nodes[ind] has at least one element, the conditions inside the loop are satisfied for the next iteration to occur, res[sosed] does not equal 0, and if res[sosed] was initially 0, then [sosed, val] is appended to the queue.**
