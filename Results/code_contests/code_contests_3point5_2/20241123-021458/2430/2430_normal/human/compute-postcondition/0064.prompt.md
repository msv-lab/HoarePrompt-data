You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is lower than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Output State: 
After the loop executes, the variables maintain their initial values unless the condition `val > HM` is met, in which case the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to iterate through the elements in `nodes[ind]`, checking if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 and appending `[sosed, val]` to the `queue` if the condition is satisfied. If `nodes[ind]` is an empty list or the elements in `nodes[ind]` do not meet the condition `res[sosed] == 0`, the loop does not execute further, and the variables retain their initial values. All edge cases, including boundary values, are handled within these conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `val` is updated, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, elements satisfying `res[sosed] == 0` are appended to the `queue`. The loop will not execute if `val` is greater than `HM` after the if statement, or if `nodes[ind]` is empty or the elements do not meet the condition `res[sosed] == 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `val` is further incremented, `ind` retains the value of `cur[0]`, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, if `res[sosed]` was initially 0, a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. The loop will not execute if `val` is greater than `HM` after the if statement, or if `nodes[ind]` is empty or the elements do not meet the condition `res[sosed] == 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `val` continues to increment, `ind` remains the same, `res[ind]` is updated with the new value of `val`, `nodes[ind]` still has at least one more element, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the loop breaks. If `nodes[ind]` is empty or `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no changes occur to the existing variables.
if condition:
```
if (max(res) > HM):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
