The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. The `queue` parameter represents a queue data structure, `n` is an integer representing the number of cities in Tree Land, and `nodes` represents the nodes in the tree. The function operates based on the precondition that `n` is an integer representing the number of cities in Tree Land, and the input consists of `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` representing an undirected road between cities `a` and `b`. The graph is guaranteed to be a tree.

The program's output state is such that if the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the program returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, the loop iterates through each element in `res`, updating values greater than 26 to `2 * 26 - val`. After the loop executes, the variables maintain their initial values unless the condition `val > HM` is met, in which case the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to iterate through the elements in `res`, updating values greater than 26. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute further, and the variables retain their initial values. All edge cases, including boundary values, are handled within these conditions.

The function handles edge cases and updates values in `res` based on certain conditions. If the maximum value in `res` is greater than `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'.**
