The function `func_1` processes a tree-like data structure represented by the parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. It iterates through the elements in the `queue`, updating the `res` list based on specific conditions. If the maximum value in `res` exceeds a certain threshold `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Additionally, it updates values in `res` greater than 26 to `2 * 26 - val`. The function accounts for edge cases where `res` is empty, and it breaks the loop when a certain condition is met.
