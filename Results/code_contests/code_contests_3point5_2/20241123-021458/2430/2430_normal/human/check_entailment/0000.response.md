Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input and constructs the tree-like data structure.
- The `func_1` function processes the tree structure and assigns ranks to each city's officer according to the given rules.
- The function ensures that for any two cities with officers of the same rank, there exists a city on the path between them with a higher-ranked officer.
- The function also handles the case where it is impossible to assign ranks according to the rules and returns "Impossible!" in such cases.
- The output format is as expected, with each city assigned a rank character from 'A' to 'Z'.
