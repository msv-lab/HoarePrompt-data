Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first reads the input which consists of the number of cities and the edges connecting them.
2. It then initializes a list of nodes connected to each city and a queue to process the cities.
3. The function `func_1` assigns ranks to each city based on the given constraints and returns the ranks as characters.
4. The program then prints the ranks of officers for each city.
5. The program correctly assigns ranks to each city such that the condition mentioned in the problem description is satisfied.
6. The logic of assigning ranks and checking if the solution is possible is implemented correctly based on the problem requirements.
7. The program works as expected for the given problem description and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
