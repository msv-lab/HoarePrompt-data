Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not restore suitable positive integer numbers x and y that would yield the same list of divisors. The logic in the program is incorrect and does not adhere to the problem description. It does not handle the case where there are two occurrences of the same divisor in the input list, leading to incorrect output. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6], the program may output incorrect values for x and y. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.
