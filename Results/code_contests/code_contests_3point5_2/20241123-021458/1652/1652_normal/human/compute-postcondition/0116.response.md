According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in list_divisors starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain unchanged, list_divisors has at least 3 elements, and the loop starts from the 3rd element of list_divisors. For the loop to execute one more time, the list_divisors must have at least 4 elements. No other states need adjustment.
