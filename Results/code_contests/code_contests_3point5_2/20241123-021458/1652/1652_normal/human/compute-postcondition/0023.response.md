Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of list_divisors. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b` and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. If `a` was initially greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. In all cases, `a`, `b` are rearranged such that `a` is less than or equal to `b`, with `d` remaining the third element in list_divisors and `a`, `b` retaining their original values if not explicitly updated. List_divisors has at least 3 elements.***
