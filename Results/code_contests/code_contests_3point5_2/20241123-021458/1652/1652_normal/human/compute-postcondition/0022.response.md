Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `d` are assigned values from elements of list_divisors. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. `b` retains its original value, list_divisors has at least 3 elements, and `d` remains the third element in list_divisors and is strictly less than `b`.***
