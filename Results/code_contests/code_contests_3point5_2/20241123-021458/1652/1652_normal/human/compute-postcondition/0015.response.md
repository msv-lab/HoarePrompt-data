Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `d` are assigned values from list_divisors where list_divisors has at least 3 elements and the third element is greater than or equal to the first element. If d % b == 0, then b is updated to the value of d. If d % a == 0, then a is updated to the value of d. In all cases, a, b, and d are assigned valid values from list_divisors after the execution of the if else block.***
