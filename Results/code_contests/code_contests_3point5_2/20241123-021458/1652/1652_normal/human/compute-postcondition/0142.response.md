Output State: **If idx is not 0 and there is input from sys.stdin, then the loop processes the input by mapping it to integers, updating the values of a and b based on specific conditions, and printing the final pair (a, b) on the standard output. The values of n, d_i, nb_test remain unchanged. If idx is 0 or there is no input from sys.stdin, the loop does not execute and no output is generated.**
