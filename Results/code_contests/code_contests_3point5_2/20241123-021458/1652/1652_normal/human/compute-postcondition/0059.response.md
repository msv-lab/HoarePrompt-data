Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is divisible by `a`, and the values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, and the value of `d` is divisible by `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, and the value of `d` is divisible by `a`**
