According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `list_divisors` starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, it is known that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `list_divisors` should be accessible. 
Since the loop is iterating over `list_divisors[2:]`, the next element in the list that needs to be accessible is the fourth element. To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `idx` should be incremented by 1
- No changes are required for `n`, `d_i`, or `nb_test`
- The values of `a` and `b` should be updated based on the conditions mentioned in the task description
State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, the values of a and b are updated based on the conditions, and list_divisors has at least 3 elements**
