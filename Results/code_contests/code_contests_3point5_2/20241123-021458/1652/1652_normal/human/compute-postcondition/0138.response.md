Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints the values of variables `a` and `b`. The if-else block described manipulates the values of `a` and `b` based on the conditions mentioned. Since all variables retain their initial values and relationships after the execution of the if-else block, the output state remains the same as the initial state, which is the values of `a` and `b` before the if-else block is executed.
Output State: **Initial State: variables retain their initial values and relationships**
