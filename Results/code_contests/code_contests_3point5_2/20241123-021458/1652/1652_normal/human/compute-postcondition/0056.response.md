Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, where `d` is a variable. The value of `d` is unknown, but it is required to be divisible by `b`. Therefore, the value of `b` is the same as `d`, and `d` must be divisible by `b`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, and the value of `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `d`**
