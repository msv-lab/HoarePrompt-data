Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are derived from elements of `list_divisors`, so their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`**
