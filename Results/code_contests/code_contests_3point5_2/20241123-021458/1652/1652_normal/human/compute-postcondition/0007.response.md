According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in list_divisors starting from the third element. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`a` is assigned the value of the second element in list_divisors, `b` is assigned the value of the first element in list_divisors, list_divisors has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element in list_divisors**
