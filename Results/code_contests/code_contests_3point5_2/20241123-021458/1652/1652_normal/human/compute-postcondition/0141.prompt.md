You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`. After the execution of the program fragment, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions within the loop. If `idx` is not 0, `list_divisors` is mapped to integers, and `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements of `list_divisors`. Then, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. Subsequently, for each element `d` in the remaining `list_divisors`, if `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, otherwise `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. The values of `a` and `b` are then swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but less than `b`, `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. Finally, the output is printed as the pair `(a, b)` on the standard output.
```
for line in sys.stdin:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
