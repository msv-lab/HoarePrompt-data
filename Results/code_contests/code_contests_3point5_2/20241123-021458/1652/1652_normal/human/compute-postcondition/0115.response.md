Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain unchanged, list_divisors has at least 3 elements, and the loop starts from the 3rd element of list_divisors. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a` but divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than `b` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`.***
