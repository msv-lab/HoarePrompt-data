Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of the list `list_divisors` respectively. Since the specific values of `list_divisors` are not provided, the values of `a` and `b` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and `a`, `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and `a`, `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`**
