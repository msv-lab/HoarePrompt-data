Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of list_divisors with at least 4 elements, with `d` being the fifth element. If `d >= b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d >= b` and `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Following this, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is not greater than or equal to `b`, but is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. In all other cases, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `d`.***
