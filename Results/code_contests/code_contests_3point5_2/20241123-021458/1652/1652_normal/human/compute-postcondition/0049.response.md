According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there is input available from the standard input. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `a`, `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`. To execute the loop one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input availability from the standard input.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `a`, `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`, input available from standard input**
