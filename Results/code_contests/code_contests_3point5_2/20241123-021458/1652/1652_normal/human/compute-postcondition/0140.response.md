Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`. After the execution of the program fragment, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions within the loop. If `idx` is not 0, `list_divisors` is mapped to integers, and `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements of `list_divisors`. Then, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. Subsequently, for each element `d` in the remaining `list_divisors`, if `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, otherwise `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. The values of `a` and `b` are then swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but less than `b`, `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. Finally, the output is printed as the pair `(a, b)` on the standard output.**
