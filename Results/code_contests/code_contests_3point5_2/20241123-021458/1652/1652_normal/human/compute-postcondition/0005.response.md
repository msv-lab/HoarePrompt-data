Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the first element in list_divisors, which is list_divisors[0]. Similarly, `b` is assigned the value of the second element in list_divisors, which is list_divisors[1]. Therefore, after execution, the values of `a` and `b` are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of the first element in list_divisors, `b` is assigned the value of the second element in list_divisors**
