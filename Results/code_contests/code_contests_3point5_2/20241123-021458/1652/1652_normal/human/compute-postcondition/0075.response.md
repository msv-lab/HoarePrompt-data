Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain as they are. The initial values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the output state will depend on those initial values.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of `a` and `b`, they are either swapped or remain the same**
