Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, `a`, `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`. The program fragment executes the if statement for each element in `list_divisors`. If `d >= b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d >= b` and `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. If `d` is not greater than or equal to `b`, but is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If the loop does not execute, `a` and `b` retain their values from the previous iteration. The code then prints the values of `a` and `b` using `sys.stdout.write()`.***
