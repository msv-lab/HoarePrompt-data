Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, if `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to the value of `d`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. `b` remains unchanged or swapped based on conditions. The list_divisors has at least 5 elements and the loop starts from the 4th element of list_divisors.***
