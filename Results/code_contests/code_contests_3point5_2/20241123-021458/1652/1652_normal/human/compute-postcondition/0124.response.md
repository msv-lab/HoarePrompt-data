Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` is assigned the value of `d` if `d >= a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, `b` is either swapped or remain unchanged, list_divisors has at least 4 elements, and the loop starts from the 3rd element of list_divisors.***
