Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` is now assigned the value of `d`, `b` is now assigned the previous value of `a`, list_divisors has at least 3 elements, and the loop starts from the 3rd element of list_divisors, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a**
