According to the code, the loop reads input from `sys.stdin`. Since `sys.stdin` is a standard input stream, the loop will execute as long as there is input available. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, there is input available in `sys.stdin`**
