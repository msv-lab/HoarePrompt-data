Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes the input to determine the values of `a` and `b` based on specific conditions, and prints the final pair (a, b) on the standard output. The function operates differently based on whether `idx` is 0 or not, and it handles constraints related to `n` and `d_i` as specified. The exact processing details for the input data are not explicitly stated in the annotations.**
