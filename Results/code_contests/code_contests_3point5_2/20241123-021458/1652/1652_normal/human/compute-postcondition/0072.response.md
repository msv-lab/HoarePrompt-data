Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `d`, but the initial state of `d` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, the values of a and b are updated based on the conditions, and list_divisors has at least 3 elements**
