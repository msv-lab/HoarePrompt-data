According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. So, the adjustment needed for the loop to execute is that `list_divisors` should have at least 3 elements. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements**
