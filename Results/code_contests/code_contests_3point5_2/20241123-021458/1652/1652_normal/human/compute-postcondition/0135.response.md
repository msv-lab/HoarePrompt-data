Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain unchanged based on the conditions, list_divisors has at least 5 elements, the loop starts from the 4th element of list_divisors. If `d % b == 0`, `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d % a == 0`, `a` is updated to the value of `d`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. `b` remains unchanged or swapped based on conditions. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, else they remain unchanged. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is updated to the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. All variables retain their initial values and relationships after the execution of the if else block, handling all possible edge cases.***
