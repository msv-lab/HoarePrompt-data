According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the list_divisors starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, a and b are integers. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the index of the next divisor in the list_divisors should be within the bounds of the list. Since the loop starts from the third element, the index should be less than the total number of divisors in the list. Therefore, idx needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 3, a and b are integers**
