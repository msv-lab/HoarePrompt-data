Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, a and b are integers. After the if statement executes, if d is greater than or equal to a and divisible by a, then a is updated to d. If d is greater than or equal to b and divisible by b, b is updated to d. If a is greater than b, a and b are swapped. Otherwise, a and b remain unchanged. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases related to the program state after the execution of the if statement.***
