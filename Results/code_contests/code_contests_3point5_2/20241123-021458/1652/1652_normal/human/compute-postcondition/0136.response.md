According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements remaining in the list_divisors starting from the 4th element. At the end of the last iteration, the variables have the following values: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain unchanged based on the conditions, list_divisors has at least 5 elements. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `idx` should be incremented by 1.
- `d` should be assigned the next element in the list_divisors.
- `a` and `b` should be updated based on the conditions specified in the code block.
- All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, updated values of `a` and `b` based on conditions, list_divisors has at least 5 elements**
