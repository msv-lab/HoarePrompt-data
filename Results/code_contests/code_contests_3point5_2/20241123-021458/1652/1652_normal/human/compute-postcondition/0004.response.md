Example Answer:
The `list_divisors` variable is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input line by spaces. The values of `d_i` are now stored in `list_divisors`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is not equal to 0, list_divisors contains the integer values of d_i.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is not equal to 0, list_divisors contains the integer values of d_i**
