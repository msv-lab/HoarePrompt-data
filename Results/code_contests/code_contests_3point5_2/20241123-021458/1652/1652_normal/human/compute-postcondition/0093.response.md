Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`. After the execution of the program fragment, `a` and `b` will hold values based on the conditions within the loop. If there exist elements `d` in `list_divisors` such that `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` will be updated to the largest such `d`. If no such `d` exists, then `b` will remain unchanged. If there exist elements `d` in `list_divisors` such that `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` will be updated to the largest such `d`. If no such `d` exists, then `a` will remain unchanged. If there exist elements `d` in `list_divisors` such that `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` will be updated to the largest such `d`. If no such `d` exists, then `a` will remain unchanged. Additionally, after the loop, `a` and `b` will be swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. The output will be written to the standard output as the tuple (a, b).***
