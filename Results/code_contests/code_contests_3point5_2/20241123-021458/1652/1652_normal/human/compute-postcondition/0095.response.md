According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from `sys.stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`, `a` and `b` will hold values based on the conditions within the loop as described. Since the loop is dependent on input from `sys.stdin`, no specific states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`, `a` and `b` will hold values based on the conditions within the loop as described**
