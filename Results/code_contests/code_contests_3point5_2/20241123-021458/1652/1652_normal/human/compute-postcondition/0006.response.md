Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. After execution, the value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b` and vice versa. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned the value of the second element in list_divisors, `b` is assigned the value of the first element in list_divisors.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of the second element in list_divisors, `b` is assigned the value of the first element in list_divisors**
