Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, b and a are swapped, list_divisors has at least 3 elements, the loop starts from the 3rd element of list_divisors, and d is greater than or equal to a. If d is divisible by a, then a is updated to the value of d. If d is not divisible by a but divisible by b, then b is updated to the value of d.**
