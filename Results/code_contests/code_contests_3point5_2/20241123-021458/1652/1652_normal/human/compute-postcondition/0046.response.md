Output State: **`a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`, where `d` is the fifth element in the list. If `d >= b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d >= b` and `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. If `d` is not greater than or equal to `b`, but is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If the loop does not execute, `a` and `b` retain their values from the previous iteration. The code then prints the values of `a` and `b` using `sys.stdout.write()`.**
