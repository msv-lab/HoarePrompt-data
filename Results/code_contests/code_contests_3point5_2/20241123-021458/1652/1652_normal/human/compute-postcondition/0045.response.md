Output State: 
- `a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`, where `d` is the third element in the list.
- If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`.
- If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`.
- If `a` was initially greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped.
- If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`.
- The values of `a` and `b` are rearranged such that `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
- The loop will not execute if `list_divisors` has fewer than 3 elements.
- If the loop does not execute, `a` retains its initial value from the second element in `list_divisors`, and `b` retains its initial value from the first element in `list_divisors`.

Output State: 
- `a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`, where `d` is the fourth element in the list.
- If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`.
- If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`.
- If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped.
- If the loop does not execute, `a` and `b` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: 
- `a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`, where `d` is the fifth element in the list.
- If `d >= b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`.
- If `d >= b` and `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`.
- If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped.
- If `d` is not greater than or equal to `b`, but is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`.
- If the loop does not execute, `a` and `b` retain their values from the previous iteration.
