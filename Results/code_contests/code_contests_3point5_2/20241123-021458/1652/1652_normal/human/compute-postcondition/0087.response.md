Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, a and b are integers. After the if statement executes, if d is divisible by a, then a is updated to d. Otherwise, a remains unchanged. In all cases, b remains unchanged. Additionally, if a is greater than b, a and b are swapped.***
