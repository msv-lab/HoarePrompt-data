According to the code fragment, the loop will execute as long as there is input from the standard input. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the values of `n`, `d_i`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` need to be adjusted based on the input received from the standard input. Additionally, the values of `a` and `b` need to be updated according to the conditions within the loop body.

State: **Adjust `n`, `d_i`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `list_divisors`, `a`, and `b` based on the next input from the standard input**.
