Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are derived from elements of `list_divisors`, the specific values of `a` and `b` are not known. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped based on the condition.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped based on the condition**
