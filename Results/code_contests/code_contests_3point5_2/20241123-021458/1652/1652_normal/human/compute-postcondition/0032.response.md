Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of list_divisors with at least 4 elements, with `d` being the fourth element. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the values of `a`, `b`, and `d` after the execution of the if statement.***
