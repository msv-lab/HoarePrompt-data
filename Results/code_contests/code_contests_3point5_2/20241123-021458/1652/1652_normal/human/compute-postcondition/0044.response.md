According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements left in the list_divisors after the current element being processed. At the end of the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of list_divisors with at least 4 elements, with `d` being the fifth element.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Check if there are more elements in the list_divisors after the current element.
- If `d >= b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, update `b` to the value of `d`.
- If `d >= b` and `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, update `a` to the value of `d`.
- Swap `a` and `b` if `a` is greater than `b`.
- If `d` is not greater than or equal to `b`, but is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, update `a` to the value of `d`.

No other changes need to be made if the loop does not continue.

State: **`a`, `b`, `d` are integers derived from elements of list_divisors with at least 4 elements, with `d` being the sixth element (next element in the list_divisors after the current iteration)**.
