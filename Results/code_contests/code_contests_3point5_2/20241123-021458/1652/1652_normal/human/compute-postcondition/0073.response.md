Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, list_divisors has at least 3 elements. If d is divisible by a, then a is updated to be equal to d. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of a and b.***
