Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, the values of a and b are updated based on the conditions, and list_divisors has at least 3 elements. If d is divisible by a, then a is updated to the value of d. In all other cases, a remains unchanged.***
