Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, d_i are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, nb_test is 0, idx is 2, a, b are integers. Depending on the initial values of a and b, if d is greater than or equal to b and divisible by b, b is updated to d. If d is greater than or equal to b and divisible by a, a is updated to d. Then, a and b are swapped if a is greater than b. If d is greater than or equal to a and divisible by a, a is updated to d. In all other cases, a remains unchanged.***
