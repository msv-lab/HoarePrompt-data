Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain unchanged based on the conditions. In the if part, if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. In the elif part, if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged or swapped. The list_divisors has at least 4 elements, and the loop starts from the 3rd element of list_divisors.***
