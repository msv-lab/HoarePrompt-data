The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the constraints provided. The function is expected to handle an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 128, and a list of integers `d_i` where 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n. The function is required to process this input data in a specific manner, but the exact details of the processing are not specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform operations based on the constraints mentioned for `n` and `d_i`, but the specific details of the processing are not provided.
