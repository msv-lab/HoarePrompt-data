Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 128, `d_i` are integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^4 for 1 <= i <= n, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers derived from elements of `list_divisors`, `a` and `b` will hold values based on the conditions within the loop as described**
