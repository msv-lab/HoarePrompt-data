Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of the list `list_divisors` respectively. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the input provided in `list_divisors`. The other variables `nb_test` and `idx` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line, `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of `list_divisors`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line, `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of `list_divisors`**
