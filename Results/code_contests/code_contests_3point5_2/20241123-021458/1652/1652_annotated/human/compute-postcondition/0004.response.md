Example Answer:
The code assigns the result of mapping integers from a split input line to the variable `list_divisors`. The previous values of `nb_test` and `idx` are 0 and an integer not equal to 0 respectively. The mapping operation converts the input line to a list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line**
