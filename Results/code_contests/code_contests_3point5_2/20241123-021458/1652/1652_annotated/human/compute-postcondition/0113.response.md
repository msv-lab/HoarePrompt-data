Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers with updated values, `a` is assigned the value of `d`, `b` is assigned the second integer from `list_divisors`, `d` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`, `d` is strictly less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`.***
