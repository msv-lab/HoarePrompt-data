Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, but the initial state of `d` is not provided, so the value of `a` remains unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values**
