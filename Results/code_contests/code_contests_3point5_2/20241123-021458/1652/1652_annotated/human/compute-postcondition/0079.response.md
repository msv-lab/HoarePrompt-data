Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element. In the if-else block, the following scenarios are covered: If `d >= b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d >= b` and `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Subsequently, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped based on their magnitudes. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Overall, the final state considers all potential updates to `a` and `b` based on the divisibility conditions, ensuring the coherence of the variable values and their relationships.***
