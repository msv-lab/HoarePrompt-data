Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `(d % b) != 0`, and `d` is divisible by `a`. After execution, `a` is equal to `d`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `a` is equal to `d`, and `b` remains the same based on its initial value, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `(d % b) != 0`, and `d` is divisible by `a`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `a` is equal to `d`, `b` remains the same, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `(d % b) != 0`, and `d` is divisible by `a`**
