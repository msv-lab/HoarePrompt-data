Postcondition: ***`nb_test` and `idx` are integers with values of 0. `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers. The loop iterates through the elements of `list_divisors` and updates `a` and `b` based on certain conditions. The final values of `a` and `b` are printed using `sys.stdout.write()`. The values of `a` and `b` are determined by the largest divisors satisfying the given conditions as described in the program fragment.***
