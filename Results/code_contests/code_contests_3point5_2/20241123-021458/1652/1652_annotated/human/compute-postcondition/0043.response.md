Postcondition: ***`nb_test` and `idx` are updated based on the operations, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Furthermore, `a` and `b` are adjusted based on the conditions and potentially swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. In the else part, after the execution of the if statement, `nb_test` and `idx` are updated based on the operations. `list_divisors` still has at least 5 elements. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is set to `d`. Moreover, if `d` is greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are potentially swapped to maintain the program's state. All possible edge cases and conditions are considered to ensure the integrity of the variables and their relationships after the execution of the if else block.***
