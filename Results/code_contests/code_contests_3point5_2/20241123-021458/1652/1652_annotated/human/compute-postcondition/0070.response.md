According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to move to the next element in `list_divisors`. Therefore, `d` needs to be the next element after the last processed element in `list_divisors`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element**
