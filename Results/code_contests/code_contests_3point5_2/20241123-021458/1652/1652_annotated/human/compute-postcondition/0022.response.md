Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` is reassigned to the value of `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`, `b` remains unchanged, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, `d` is less than `b`, and the third element `d` in `list_divisors` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
