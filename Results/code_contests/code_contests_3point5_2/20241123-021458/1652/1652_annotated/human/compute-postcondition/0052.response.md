Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain the same. The previous values of `a` and `b` are the first and second elements of `list_divisors` respectively. Therefore, after execution, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values**
