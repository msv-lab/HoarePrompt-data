Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d % a == 0` and `(d % b) != 0`, then `a` is updated to `d` while `b` remains the same. In all cases, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
