Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. Since `a` and `b` are obtained from `list_divisors`, the initial values are the first and second elements of the list. Therefore, after execution, the new values of `a` and `b` are determined based on their initial values. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from the input line, `a` and `b` are reassigned based on their initial values**
