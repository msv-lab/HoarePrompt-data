Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` are reassigned based on the conditions. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all cases, the third element `d` in `list_divisors` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to `b`.***
