Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values, `b` is equal to `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values, `b` is equal to `d`**
