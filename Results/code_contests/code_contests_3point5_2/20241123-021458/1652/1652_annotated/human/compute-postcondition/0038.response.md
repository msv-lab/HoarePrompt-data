Postcondition: ***`nb_test` and `idx` are updated based on the operations, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Additionally, `a` and `b` are adjusted based on the conditions and potentially swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.***
