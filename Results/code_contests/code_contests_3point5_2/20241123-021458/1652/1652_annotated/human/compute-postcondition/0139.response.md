Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers. After the execution of the program fragment, the integers `a` and `b` are determined based on the values in `list_divisors`. The program outputs `a` and `b` to the standard output. The values of `a` and `b` are updated according to the conditions specified in the code, with `a` and `b` being reassigned based on the divisibility among the divisors in the list. The final values of `a` and `b` are then written to the standard output. Ensure that the postcondition retains the initial values of `nb_test` and `idx`, and the properties of `list_divisors` after the code execution.***
