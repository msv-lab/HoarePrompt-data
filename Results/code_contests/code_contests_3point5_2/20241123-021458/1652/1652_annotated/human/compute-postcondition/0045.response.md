Output State: **`nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged, `list_divisors` has a minimum of 3 elements, `a` and `b` are reassigned based on the conditions of the loop. If `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b` and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `list_divisors` has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
