Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is updated based on the operations, `idx` is updated based on the operations, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `a` is equal to `d` if `d % a == 0`, potentially swapped with `b` if `d` is greater than `b`. The program state ensures that all conditions are met after the execution of the if statement.***
