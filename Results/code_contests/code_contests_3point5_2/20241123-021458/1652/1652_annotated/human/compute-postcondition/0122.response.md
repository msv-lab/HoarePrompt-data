Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values, and `a` is dependent on the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values, and `a` is dependent on the value of `d`**
