Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and the initial conditions state that `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`. Since `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` and `d` are essentially the same value. Therefore, after execution, `a` and `d` will have the same value. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `a` is equal to `d`, and `b` may be swapped or remain the same based on their initial values, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`**
