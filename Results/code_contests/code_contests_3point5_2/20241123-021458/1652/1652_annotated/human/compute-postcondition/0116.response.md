According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more than 2 elements in `list_divisors`. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers with updated values. To execute the loop one more time, the list must contain at least 4 integers with updated values. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values**
