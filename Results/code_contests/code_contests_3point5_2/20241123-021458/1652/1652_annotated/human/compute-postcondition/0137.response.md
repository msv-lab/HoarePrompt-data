Output State: 
If `list_divisors` contains less than 4 integers, the loop will not execute. If the loop does execute, after the loop finishes, `a` will contain the largest integer in `list_divisors` that is divisible by `b`, or if none, the largest integer divisible by `a`. `b` will contain the largest integer in `list_divisors` that is divisible by `b` after the loop finishes. The values of `nb_test` and `idx` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
If the loop executes at least once:
- `a` will be the largest integer in `list_divisors` that is divisible by `b` or if none, the largest integer divisible by `a`.
- `b` will be the largest integer in `list_divisors` that is divisible by `b`.
- `nb_test` will remain 0.
- `idx` will remain 2.
- `list_divisors` will contain at least 3 integers with updated values.
- `a` and `b` will be swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.
