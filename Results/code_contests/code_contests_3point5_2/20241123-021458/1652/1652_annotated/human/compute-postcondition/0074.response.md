Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d % a == 0`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The postcondition reflects the potential scenarios where `b` or `a` may be updated based on the divisibility conditions. The overall state of the program after the if-else block encompasses these possibilities, ensuring the coherence of the variable values and relationships.***
