According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `list_divisors` starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, and `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop is starting from the third element in `list_divisors`, `idx` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The next element `d` in `list_divisors` will be considered, so no changes need to be made to `nb_test`.
- If the conditions for updating `a` and `b` are met during the next iteration, their values might change, but this cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `d`.
  
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values**
