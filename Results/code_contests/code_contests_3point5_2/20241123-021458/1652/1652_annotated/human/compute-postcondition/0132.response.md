Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, but the values of `a` and `d` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values**
