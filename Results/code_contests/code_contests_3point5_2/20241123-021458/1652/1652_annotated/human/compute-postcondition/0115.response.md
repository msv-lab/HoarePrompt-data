Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers with updated values. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `a` or `b`, `a` remains unchanged and `d` is assigned to `b`. After execution, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. In the case where `d` is strictly less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a`, and divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`.***
