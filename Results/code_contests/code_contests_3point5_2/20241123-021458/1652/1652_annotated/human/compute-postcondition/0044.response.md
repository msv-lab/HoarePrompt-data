According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in `list_divisors` after the second index. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` and `idx` are updated, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. Considering the operations performed in the loop, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:

State: **`nb_test` and `idx` are updated based on the operations, `list_divisors` still has at least 5 elements**
