Example Answer:
The values in `list_divisors` are updated by mapping the string elements in `line.strip().split(' ')` to integers. The initial state of `list_divisors` is a list containing at least 4 integers. After executing the code, `list_divisors` is updated with the mapped integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values**
