Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers. The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions in the code and written to standard output. The program handles cases where the elements in `list_divisors` are used to update `a` and `b` based on divisibility conditions. The final values of `a` and `b` are written to the standard output.***
