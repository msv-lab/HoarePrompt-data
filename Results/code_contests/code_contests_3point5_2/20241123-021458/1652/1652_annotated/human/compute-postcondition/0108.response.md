Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers with updated values, `a` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`, `b` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`, `d` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In the case where `d` is not divisible by either `a` or `b`, `a` remains unchanged, and `d` is assigned to `b`. After executing the code snippet, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.**
