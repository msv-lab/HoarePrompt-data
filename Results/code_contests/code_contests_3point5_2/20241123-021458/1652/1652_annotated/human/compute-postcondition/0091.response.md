Output State: **`nb_test` remains 0, `idx` remains 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements. The loop updates variables `a` and `b` based on divisibility conditions within the loop. If `d >= b` and `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d >= b` and `d % b != 0` but `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Subsequently, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d >= a` and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If none of these conditions are met, variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The loop continues iterating through the list of divisors, updating `a` and `b` accordingly. If the loop does not start due to the list containing less than 3 elements, `a` and `b` retain their initial values.**
