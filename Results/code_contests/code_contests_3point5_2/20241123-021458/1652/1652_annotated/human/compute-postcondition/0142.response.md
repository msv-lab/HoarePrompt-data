Output State: **If the input is empty or does not meet the specified conditions, the loop does not execute and `nb_test` remains 0, `idx` is the number of non-empty inputs. For each non-empty input, the loop iterates through the elements, updating `a` and `b` based on certain conditions to find the largest divisors. The final values of `a` and `b` are printed.**
