According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines available in the input from `sys.stdin`. Since the loop reads from stdin, the state of `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` does not affect the loop continuation directly. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers**
