Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If the third element `d` in `list_divisors` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` is reassigned to `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `b` is not affected by the if else block.***
