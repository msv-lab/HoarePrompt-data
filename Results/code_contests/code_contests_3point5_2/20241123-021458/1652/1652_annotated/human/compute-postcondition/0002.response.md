According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input coming from `sys.stdin`. Since we cannot predict the input, we need to make sure that the loop can start. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, and there is input available in `sys.stdin` for the loop to start.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, input available in `sys.stdin`**
