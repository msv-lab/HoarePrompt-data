Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `d`, but the initial values of `d` and other variables are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values, `a` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values, `a` is assigned the value of `d`**
