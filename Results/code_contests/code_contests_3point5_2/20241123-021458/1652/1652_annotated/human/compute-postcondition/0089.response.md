Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. After the execution of the program fragment, the variables `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b` or remain unchanged if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.***
