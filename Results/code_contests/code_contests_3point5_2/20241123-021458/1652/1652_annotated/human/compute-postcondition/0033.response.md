Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. In the if block, if the third element `d` in `list_divisors` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After the if block, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. In the elif block, if the third element `d` in `list_divisors` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, `a` is reassigned to `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `b` remains unaffected.***
