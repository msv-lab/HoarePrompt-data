Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` and `b` are reassigned based on the conditions with the third element `d` in `list_divisors`. If the third element `d` in `list_divisors` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In any case, `nb_test` remains 0, `idx` is still an integer not equal to 0, and the loop terminates after this iteration.**
