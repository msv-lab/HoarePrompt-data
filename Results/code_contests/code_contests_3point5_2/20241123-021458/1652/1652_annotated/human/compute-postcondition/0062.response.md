Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain the same. The values of `a` and `b` are interchanged based on the condition. Therefore, the Output State is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d % a == 0` and `(d % b) != 0`, then `a` is updated to `d` while `b` remains the same. In all cases, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements. If `d % b == 0`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d % a == 0` and `(d % b) != 0`, then `a` is updated to `d` while `b` remains the same. In all cases, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`**
