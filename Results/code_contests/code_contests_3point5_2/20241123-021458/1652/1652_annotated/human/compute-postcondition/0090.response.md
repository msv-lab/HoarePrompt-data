According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `list_divisors`. If there are at least 4 elements in `list_divisors`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element. To execute the loop one more time, `list_divisors` should contain at least 4 elements, and `d` should be the 4th element in the list. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 4 elements, `d` is the 4th element in `list_divisors`**
