Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `d`, but the previous values of `b` and `d` are not given. Therefore, the output state is: `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values, `b` is assigned the value of `d`**
