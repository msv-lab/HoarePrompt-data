Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `nb_test` and `idx` are updated based on the operations. `list_divisors` still has at least 5 elements. If `d >= a`, and `d % a == 0`, then `a` is set to `d`. Additionally, if `d` is greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are potentially swapped to maintain the program's state. All conditions are met to ensure the integrity of the variables and their relationships after the if statement executes.***
