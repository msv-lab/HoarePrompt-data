According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements left in `list_divisors` starting from the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, and `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. `nb_test` remains 0.
2. `idx` remains 1.
3. `list_divisors` should still have at least 3 elements.
4. `d` should now be pointing to the element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element, which means the index should be advanced by 1.

State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element**
