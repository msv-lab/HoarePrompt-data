According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the elements in `list_divisors`. Since `nb_test` and `idx` are integers with values of 0 and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, the loop will execute one more time. The key states that need to be adjusted are `idx` should be increased by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers**
