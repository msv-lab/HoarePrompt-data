According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors` containing at least 3 elements. To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values**
