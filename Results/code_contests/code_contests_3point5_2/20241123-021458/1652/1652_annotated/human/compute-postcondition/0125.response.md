Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but neither condition is met, then `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If none of these conditions are met, no changes are made to the variables `a` and `b`.***
