Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers with updated values, `a` is assigned the value of `d`, `b` is assigned the second integer from `list_divisors`, `d` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors` where `d` is greater than `b` and `(d % b) != 0`, and `d` is divisible by `a`.***
