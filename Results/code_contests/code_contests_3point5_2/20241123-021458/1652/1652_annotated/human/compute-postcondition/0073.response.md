Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element. If `d % a == 0`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The overall state of the program after the if statement executes accounts for the possibility of `a` being updated to the value of `d` based on the condition `d % a == 0`.***
