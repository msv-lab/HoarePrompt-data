According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from `sys.stdin`. Since the loop will execute one more time, the `list_divisors` must contain at least 4 integers (one more than the previous iteration). The values of `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code, so no adjustment is needed for those variables.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers**
