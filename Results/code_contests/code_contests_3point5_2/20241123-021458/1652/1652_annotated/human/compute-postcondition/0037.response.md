Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is updated based on the operations, `idx` is updated based on the operations, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Moreover, `b` is adjusted based on the conditions and potentially swapped with `a` if `a` is greater than `b`.***
