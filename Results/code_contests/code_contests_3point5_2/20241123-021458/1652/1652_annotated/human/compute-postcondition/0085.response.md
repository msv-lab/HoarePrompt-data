Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
