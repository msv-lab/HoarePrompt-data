According to the code, the loop can execute if `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `nb_test` remains 0, `idx` remains an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` needs to have at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` need to be reassigned based on their initial values, and `d` should be the third element in `list_divisors`.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` are reassigned, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`**
