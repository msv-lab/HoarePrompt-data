Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If the third element `d` in `list_divisors` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is reassigned to the value of `d`. In all cases, no changes occur to `b` and the loop terminates after this iteration.***
