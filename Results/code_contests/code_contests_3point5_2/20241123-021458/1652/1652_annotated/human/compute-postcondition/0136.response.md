According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_divisors. If the list contains at least 5 integers, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers with updated values. To execute the loop one more time, the `list_divisors` must contain at least 5 integers. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers with updated values**
