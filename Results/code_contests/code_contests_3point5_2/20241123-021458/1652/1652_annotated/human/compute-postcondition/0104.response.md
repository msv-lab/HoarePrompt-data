Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers with updated values, `a` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`, `b` is assigned the second integer from `list_divisors`, `d` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`. The value of `d` is greater than the value of `b`, and `(d % b) != 0`, and `d` is divisible by `a`***
