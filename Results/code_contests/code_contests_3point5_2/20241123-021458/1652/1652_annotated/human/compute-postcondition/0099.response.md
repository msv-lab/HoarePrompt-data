According to the code, the loop can execute if the list_divisors has at least 3 elements after the second index. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `nb_test` remains 0, `idx` is now 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers with updated values, `a` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`, `b` is assigned the second integer from `list_divisors`, and `d` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`.
State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers with updated values, `a` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`, `b` is assigned the second integer from `list_divisors`, `d` is assigned the third integer from `list_divisors`**
