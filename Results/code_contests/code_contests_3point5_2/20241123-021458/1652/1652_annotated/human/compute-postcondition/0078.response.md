Postcondition: ***`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the next element in `list_divisors` after the last processed element. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. In all other cases, no changes are made to the variables.***
