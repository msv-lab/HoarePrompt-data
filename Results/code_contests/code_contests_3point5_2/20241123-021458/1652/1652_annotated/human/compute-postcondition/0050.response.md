Example Answer: 
The values in `list_divisors` are replaced by integers obtained by mapping the elements of the input `line` after stripping and splitting it. The values in `list_divisors` are now integers. The variables `nb_test` and `idx` remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, `list_divisors` contains mapped integers**
