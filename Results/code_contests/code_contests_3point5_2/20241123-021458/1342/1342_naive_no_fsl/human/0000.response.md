Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always follow the problem description. The program only considers whether the input number is a prime number or not, and outputs 1, 2, or 3 based on that condition. However, the program does not implement the logic required to find the minimum possible number of burles that Mr. Funt has to pay by splitting the income into parts as described in the problem.

For example, if the input is 10, the program will output 3 (which is incorrect) as it should output 2 (splitting into 5 + 5). Hence, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases based on the problem description.
