According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables `n` and `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the square root of `n` plus 100. And since `i` is incremented by 1, it needs to be adjusted accordingly.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `i` should be less than int(n ** 0.5 + 100)**.
