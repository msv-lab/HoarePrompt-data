Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is less than int(n). If n % i equals 0 and n is not equal to i, the program returns False. The postcondition covers all cases where the program returns False based on the conditions specified, ensuring that `n` and `i` meet the necessary criteria for the program to execute correctly.***
