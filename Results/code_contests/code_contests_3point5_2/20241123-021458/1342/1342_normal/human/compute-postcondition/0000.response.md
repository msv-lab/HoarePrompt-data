According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range specified has more than one element. So, in this case, for the loop to execute, n must be greater than or equal to 2. The loop will start from 2 and end at the integer square root of n plus 100. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2**
