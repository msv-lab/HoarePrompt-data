According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is less than int(n). If n % i equals 0 and n is not equal to i, the program returns False. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 2, `i` is less than int(n)**
