The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 2. 

Case 1: If `n` is divisible by any integer `i` such that `2 <= i <= int(n)`, the function returns False.

Case 2: If case 1 is not fulfilled, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` greater than or equal to 2 and return True if `n` is not divisible by any integer `i` such that `2 <= i <= int(n)`. If `n` is divisible by any such integer, it returns False.
