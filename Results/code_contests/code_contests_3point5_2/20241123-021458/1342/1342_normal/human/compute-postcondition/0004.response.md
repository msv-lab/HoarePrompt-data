According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `i < int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` is met. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
