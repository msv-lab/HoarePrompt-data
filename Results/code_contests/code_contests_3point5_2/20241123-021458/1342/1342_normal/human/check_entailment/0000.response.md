Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if the given number `n` is a prime number or not, and then prints the minimum number of burles that Mr. Funt has to pay as tax based on certain conditions.
- The output hints for the functions also align with the code's functionality and do not provide any contradictory information.
- The code handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as when `n = 2`, `n = 27`, and `n = 4`, and produces the correct output in each case.
- Therefore, based on the code, description, and examples provided, the program is correct.
