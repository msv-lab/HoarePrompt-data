The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n`, which is greater than or equal to 2. It iterates through a range of integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus 100. If `n` is divisible by any integer within this range, excluding `n` itself, the function returns False. If `n` is not divisible by any such integer, it returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to check if `n` is a prime number and return True if it is, or False if it is not.
