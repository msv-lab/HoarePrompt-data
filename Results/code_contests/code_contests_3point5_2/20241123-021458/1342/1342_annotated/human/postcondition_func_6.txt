The function func_7 accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) and returns True if n is not divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of n plus 100 (exclusive). If n is divisible by any integer i within the specified range and n is not equal to i, the function returns False. The program always returns True in Case 2.
