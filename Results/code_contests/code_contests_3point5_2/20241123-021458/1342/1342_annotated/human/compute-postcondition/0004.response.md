According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `i` are unknown. However, we can infer that if the function did not return False, then `n` is not divisible by `i` or is equal to `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **Adjust `i` by incrementing it by 1**
