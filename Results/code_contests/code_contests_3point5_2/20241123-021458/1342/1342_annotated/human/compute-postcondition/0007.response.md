According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that it is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**
