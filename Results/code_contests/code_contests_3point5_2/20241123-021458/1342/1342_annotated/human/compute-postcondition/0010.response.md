According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 100. At the end of the last iteration, `i` and `n` are integers. If n % i == 0 and n is not equal to i, the function returns False. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i+1`, `n` are integers**
