The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`. The parameter `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9). If `n` is not divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of `n` plus 100 (exclusive), then the function returns True. If `n` is divisible by any integer `i` within the specified range and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. In all cases, `n` and `i` are integers. Additionally, the program always returns True in Case 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to determine if the input integer `n` is divisible by any integer within a specified range and return True if it is not, and False if it is divisible by another integer within the range but not equal to `n`. The function always returns True in Case 2. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9), returns True if n is not divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of n plus 100 (exclusive), otherwise returns False. Additionally, the program always returns True in Case 2.**
