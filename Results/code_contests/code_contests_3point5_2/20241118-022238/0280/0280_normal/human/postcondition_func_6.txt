The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns a list l containing all the divisors of n. The function iterates over the range from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), checks if n is divisible by i, and appends i to list l if n divided by i equals i. If n divided by i is different from i, both i and the division result are added to l. If n is 0, the list l remains empty. If n is 1, the loop executes once, appending 1 to list l.
