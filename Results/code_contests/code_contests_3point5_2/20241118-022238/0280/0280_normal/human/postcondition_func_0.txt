The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`. After executing the function body, the program returns the result of `n` raised to the power of `(p - 2)` modulo `p`. The function operates under the assumption that `n` and `p` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, p ≤ 100. If the provided constraints are not met, the behavior is not specified.
