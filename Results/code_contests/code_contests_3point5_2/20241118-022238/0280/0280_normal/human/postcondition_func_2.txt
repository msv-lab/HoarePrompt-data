The function func_3 does not accept any parameters. It calls another function func_4, applies the 'int' function to each element in the list returned by func_4, and returns a list of integers. The code does what the annotations describe, converting the elements of the list returned by func_4 to integers and returning a list of integers. However, potential edge cases or missing functionality could involve error handling if func_4 does not return a valid list of strings that can be split or if there are non-integer elements in the list.
