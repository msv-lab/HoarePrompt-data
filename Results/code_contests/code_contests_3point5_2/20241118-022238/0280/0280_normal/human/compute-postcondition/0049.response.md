Output State: **`f` is a list. If `prime[p]` is true for all `p` from 2 to `n-1`, then all those `p` values will be appended to `f`. If `prime[p]` is false for any `p`, then no value is appended to `f`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop doesn't execute and `f` remains an empty list.**
