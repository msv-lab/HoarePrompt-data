Example Answer: 
The value at index `i` in the `prime` list is set to `False`. The value of `i` is `p * p`, where `p` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. This operation updates the state of the `prime` list. There are no changes to the values of `n` or any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: prime is a list containing n+1 elements with the value at index `i` set to False.
Output State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements with the value at index `i` set to False**
