Example Answer:
The value of `p` is appended to the list `f`. The list `f` will now contain the value of `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` contains the value of `p`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `prime[p]` is true.
Output State: **`f` contains the value of `p`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `prime[p]` is true**
