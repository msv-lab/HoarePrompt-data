According to the code, the loop can execute again if the range conditions are met. At the end of the last iteration, `prime[i]` is False, and `i` is `n + p`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next multiple of `p` greater than the current value of `i`, which is `n + p`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `n + 2p` and `prime[i]` should be set to False.
State: **`prime[i]` is False, `i` is `n + 2p`**
