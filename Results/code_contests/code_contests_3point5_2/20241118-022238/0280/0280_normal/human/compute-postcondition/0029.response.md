According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range condition `i < n + 1` is met. At the end of the previous iteration, `p` is the value used to initialize the loop, `n` is the upper limit, and `i` is the current value in the loop. 

To execute one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `n + 1`. Since the loop increments `i` by `p` each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `p * p + p`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements with the value at index `p * p + p` set to True except for the value at index `p * p + p` set to False**
