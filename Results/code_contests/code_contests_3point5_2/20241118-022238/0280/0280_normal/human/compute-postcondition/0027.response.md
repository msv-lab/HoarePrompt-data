According to the code, the loop will execute if the range `range(p * p, n + 1, p)` contains values. At the end of the previous iteration, the value at index `i` in the list `prime` was set to False. For the loop to execute one more time, the value at index `i` needs to be set to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements with the value at index `i` set to True**
