According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`. 
Before the loop starts, prime is a list containing n+1 elements, and prime[p] is True. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to `p * p`.
State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements, prime[p] is True, p * p is less than or equal to n, i is initialized to p * p**
