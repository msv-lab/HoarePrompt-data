Output State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements where some values are True and some are False. If p is less than or equal to 1, no changes are made to the list. If p is greater than 1, the values at indices that are multiples of p starting from p*p are set to False, while all other elements remain unchanged. In all cases, p is incremented by 1 after the execution of the if statement.**
