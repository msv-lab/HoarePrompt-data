According to the code, the loop can execute again if p * p is less than or equal to n. At the end of the last iteration, prime is a list containing n+1 elements and prime[p] was True. To execute the loop one more time, p * p needs to be less than or equal to n. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements, prime[p] is True, p * p is less than or equal to n**
