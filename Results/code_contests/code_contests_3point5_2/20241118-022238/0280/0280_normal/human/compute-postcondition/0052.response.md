Functionality: **The function func_8 accepts an integer n and generates a list f containing all prime numbers from 2 to n-1. It achieves this by initializing a list 'prime' with True values for indices up to n, then marking multiples of each prime number as False. The function then populates the list f with the prime numbers found based on the values in the 'prime' list. If n is less than or equal to 2, f remains an empty list.**
