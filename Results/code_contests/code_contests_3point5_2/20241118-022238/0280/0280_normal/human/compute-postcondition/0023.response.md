Output State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements where some values are True and some are False. After the execution of the if block, for each element i in the range from p * p to n inclusive with intervals of p, prime[i] will be set to False. Initially, prime[p] remains True. If p is such that p * p is greater than n, the loop does not execute. The postcondition ensures that the integrity of the list prime is maintained with the specified changes based on the conditions of the if statement. `p` is incremented by 1.**
