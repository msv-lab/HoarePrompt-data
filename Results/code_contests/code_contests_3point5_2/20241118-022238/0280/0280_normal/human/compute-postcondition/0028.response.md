Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in the list `prime` is set to `False`. The initial state of the list `prime` contains `n+1` elements with the value at index `i` set to `True`. After running the code, the value at index `i` in the list `prime` will be `False`.
Output State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements with the value at index `i` set to True except for the value at index `i` set to False**
