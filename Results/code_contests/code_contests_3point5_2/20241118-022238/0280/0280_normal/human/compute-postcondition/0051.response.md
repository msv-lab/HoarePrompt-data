The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer. After executing the function body, the program returns a list `f`. The contents of `f` depend on the values of `prime[p]` for each `p` from 2 to `n-1`. If all `prime[p]` values are true, then `f` contains all prime numbers from 2 to `n-1`. If any `prime[p]` is false, then `f` remains an empty list. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `f` is also an empty list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and returns a list `f` containing prime numbers from 2 to `n-1` if all `prime[p]` values are true. If any `prime[p]` is false or `n` is less than or equal to 2, `f` remains an empty list.**
