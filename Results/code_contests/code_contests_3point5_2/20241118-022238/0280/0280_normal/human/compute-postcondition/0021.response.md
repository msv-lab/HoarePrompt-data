Output State: **After the loop executes, the prime list will contain n+1 elements with some values set to True and some to False. The loop will set prime[i] to False for all i in the range from p * p to n inclusive at intervals of p. Initially, prime[p] will remain True, and p * p will be less than or equal to n. If p is such that p * p is greater than n, the loop will not execute.**
