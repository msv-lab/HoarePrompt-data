According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `f` is an empty list, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `f` is an empty list and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
