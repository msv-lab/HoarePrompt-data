Example Answer: 
A list `prime` is created with `n+1` elements, where each element is set to `True`. The value of `n` is not given, so we cannot determine the exact size of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `prime` is a list containing n+1 elements, with each element set to True.
Output State: **`prime` is a list containing n+1 elements, with each element set to True**
