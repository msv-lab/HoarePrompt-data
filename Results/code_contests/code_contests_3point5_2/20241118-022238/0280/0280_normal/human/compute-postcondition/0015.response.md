Example Answer:
The value of `prime[i]` is set to `False`. The previous values of `prime` and `i` are not explicitly given, but it is known that `i` was initialized to `p * p`. Therefore, after execution, the value at index `i` in the list `prime` is set to `False`.
Output State: **prime is a list containing n+1 elements with some values set to True and some to False, prime[p] is True, p * p is less than or equal to n, i is initialized to p * p, prime[i] is False**
