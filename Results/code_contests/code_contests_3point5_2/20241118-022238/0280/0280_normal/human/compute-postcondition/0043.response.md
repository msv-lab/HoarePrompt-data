Example Answer: 
If `prime[p+1]` is true, then the value of `p+1` will be appended to the list `f`. The state of `f` will change based on whether `prime[p+1]` is true or false. The integer `n` does not affect this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` will have `p` appended to it if `prime[p+1]` is true.
Output State: **`f` will have `p` appended to it if `prime[p+1]` is true**
