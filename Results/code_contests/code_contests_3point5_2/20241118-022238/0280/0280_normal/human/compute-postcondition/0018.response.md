According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `p`, and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prime[i]` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the previous iteration's end value, which is `n + p`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`prime[i]` is False, `i` is `n + p`**
