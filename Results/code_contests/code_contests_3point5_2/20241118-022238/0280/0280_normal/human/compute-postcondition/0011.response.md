Postcondition: ***`prime` is a list containing n+1 elements. After the if statement executes, if prime[p] is True, then for each index i in the range from p*p to n, inclusive, prime[i] will be set to False if i is not a prime number. If n is less than p*p, the list prime remains unchanged. The variable p retains the value 2 after the execution of the if statement.***
