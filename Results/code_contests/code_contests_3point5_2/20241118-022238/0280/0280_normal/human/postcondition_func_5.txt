The function func_6 accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. If the minimum value between the absolute value of `x` and `y` is 0, it returns the maximum value between the absolute value of `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are non-zero, the function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the GCD, which is stored in `x` after the loop finishes.
