The function func_2() does not accept any parameters. It returns a map object containing integers after splitting the output of func_4() and converting them to integers. It is important to note that the annotation mentions using func_4(), but the actual function call is func_4().split(), which splits the output of func_4() into a list of strings before converting them to integers.
