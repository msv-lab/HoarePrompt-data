The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It processes the input provided through `kwargs`. It iterates through the elements in `args` and writes them to the `file` with a separator `sep`. If the `end` keyword argument is present in `kwargs`, it writes the specified ending character, defaulting to a newline. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the `file`. The function does not have a specific return value.
