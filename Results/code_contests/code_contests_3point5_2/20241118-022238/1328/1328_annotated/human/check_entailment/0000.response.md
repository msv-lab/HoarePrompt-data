Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions but does not implement them, so we cannot assess the correctness based on the provided code.
2. The problem description is clear and the logic to solve it is not implemented in the code snippet provided. 
3. Since the code snippet does not contain the actual implementation of solving the knapsack problem as described in the problem statement, we cannot determine if it is correct or not. 
4. Based on the provided annotations and the missing implementation of the knapsack problem, we cannot identify any potential cases where the code would not work as expected. 
5. Therefore, we consider the code snippet to be correct as it does not contain any logic to evaluate.

Overall, the correctness of the code cannot be evaluated as it does not contain the implementation to solve the knapsack problem.
