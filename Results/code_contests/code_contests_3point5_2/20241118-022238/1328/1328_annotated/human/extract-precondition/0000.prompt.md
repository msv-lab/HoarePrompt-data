You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You have a knapsack with the capacity of W. There are also n items, the i-th one has weight w_i. 

You want to put some of these items into the knapsack in such a way that their total weight C is at least half of its size, but (obviously) does not exceed it. Formally, C should satisfy: ⌈ W/2⌉ ≤ C ≤ W. 

Output the list of items you will put into the knapsack or determine that fulfilling the conditions is impossible. 

If there are several possible lists of items satisfying the conditions, you can output any. Note that you don't have to maximize the sum of weights of items in the knapsack.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains integers n and W (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 1≤ W ≤ 10^{18}). 

The second line of each test case contains n integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_n (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9) — weights of the items.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200 000.

Output

For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single integer -1. 

If there exists a solution consisting of m items, print m in the first line of the output and m integers j_1, j_2, ..., j_m (1 ≤ j_i ≤ n, all j_i are distinct) in the second line of the output — indices of the items you would like to pack into the knapsack.

If there are several possible lists of items satisfying the conditions, you can output any. Note that you don't have to maximize the sum of weights items in the knapsack.

Example

Input


3
1 3
3
6 2
19 8 19 69 9 4
7 12
1 1 1 17 1 1 1


Output


1
1
-1
6
1 2 3 5 6 7

Note

In the first test case, you can take the item of weight 3 and fill the knapsack just right.

In the second test case, all the items are larger than the knapsack's capacity. Therefore, the answer is -1.

In the third test case, you fill the knapsack exactly in half.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
import math
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```
