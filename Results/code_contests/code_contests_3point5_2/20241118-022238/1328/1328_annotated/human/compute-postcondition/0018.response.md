Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The state of `args` and `x` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element, `x` is not the last element in the list.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element, `x` is not the last element in the list**
