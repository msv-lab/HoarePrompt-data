Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`, so `at_start` is now `True`. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200,000, `W` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `W` <= 10^18, `w_i` are positive integers representing the weights of the items such that 1 <= `w_i` <= 10^9, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True**
