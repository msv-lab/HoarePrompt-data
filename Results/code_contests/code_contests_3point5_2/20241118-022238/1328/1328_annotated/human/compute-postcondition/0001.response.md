Example Answer:
The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values from the `kwargs` dictionary using the `pop` method with default values of `' '` and `sys.stdout` respectively. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200,000, `W` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `W` <= 10^18, `w_i` are positive integers representing the weights of the items such that 1 <= `w_i` <= 10^9, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200,000, `W` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `W` <= 10^18, `w_i` are positive integers representing the weights of the items such that 1 <= `w_i` <= 10^9, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`**
