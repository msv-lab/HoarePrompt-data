According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `args`. If there are more elements in `args`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `args` must have at least one more element. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element**
