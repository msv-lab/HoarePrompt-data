Example Answer:
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `at_start` remains False, and the elements in `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element**
