Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of items and the capacity of the knapsack.
3. It then reads the weights of the items and checks if there is an item whose weight falls within the required range of ⌈ W/2⌉ ≤ C ≤ W. If such an item is found, it prints the index of that item.
4. If no single item satisfies the condition, it then tries to find a combination of items whose total weight falls within the required range. It uses a greedy approach to select items until the total weight is at least half of the knapsack capacity but does not exceed the capacity. If such a combination is found, it prints the number of items selected and their indices.
5. If no combination of items satisfies the condition, it prints -1.
6. The code seems to handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
