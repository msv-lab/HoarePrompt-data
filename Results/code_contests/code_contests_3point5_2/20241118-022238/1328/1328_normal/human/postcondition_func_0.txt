The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is intended to handle a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case should consist of `n`, `W`, and `n` integers `w_i`. The constraints for the parameters are specified. However, the function lacks the implementation to process these test cases effectively and does not return any specific value. There is missing functionality in handling and processing the test cases as described in the annotations.
