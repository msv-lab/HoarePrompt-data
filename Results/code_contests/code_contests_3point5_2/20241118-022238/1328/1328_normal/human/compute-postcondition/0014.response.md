According to the code, the loop execution depends on the elements in the `args` list. If there are more elements in the `args` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers and `at_start` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the `args` list must have more elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has more elements**
