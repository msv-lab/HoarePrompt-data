Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `W` is a positive integer, and `w_i` are positive integers; `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `W` is a positive integer, and `w_i` are positive integers; `at_start` is True**
