Example Answer:
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the `sep` string. The previous values of all variables are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty list, and `x` is the first element in `args`. The `write` method does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element in `args`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element in `args`**
