Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has more elements, `sep` is written to the file.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has more elements, `sep` is written to the file**
