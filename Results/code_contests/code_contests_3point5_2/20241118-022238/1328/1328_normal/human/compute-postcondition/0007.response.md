Example Answer:
The function writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers. If `at_start` is False, the function writes `sep` to the file.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers. If `at_start` is False, the function writes `sep` to the file**.
