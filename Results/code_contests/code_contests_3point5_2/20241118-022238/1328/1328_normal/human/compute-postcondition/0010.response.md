Example Answer:
If `at_start` is False, the function writes `sep` to the file. The variables `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, so their values remain unchanged. The `args` list having more elements does not affect the output state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers**
