Example Answer: 
The `file.write(sep)` function writes the value of `sep` to the file. The variables `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has more elements.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has more elements**
