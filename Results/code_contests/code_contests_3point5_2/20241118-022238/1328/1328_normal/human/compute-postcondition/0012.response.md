Example Answer:
`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The value of `x` is not given in the initial state, so the output state will be dependent on the value of `x` at runtime. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers. If `at_start` is False, the function writes `sep` to the file. The `args` list has more elements after the execution of the if-else block.**
