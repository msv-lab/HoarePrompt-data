Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing each element to a file specified in the `kwargs` dictionary. It separates the elements by the value of `sep` and writes the value specified in `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. If the flag `flush` is True in `kwargs`, the file is flushed after writing. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute.**
