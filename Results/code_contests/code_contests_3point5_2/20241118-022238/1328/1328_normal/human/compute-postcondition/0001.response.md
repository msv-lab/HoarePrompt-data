Example Answer:
The code snippet `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` assigns values to `sep` and `file` based on the keyword arguments passed to the function. Since the initial state does not provide any information about `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **t is a positive integer. For each test case, n is a positive integer, W is a positive integer, and w_i are positive integers.**
