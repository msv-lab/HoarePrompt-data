According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` list. If the list has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers. If `at_start` is False, the function writes `sep` to the file. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `args` list must have more elements. So the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the `args` list.
State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers. If `at_start` is False, the function writes `sep` to the file, `args` list has more elements**
