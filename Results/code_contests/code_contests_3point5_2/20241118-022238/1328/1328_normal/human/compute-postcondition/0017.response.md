Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file. The previous values of the variables are not affected. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has more elements, `sep` is written to the file.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has more elements, `sep` is written to the file**
