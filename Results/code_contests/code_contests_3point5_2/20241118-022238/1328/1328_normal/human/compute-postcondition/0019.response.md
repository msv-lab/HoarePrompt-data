According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `args` list. If there are still more elements in the `args` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has more elements, `sep` is written to the file. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `args` list must have even more elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` list has even more elements, `sep` is written to the file**
