According to the code, the loop can execute if there are arguments `args` provided. Since `args` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we need to ensure that `args` is non-empty. Also, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `args`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `args` should be a non-empty list. Additionally, `x` should be the first element in `args` for the first iteration.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `W` is a positive integer, `w_i` are positive integers, `at_start` is True, `args` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element in `args`**
