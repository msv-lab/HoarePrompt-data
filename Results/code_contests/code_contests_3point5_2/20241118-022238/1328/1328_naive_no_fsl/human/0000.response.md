Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, knapsack capacity, and weights of the items.
2. It correctly handles the cases where an item's weight is already within the specified range and outputs the index of that item.
3. It also handles cases where no single item can meet the requirements and outputs -1.
4. For cases where multiple items need to be selected to meet the requirements, the program correctly calculates the total weight of the selected items and outputs the indices of those items.
5. The program uses appropriate logic to iterate through the items and check if the conditions are met.
6. The program outputs the result in the specified format for each test case.

Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and is correct.
