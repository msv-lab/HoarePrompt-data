Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the trump suit and two cards as input.
- It then extracts the rank and suit of each card.
- It compares the suits and ranks of the two cards based on the rules provided in the problem description.
- If the first card beats the second card, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code logic.
