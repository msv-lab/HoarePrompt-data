Example Answer:
The variable `i` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`s` is a string representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D" or "C"); `s2` is a list containing two strings, each representing a different card with the format "RS" where R is the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A") and S is the suit ("S", "H", "D", "C"); `i` is 0**
