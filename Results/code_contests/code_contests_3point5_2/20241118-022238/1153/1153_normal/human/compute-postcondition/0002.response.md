Example Answer:
The variable `m1` is assigned the string '6789TJQKA'. The variables `s` and `s2` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D" or "C"); `s2` is a list containing two strings, each representing a different card with the format "RS" where R is the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A") and S is the suit ("S", "H", "D", "C").
