According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the list `m1` to iterate over. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states accordingly for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is a string representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D" or "C"), `s2` is a list containing two strings, each representing a different card with the format "RS", `i` is 0, `ts` is the last element in list `m1`, and `r1` is 2.
