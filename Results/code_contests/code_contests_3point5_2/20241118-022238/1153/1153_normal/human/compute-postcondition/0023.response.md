Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D" or "C"), `s2` is a list containing two strings, each representing a different card with the format "RS", `i` is 0, `ts` is the last element in list `m1`, `r1` is 2. If the suit of the second card in `s2` matches `ts`, then `r2` is updated to 0. Otherwise, `r2` remains unchanged.***
