Example Answer:
The value entered by the user is stored in variable `s`. The variable `s` now holds the input value. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D" or "C"); s2 is a list containing two strings, each representing a different card with the format "RS" where R is the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A") and S is the suit ("S", "H", "D", "C").
Output State: **s is a string representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D" or "C"); s2 is a list containing two strings, each representing a different card with the format "RS" where R is the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A") and S is the suit ("S", "H", "D", "C")**
