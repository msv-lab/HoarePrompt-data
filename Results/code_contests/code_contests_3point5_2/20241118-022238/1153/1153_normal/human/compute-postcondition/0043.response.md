Postcondition: ***`m1` is a list. If `m1` is empty, `r2` remains undefined. If `m1` is not empty, after the execution of the if-else block, `r2` will be the index of the element in `m1` that matches the first character of the second element in `s2`, or 0 if no match is found. In addition, if the second character of the first element in `s2` is not equal to the second character of the second element in `s2` and the first character of the first element in `s2` is equal to the first character of `s`, the output is 'YES'. If the second character of the first element in `s2` is equal to the second character of the second element in `s2` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'. The postcondition covers all scenarios including the empty and non-empty `m1`, and the comparison of `r1` and `r2` with respect to the equality of the second characters in `s2`.***
