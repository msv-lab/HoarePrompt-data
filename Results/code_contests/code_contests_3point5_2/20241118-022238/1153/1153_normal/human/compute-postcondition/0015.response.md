Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D" or "C"), `s2` is a list containing two strings, each representing a different card with the format "RS", `i` is 2, `m1` has at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in list `m1`, and `r1` is 2. If the suit of the third card in `m1` matches the suit of the first card in `s2`, `r1` is assigned the value of 2. Otherwise, `r1` remains unchanged at 2.***
