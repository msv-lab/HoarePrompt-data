Output State: **`m1` is a list. If `m1` is not empty, then after the loop executes, `r2` will be the index of the element in `m1` that matches the first character of the second element in `s2`, or 0 if no match is found. If `m1` is empty, `r2` remains undefined. Additionally, the second character of the first element in `s2` is equal to the second character of the second element in `s2` and `r1` is greater than `r2`.**
