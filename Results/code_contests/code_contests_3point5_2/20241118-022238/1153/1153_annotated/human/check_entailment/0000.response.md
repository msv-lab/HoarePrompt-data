Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the rules of the "Durak" card game as described in the problem description. It determines whether the first card beats the second card based on the rank and suit of the cards, considering trumps and non-trump cards. The logic in the code is sound and handles all possible cases correctly. The program compares the ranks and suits of the two cards and prints "YES" if the first card beats the second card, and "NO" otherwise. The code covers all scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
