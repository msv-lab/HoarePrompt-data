The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to compare the suits of two cards represented by the strings in the list `s2` with the trump suit `s`. The function should return the index of the winning card in the list `s2` based on the trump suit and the card rankings. If both cards have the same suit, the higher ranking card wins. If the trump suit is present in one of the cards, it wins regardless of the ranking. If there is a tie or an invalid input, the function should return -1.
