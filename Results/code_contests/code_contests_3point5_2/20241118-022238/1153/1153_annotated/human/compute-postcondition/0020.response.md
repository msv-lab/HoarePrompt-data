According to the code, the loop can execute if `m1` is not empty. For `r1` to be set to the index where the match occurred, `s2` must have a string with a first character equal to the first element of `m1`. If no match occurs, `r1` remains either 0 or the last index before the match. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0.
State: **`m1` is not empty, `s2` has a string with a first character equal to the first element of `m1` for the match to occur, `r1` is set to the index where the match occurred or 0 if no match occurred, `i` is 0**
