Output State: **If `m1` is not empty and `s2` has a string with a first character equal to the first element of `m1`, the loop will iterate through `m1` comparing each element with the first character of the second element of `s2`. `r1` will be set to the index where the match occurred or 0 if no match occurred. `i` will be the total number of iterations. `ts` will be the current element being compared. `r2` will be assigned the value of `i` if the condition is met. If `m1` is empty or `s2` is an empty list, the loop will not execute and `r1` will remain 0.**
