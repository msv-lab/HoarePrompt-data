Example Answer:
`r1` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 3, so after execution, `r1` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s2` is a list of strings, `i` is 3, `m1` is an iterable object with more elements, `ts` is the next element after the current `ts`, `r1` is 3.
Output State: **`s2` is a list of strings, `i` is 3, `m1` is an iterable object with more elements, `ts` is the next element after the current `ts`, `r1` is 3**
