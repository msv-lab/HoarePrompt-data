Postcondition: ***`m1` is not empty and `s2` has a string with a first character equal to the first element of `m1`, the loop iterates through `m1` comparing each element with the first character of the second element of `s2`. `r1` is set to the index where the match occurred or 0 if no match occurred. `i` is the total number of iterations. `ts` is the current element being compared. `r2` is assigned the value of `i` if the condition is met. If `m1` is empty or `s2` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `r1` will remain 0. The first character of the second element of `s2` is not equal to the first character of `s2[1][1]`, and the first character of `s2[0]` is equal to the first character of `s2`***
