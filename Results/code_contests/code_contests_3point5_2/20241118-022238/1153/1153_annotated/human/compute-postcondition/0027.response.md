Postcondition: ***`m1` is not empty, `s2` has a string with a first character equal to the first element of `m1` for the match to occur, `r1` is set to the index where the match occurred or 0 if no match occurred, `i` is 2, `ts` is equal to the first character of the third element of `s2`, `r2` is assigned the value of `i`. If the first character of the third element of `s2` is equal to the second character of the second element of `s2`, then `r2` is updated to 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
