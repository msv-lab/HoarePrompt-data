Postcondition: ***`s2` is a list of strings, `i` is 3, `m1` is an iterable object with more elements, `ts` is the next element after the current `ts`, `r1` is either 0 or 2. If `ts` is equal to the first character of the first string in `s2`, then `r1` is set to 3. Otherwise, `r1` remains either 0 or 2.***
