Example Answer:
`s2` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `split()` splits the input based on whitespace. The value of `s2` will be a list of strings after splitting the input. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`s2` is a list of strings**
