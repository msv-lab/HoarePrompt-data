Postcondition: ***`m1` is not empty, `s2` has a string with a first character equal to the first element of `m1` for the match to occur, `r1` is set to the index where the match occurred or 0 if no match occurred, `i` is 3, `ts` is equal to the next element in `m1`, `r2` is 3 if `ts` is equal to the first character of the string `s2[1]`. Otherwise, `r2` remains unchanged at 2.***
