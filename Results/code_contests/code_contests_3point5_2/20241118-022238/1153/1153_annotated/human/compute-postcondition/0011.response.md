Postcondition: ***`s2` is a list of strings, `i` is 2, `m1` is an iterable object with more elements, `ts` is the next element in `m1`, `r1` is an integer. If `ts` is equal to the first character of the first string in `s2`, then `r1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. Otherwise, `r1` remains 0.***
