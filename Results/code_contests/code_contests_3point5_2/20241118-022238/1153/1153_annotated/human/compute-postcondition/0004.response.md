According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m1`. If `m1` is an iterable object, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s2` is a list of strings does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m1` is an iterable object and `ts` is the first element in `m1`.
State: **`s2` is a list of strings, `i` is 0, `m1` is an iterable object, `ts` is the first element in `m1`**
