Postcondition: ***`m1` is not empty. `s2` has a string with a first character equal to the first element of `m1`. The loop did not execute, and `r1` remains 0. If the second characters of the first and second strings in `s2` are equal and `r1` is greater than `r2`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
