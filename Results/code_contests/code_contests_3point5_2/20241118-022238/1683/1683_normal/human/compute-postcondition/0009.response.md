Example Answer:
`ai` is appended to the list `ans`. The value of `ai` is the last element in the list `a`. The list `a` has elements that are integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed. The set `vis` contains `ai`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, ans contains `ai`, vis is a set containing `ai`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, ans contains `ai`, vis is a set containing `ai`**
