Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed. `ans` is a list containing unique elements from the list `a` processed so far, `vis` is a set containing all unique elements added to `ans`. After the execution of the if-else block, `ans` will have unique elements from the list `a`, and `vis` will contain all the unique elements added to `ans`. The next unique element `ai` in list `a` will not be present in `vis`. If `ai` is already in `vis`, the loop continues without adding `ai` to `ans` or `vis`. If `ai` is not in `vis`, it is appended to `ans`, and `ai` is added to `vis` for future reference.***
