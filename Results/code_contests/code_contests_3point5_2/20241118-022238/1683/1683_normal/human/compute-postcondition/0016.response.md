Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed. `ans` is a list containing unique elements from the list `a` processed so far. `vis` is a set containing all unique elements added to `ans`. If `ai` is already in `vis`, the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, `ai` is added to `ans` and `vis` after the execution of the if-else block. The postcondition ensures that `ans` remains a list of unique elements after processing `ai`, and `vis` includes all those unique elements.***
