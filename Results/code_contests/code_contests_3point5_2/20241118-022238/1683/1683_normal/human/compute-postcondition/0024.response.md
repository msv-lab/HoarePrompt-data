Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed. Initially, `ans` is an empty list and `vis` is an empty set. After the loop execution, `ans` will contain unique elements from the list `a`, maintaining the order of appearance. `vis` will contain all unique elements added to `ans`. If a unique element `ai` is already in `vis`, no changes are made. The loop will not execute if all elements in `a` are already present in `vis`, in which case `ans` remains empty and `vis` is unchanged. `print(len(ans))`**
