Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())`, where `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` reads a line from input and strips any leading/trailing whitespaces. The value of `n` is a positive integer. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, and each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, and each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**
