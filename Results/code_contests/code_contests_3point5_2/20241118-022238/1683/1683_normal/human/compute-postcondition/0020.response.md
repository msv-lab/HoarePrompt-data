Example Answer: 
The value of `ai` is added to the set `vis`. Since `ai` is a unique element in list `a`, it is added to the set `vis`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, `ans` is a list containing unique elements from list `a`, `vis` is a set containing all unique elements added to `ans`, and the next unique element `ai` in list `a` is not present in `vis`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, `ans` is a list containing unique elements from list `a`, `vis` is a set containing all unique elements added to `ans`, and the next unique element `ai` in list `a` is not present in `vis`**
