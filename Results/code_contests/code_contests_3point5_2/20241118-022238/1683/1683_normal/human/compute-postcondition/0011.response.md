Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed. Initially, ans is an empty list and vis is an empty set. If ai is already present in vis, then no changes are made. Otherwise, ai is appended to ans and ai is added to vis. The postcondition covers all cases where ai is either already in vis or not, resulting in ans containing unique elements from the list a and vis containing all unique elements added to ans.***
