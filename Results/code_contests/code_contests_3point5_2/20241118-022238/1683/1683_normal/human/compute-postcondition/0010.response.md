Example Answer:
`vis` is a set that contains `ai`, and `vis.add(ai)` adds `ai` to the set `vis`. The values of `ai` and `vis` are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, ans contains `ai`, vis is a set containing `ai`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, ans contains `ai`, vis is a set containing `ai`**
