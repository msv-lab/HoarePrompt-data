Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the standard input, then reads a list `a` of `n` integers in reversed order. It then creates a new list `ans` containing unique elements from `a` while maintaining the original order of appearance. The function prints the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans` in reverse order. If all elements in `a` are already unique, `ans` will be empty. The function does not return any value.**
