Example Answer:
The set `vis` is initialized as an empty set. The variables `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, ans is an empty list, and vis is an empty set.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, ans is an empty list, and vis is an empty set**
