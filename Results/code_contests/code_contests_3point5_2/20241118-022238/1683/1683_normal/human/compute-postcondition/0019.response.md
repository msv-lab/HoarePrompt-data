Example Answer:
The element `ai` from list `a` is added to the `ans` list. As `ai` is unique and not present in `vis`, it is added to `ans`. The set `vis` is then updated with the new unique element `ai`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, `ans` is a list containing unique elements from list `a`, `vis` is a set containing all unique elements added to `ans`, and the next unique element `ai` in list `a` is not present in `vis`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, `ans` is a list containing unique elements from list `a`, `vis` is a set containing all unique elements added to `ans`, and the next unique element `ai` in list `a` is not present in `vis`**
