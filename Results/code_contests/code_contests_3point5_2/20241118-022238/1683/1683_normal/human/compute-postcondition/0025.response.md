Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed. `ans` contains unique elements from list `a`, maintaining order of appearance, `vis` contains all unique elements added to `ans`. If all elements in `a` are already present in `vis`, `ans` remains empty and `vis` is unchanged. `print(len(ans))`. `print(' '.join(map(str, ans[::-1])))`**
