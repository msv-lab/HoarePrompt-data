Example Answer:
The value `ai` is added to the set `vis`, which contains unique elements that have been added to `ans` so far. As `ai` is a unique element from list `a`, it is added to `vis`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, `ans` contains unique elements from list `a` processed so far (including `ai`), and `ai` is added to `vis`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, `ans` contains unique elements from list `a` processed so far (including `ai`), and `ai` is added to `vis`**
