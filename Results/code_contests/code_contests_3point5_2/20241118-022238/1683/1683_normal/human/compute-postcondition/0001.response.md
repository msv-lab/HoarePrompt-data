Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input obtained by splitting the input string by space and converting each element to an integer. The length of the list `a` is `n`, which is a positive integer, and each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, and each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, and each element in a is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**
