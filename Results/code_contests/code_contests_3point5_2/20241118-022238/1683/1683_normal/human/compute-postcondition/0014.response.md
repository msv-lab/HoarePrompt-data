Example Answer:
The value of `ai` is appended to the list `ans`. The previous values of `ans` and `vis` are unknown. Since `ai` is an element from the list `a`, which contains reversed integers, the element `ai` will be added to the list `ans`. The set `vis` will be updated with the unique elements added to `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, `ans` contains unique elements from the list `a` processed so far (including `ai`), `vis` is a set containing all unique elements added to `ans`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but reversed, `ans` contains unique elements from the list `a` processed so far (including `ai`), `vis` is a set containing all unique elements added to `ans`**
