Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 
The code correctly reads the input, reverses the list, and removes duplicate elements while maintaining the order of appearance. However, the code fails to consider the case where all elements in the array are duplicates. In such a scenario, the code should output the count of unique elements as 1 and that unique element itself, but the code does not handle this case correctly. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as per the problem description.
