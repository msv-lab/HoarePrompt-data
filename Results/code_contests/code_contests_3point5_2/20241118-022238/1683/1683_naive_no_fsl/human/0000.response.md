Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly removes duplicate elements from the array while keeping only the rightmost occurrence of each unique element. It reverses the array and iterates through it to keep track of unique elements using a set. The final array is then reversed again to maintain the original order of elements. The output also matches the expected format. The program works as described in the problem statement for all possible cases.
