Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are assigned integer values from user input split operation, `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input, `count` is assigned the value 1.0, `i` is 0. If the sum of the element of `arr` at index `i` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is incremented by 1.0. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.***
