Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the integer values of the user input split operation. The values of `n` and `k` are converted to integers using the `int()` function. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the user input split operation.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the user input split operation**
