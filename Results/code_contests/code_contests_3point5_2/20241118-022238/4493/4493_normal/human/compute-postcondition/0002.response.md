Example Answer:
The variable `arr` is assigned a map object containing integers parsed from the user input using the `map` function and `int` conversion, splitting the input by spaces. The values of `n` and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the user input split operation, `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the user input split operation, `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input**
