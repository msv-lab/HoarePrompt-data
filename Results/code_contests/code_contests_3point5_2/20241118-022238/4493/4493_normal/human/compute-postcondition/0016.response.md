Output State: **`n`, `k` are assigned integer values from user input split operation, `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input, `count` is the total number of elements in `arr` where the sum of the element and `k` is less than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.0. If there are no elements in `arr`, the loop also does not execute and `count` remains 0.0. The program prints the integer value of the floor division of `count` by 3.**
