Example Answer:
The variable `count` is assigned the value `0.0`, which is a float. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from user input split operation, and `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from user input split operation, `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input, and `count` is assigned the value `0.0`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values from user input split operation, `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input, and `count` is assigned the value `0.0`**
