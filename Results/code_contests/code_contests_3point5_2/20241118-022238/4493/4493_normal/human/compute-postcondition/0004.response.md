According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n` is assigned an integer value from user input split operation, so it already satisfies the condition. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should be adjusted to reflect the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from user input split operation, `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input, `count` is assigned the value `0.0`, and `i` is assigned the value `0`.
State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values from user input split operation, `arr` contains the mapped integers from the input, `count` is assigned the value `0.0`, `i` is 0**
