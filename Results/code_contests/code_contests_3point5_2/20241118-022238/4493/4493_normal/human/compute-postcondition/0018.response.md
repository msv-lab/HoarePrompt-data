Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, creates a list `arr` from user input integers, and counts the number of elements in `arr` where the element value plus `k` is less than or equal to 5. It then prints the integer division of the count by 3 after flooring the result. The function does not calculate the sum of the k largest integers in the list `arr` as mentioned in the annotations.**
