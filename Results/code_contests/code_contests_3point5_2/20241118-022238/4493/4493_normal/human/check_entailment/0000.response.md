Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k` as input and creates a list `arr` from the input integers. It then iterates through the list and counts the number of elements where the element value plus `k` is less than or equal to 5. 
- The code correctly determines the number of teams that can be formed based on the input values of `n`, `k`, and the list `arr`. 
- The output is then calculated by dividing the count by 3 after flooring the result, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code handles the scenario where each team must consist of exactly three people and ensures that any person cannot be a member of two or more teams. 
- Additionally, the code considers the constraint that each person can participate in the world championship at most 5 times.

Overall, the code follows the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **True**.
