The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the predefined constraints. The function returns a list of integers representing the number of students who will advance to the next round of the ACM ICPC world championship. Each element in the list corresponds to the number of times a student has participated in the championship, and each element satisfies the constraint 0 <= yi <= 5.
