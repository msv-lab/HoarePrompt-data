Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is the integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of times each student has participated in the championship. If `arr[i] + k <= 5`, `count` is incremented by 1.0 and `i` is incremented by 1. This process covers all possible scenarios where the condition is met, ensuring accurate tracking of student participation.***
