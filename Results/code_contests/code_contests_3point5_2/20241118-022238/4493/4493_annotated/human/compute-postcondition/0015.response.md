Output State: 
- `n` is an integer entered by the user
- `k` is an integer entered by the user
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of times each student has participated in the championship
- `count` is a float
- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0.0
- If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5 for any `i` in the range of `n`, then `count` is incremented by 1.0 for each valid case.
