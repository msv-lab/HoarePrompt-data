Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the integer values entered by the user. The variables `n` and `k` now hold the user input values as integers. The list `arr` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of times each student has participated in the championship.
Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of times each student has participated in the championship**
