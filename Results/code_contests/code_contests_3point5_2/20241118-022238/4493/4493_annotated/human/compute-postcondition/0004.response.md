According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `count` are given, but we need to adjust them for the loop to execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, the values need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is the integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of times each student has participated in the championship, `count` is a float initialized to 0.0**
