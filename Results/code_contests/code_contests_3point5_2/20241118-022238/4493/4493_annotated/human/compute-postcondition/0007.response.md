Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is the integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of times each student has participated in the championship, and `count` is a float. If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is incremented by 1.0. The state of the program after the if statement includes all possible scenarios where the condition is met, reflecting the increment in `count`, while also accounting for cases where the condition is not satisfied, resulting in no change in the values of the variables.***
