Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user for `n`, `k`, and a list of integers `arr`. It then iterates through the list and increments `count` by 1.0 for each element that satisfies the condition `arr[i] + k <= 5`. Finally, it prints the integer value of `count` divided by 3 rounded down. The function does not handle cases where the input values are invalid, such as non-integer inputs or incorrect list lengths.**
