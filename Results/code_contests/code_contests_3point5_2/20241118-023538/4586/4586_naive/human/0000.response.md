Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes in the two keyboard layouts and the text typed in the first layout. It then creates a dictionary mapping keys from the first layout to their respective positions. It iterates over each character in the text, checking if it is a digit, uppercase letter, or lowercase letter and then maps it to the corresponding key in the second layout using the dictionary created. The program outputs the modified text according to the second layout.

The program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly maps digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters to their corresponding keys in the second layout. The program also maintains the capitalization of the letters as specified in the problem description.
