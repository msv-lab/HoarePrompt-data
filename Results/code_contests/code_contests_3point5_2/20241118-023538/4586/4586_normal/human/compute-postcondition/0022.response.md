Postcondition: ***`dic` is empty, `s` has a length of at least 26, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `i` is 26. If the character at index 26 of string `s` is a digit, `Mods` contains '7'. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not a digit, `Mods` is updated correctly based on the conditions. If the character at index `i` of `s` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated with the uppercase character extracted from `layout2[dic[s[i].lower()]]`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated with the value of `layout2[dic[s[i]]]`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and ensures that `Mods` is correctly modified based on the conditions specified in the if-else block, handling all edge cases.***
