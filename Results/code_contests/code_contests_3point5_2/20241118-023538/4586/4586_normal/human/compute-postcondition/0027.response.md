Postcondition: ***`dic` is empty, `s` has a length of at least 26, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `i` is 27, and `Mods` is correctly updated based on the conditions. If the character at position `i` in `s` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by adding the corresponding uppercase character from `layout2` based on the lowercase character of `s[i]` from `dic`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is not uppercase, `Mods` is updated by adding the corresponding character from `layout2` based on the character at position `i` in `s` from `dic`.***
