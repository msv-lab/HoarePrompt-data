Postcondition: ***`dic` is empty, `s` has a length of at least 26, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `i` is 28, and `Mods` is correctly updated based on the conditions. If the character at index `i` in `s` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by adding the uppercase version of the character corresponding to the lowercase character at index `i` in `s` from `dic` in `layout2`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not uppercase, `Mods` is updated by adding the character corresponding to the character at index `i` in `s` from `dic` in `layout2`.***
