Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input` accepts an input as a string. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `layout1` is a string, `layout2` contains the input value, `s` is an input string.
Output State: **`layout1` is a string, `layout2` contains the input value, `s` is an input string**
