Example Answer:
`layout2` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. The function `raw_input()` accepts an input and assigns it to `layout2`. The value of `layout1` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `layout1` is a string, `layout2` contains the input value.
Output State: **`layout1` is a string, `layout2` contains the input value**
