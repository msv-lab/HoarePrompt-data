Postcondition: ***`dic` is empty, `s` has a length of at least 26, `layout1` has at least 26 characters, `i` is 26, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not a digit. If the character at index `i` of `s` is an uppercase letter, then `Mods` is updated with the uppercase character extracted from `layout2[dic[s[i].lower()]]`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not an uppercase letter, then `Mods` is updated with the value of `layout2[dic[s[i]]]`. This ensures that `Mods` is modified correctly based on the conditions specified in the if else block, covering all possible scenarios.***
