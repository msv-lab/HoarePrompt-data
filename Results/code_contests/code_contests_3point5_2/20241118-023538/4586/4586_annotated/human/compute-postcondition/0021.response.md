If s[i] is an uppercase letter, Mods will have the uppercase version of the corresponding character in layout2 based on the mapping in dic for the lowercase version of s[i]. If s[i] is not an uppercase letter, Mods will have the character from layout2 determined by the mapping in dic for s[i] directly. The dictionary dic contains the key-value pairs of the form layout1[i]: i for all i from 0 to 25, and s[i] is not a digit.
