Postcondition: ***layout1 is a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, layout2 is a non-empty string of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a maximum length of 1000 characters, s is the input string. Mods is a string that concatenates all digits in s if s[i] is a digit. If s[i] is an uppercase letter, Mods will contain the uppercase version of the corresponding character in layout2 based on the mapping in dic for the lowercase version of s[i]. If s[i] is not an uppercase letter, Mods will contain the character from layout2 determined by the mapping in dic for s[i]. The dictionary dic contains the key-value pairs of the form layout1[i]: i for all i from 0 to 25. The resulting Mods will have characters based on the specified mappings for both uppercase and lowercase letters in s, covering all possible cases and edge cases.***
