Mods is appended with the character at index dic[s[i]] in layout2. The previous values of Mods, layout1, layout2, and s are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: layout1 is a string of length 26, layout2 is a non-empty string of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a maximum length of 1000 characters, s is the input string with a length greater than the current length.
Output State: **layout1 is a string of length 26, layout2 is a non-empty string of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a maximum length of 1000 characters, s is the input string with a length greater than the current length**
