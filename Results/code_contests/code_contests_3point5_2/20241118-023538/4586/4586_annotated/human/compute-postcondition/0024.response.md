Example Answer:
The value of `Mods` is appended with the character at position `i` in the string `s`. The previous value of `Mods` is unknown, so the output state is: `layout1` is a string of length 26, `layout2` is a non-empty string of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a maximum length of 1000 characters, `s` is the input string, `Mods` is modified based on the characters in `s`.
Output State: **`layout1` is a string of length 26, `layout2` is a non-empty string of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a maximum length of 1000 characters, `s` is the input string, `Mods` is modified based on the characters in `s`**
