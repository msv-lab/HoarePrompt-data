Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user for `layout1`, `layout2`, and `s`. It then creates a dictionary `dic` mapping characters from `layout1` to their corresponding indices. After that, it iterates through the characters in `s`, determining the output string `Mods` based on specific conditions:
- If a character in `s` is a digit, it is directly added to `Mods`.
- If a character in `s` is uppercase, it finds the corresponding character in `layout2` using the mapping in `dic`, converts it to uppercase, and appends it to `Mods`.
- If a character in `s` is lowercase, it finds the corresponding character in `layout2` using the mapping in `dic` and adds it to `Mods`.
The function then prints the final `Mods` string. If `s` is empty, `Mods` remains empty. The code effectively handles different character types in `s` and generates the appropriate `Mods` output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
