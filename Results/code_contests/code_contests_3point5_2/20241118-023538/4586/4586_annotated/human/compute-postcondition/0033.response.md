Postcondition: ***layout1 is a string of length 26, layout2 is a non-empty string of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a maximum length of 1000 characters, s is the input string with a length greater than the current length, i is one more than the current value. If s[i] is an uppercase letter, Mods is appended with the corresponding uppercase character from layout2 based on the dictionary dic mapping of the lowercase version of s[i]. If s[i] is not an uppercase letter, Mods is appended with the corresponding character from layout2 based on the direct mapping from dic. In either case, Mods is updated after the execution of the if else block with the appropriate character from layout2.***
