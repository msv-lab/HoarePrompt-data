Example Answer:
`Mods` is appended with the character at index `i` of string `s`. The length of `s` is greater than the current length, and `i` is one more than the current value. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `layout1` is a string of length 26, `layout2` is a non-empty string of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a maximum length of 1000 characters, `s` is the input string with a length greater than the current length, `i` is one more than the current value, `Mods` is updated with the character at index `i` of string `s`.
Output State: **`layout1` is a string of length 26, `layout2` is a non-empty string of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits with a maximum length of 1000 characters, `s` is the input string with a length greater than the current length, `i` is one more than the current value, `Mods` is updated with the character at index `i` of string `s`**
