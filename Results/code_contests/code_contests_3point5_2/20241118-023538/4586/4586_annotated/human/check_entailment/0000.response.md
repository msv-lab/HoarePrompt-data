Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for the two keyboard layouts and the typed text.
2. It then creates a dictionary mapping each letter in the first layout to its position.
3. It iterates over each character in the typed text and checks if it is a digit, uppercase letter, or lowercase letter.
4. Based on the type of character, it appends the corresponding character from the second layout to the `Mods` string.
5. The program handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the output is generated correctly.
6. The logic of the program follows the problem description accurately, and there are no identified edge cases where it would fail to produce the correct output.
