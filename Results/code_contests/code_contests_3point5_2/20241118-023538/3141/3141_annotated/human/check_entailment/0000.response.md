Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the depth of the snow cover as described in the problem. The formula used in the program `print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` is incorrect and does not match the logic required to solve the problem.

An example where the program fails:
Input:
8 13

Expected Output:
2

Output from the program:
-19

This discrepancy shows that the program does not provide the correct output for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is false.
