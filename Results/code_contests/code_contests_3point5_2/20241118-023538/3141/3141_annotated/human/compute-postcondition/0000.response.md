Example Answer: 
`a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split by space. The values of `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500**
