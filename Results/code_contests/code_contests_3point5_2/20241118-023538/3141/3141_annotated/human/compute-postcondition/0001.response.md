Example Answer: 
The expression calculates and prints the result of `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`. The values of `a` and `b` are unknown in the initial state, but they are guaranteed to be integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500. The output state will be the result of the expression.
Output State: **The result of the expression (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a**
