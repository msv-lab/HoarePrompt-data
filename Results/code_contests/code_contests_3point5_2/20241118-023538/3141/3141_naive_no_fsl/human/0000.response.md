Correctness: False

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the depth of the snow cover as described in the problem statement. The formula used in the program `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` does not match the correct formula. For example, for the input `8 13`, the output should be `2` according to the problem description, but the program will output `-6`.
