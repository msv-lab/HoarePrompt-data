Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The formula used to calculate the depth of the snow cover is incorrect. The correct formula to find the sum of integers between a and b (inclusive) should be `(b - a + 1) * (b - a) // 2 - a`. The current formula used in the code is not accurate and will not give the correct result. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
