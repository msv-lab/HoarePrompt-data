Functionality: **The function reads two integers a and b from the user input, then calculates the sum of integers between a and b (inclusive) using a formula. However, the current implementation is incorrect as the print statement is not correctly calculating the sum. It should be fixed to provide the accurate sum as per the annotations. Additionally, the postcondition mentioned about the range of a and b should be verified in the code to ensure it is enforced.**
