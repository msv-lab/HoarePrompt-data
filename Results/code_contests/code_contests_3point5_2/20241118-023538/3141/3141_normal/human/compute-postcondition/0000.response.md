Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string using `split()` and converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `a` and `b` are unknown but are constrained by the initial state such that 1 <= a < b < 499500. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500.
Output State: **a and b are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500**
