Example Answer: 
The expression `print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` involves subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculation is done step by step:
1. Calculate `b - a` which gives a positive integer.
2. Multiply `(b - a)` by `(b - a - 1)` and then divide the result by 2.
3. Subtract `a` from the result obtained in step 2.

The output state does not change the initial state of `a` and `b`, so the output state is:
Output State: **a and b are integers such that 1 <= a < b < 499500**
