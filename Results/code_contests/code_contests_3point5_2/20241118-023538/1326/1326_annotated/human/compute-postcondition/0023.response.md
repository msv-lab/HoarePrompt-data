Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing [100000, c] or [100000, c, c]. `b` is [100000, c] or [100000, c, c] based on the condition. The variable `fail` is True if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`. The length of `a` is either 2 or 3 after the execution of the if statement. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, `c` is appended to `b` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
