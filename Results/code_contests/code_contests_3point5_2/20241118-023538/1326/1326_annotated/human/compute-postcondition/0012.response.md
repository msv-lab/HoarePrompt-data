Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with elements [100000, c], `b` remains as [100000]. `fail` is True if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`. The length of `a` is 2 after the execution of the if statement. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
