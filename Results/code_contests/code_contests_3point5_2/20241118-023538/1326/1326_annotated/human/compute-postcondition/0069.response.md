Functionality: **The function `func_4` takes a positive integer `N` as input, along with a list `P` containing 2N distinct integers in the range [1, 2N]. It then iterates through the elements of `P` in a specific manner and populates lists `a` and `b` accordingly. If at any point an element in `P` violates the conditions, the function sets `fail` to True. After processing all elements, if the length of list `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, the function also sets `fail` to True. Finally, it prints 'NO' if `fail` is True and 'YES' if `fail` is False. The function does not have a return value.**
