Output State: **`a` is a list containing [100000, c, c]. `b` is [100000, c, c]. `fail` is True if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`. The length of `a` is 3 after the execution of the if statement. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, `c` is appended to `b` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
