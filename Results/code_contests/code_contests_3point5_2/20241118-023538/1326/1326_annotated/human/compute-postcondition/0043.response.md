Example Answer:
The value of `c` is appended to list `a`. The length of `a` and `b` can be different, but the value of `c` will be added to the end of list `a`. If `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, `fail` will be True. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing either [100000, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c, c]; `b` is a list containing either [100000, c] or [100000, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c]; `fail` is True if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing either [100000, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c, c]; `b` is a list containing either [100000, c] or [100000, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c]; `fail` is True if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b.**
