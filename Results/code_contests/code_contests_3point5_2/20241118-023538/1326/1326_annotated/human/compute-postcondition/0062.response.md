Postcondition: ***If the list `P` is not empty, `a` and `b` are lists, and `fail` is set to True. The loop has executed at least once. The length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`. The variable `c` is not greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, indicating that the loop executed successfully without encountering any elements greater than `c`. If the list `P` is empty, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of `a`, `b`, or `fail`.***
