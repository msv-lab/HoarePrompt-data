Postcondition: ***`a` is a list initially containing either [100000, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c, c]; `b` is a list initially containing either [100000, c] or [100000, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c]; `fail` is True if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`. If `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, `fail` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `a`. All possible combinations and edge cases involving the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are considered, ensuring that the postcondition covers all scenarios.***
