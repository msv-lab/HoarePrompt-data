Postcondition: ***`a` is a list initially containing either [100000, c, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c]; `b` is a list initially containing either [100000, c] or [100000, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c, c, c, c]; `fail` is True if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b` or if `c` is greater than the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` and the last element of `b` are less than the length of `a` and the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to list `b`. Otherwise, `c` is appended to list `a`.***
