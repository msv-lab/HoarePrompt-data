Output State: **`a` is a list containing either [100000, c] or [100000, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c]. `b` is a list containing either [100000] or [100000, c, c] or [100000, c, c, c]. `fail` is True if `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`. If `c` is greater than the last element of both `a` and `b`, then `b` appends `c` and `fail` is set to True. Otherwise, there are no changes to `a`, `b`, and `fail` after the execution of the if statement, and the length of `a` remains either 2, 3, or 4.**
