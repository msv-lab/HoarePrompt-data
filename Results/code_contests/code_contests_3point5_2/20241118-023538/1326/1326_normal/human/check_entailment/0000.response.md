Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_4` is intended to determine if there exist two arrays `a` and `b`, each of length `n` and with no elements in common, such that `p=merge(a,b)`. However, the code does not correctly handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement.

One particular case where the code does not work correctly is when the permutation `p` is such that it cannot be merged into two arrays `a` and `b` of length `n` each with no common elements. This scenario is not handled properly in the code, leading to incorrect results.
