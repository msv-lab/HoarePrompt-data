The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`, which is a positive integer representing the length of arrays `a` and `b`, and a list `P` of 2N integers representing the permutation. The elements in `P` are integers ranging from 1 to 2N. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a positive integer `N` representing the length of arrays `a` and `b`, and a list `P` of 2N integers representing the permutation.
