Example Answer:
`b` is assigned a list containing the integer 100000. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N, a is a list containing 10^5, b is a list containing the integer 100000.
Output State: **P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N, a is a list containing 10^5, b is a list containing the integer 100000**
