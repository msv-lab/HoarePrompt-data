Example Answer:
The value of `c` is appended to list `b`. Since `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, the value of `c` is added to list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N, a is a list containing 10^5 with c appended to it if c is greater than the last element of a, b is a list containing the integer 100000 with c appended to it, fail is True, 2N is greater than 0, c is the last element in P, c is greater than the last element of b, c is appended to list b.
Output State: **P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N, a is a list containing 10^5 with c appended to it if c is greater than the last element of a, b is a list containing the integer 100000 with c appended to it, fail is True, 2N is greater than 0, c is the last element in P, c is greater than the last element of b, c is appended to list b**
