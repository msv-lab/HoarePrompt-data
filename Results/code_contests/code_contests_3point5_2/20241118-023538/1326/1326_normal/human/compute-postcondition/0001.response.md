Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned a list containing a single element, which is `10 ** 5`. The list `P` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N, a is a list containing 10^5.
Output State: **P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N, a is a list containing 10^5**
