Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts a positive integer `N` representing the length of arrays `a` and `b`, and a list `P` of 2N integers representing a permutation. It iterates through the elements in `P` in reverse order and updates arrays `a` and `b` based on specific conditions. If the length of array `a` is not equal to N + 1 after processing all elements in `P`, the function sets `fail` to True. If `fail` is True, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.**
