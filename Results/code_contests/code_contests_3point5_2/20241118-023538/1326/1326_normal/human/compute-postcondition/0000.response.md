Example Answer:
The function `func_3()` returns a list of 2N integers representing the permutation P. The elements in P are integers ranging from 1 to 2N. Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for N or the permutation P, the output state will be that P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N.
Output State: **P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N**
