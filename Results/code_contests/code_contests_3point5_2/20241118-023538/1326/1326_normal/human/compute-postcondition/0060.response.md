Postcondition: ***The loop iterates through the elements in the list P in reverse order. If the length of list a is not equal to N + 1, the following conditions are applied: 
- If the length of list a is 1, the current element c is appended to list a.
- If c is greater than the last elements of both lists a and b, the variable fail is set to True, and the loop breaks.
- If c is greater than the last element of list a but not b, c is appended to list a.
- If c is greater than the last element of list b but not a, c is appended to list b.
The loop continues until all elements in the list P have been processed. If P is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the variables a, b, and fail remain unchanged.***
