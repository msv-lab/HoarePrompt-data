Output State: **P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N excluding the last two elements, a is a list containing 10^5 integers with `c` appended to it if `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, b is a list containing the integer 100000 with `c` appended to it if `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, and fail is True. If the length of list `a` is 1, `c` is appended to list `a`. Otherwise, there is no change.**
