Postcondition: ***P is a list of 2N integers representing the permutation with elements ranging from 1 to 2N, a is a list containing 10^5 with c appended to it if c is greater than the last element of a, b is a list containing the integer 100000, fail is True, 2N is greater than 0, c is the last element in P, and c is greater than the last element of b. In all cases, the initial conditions of P, a, b, 2N, and c remain unchanged. Additionally, c is greater than the last element of a and c is greater than the last element of b.***
