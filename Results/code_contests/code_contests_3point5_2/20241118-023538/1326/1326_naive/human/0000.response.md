Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if the given permutation can be split into two arrays a and b such that merging them results in the given permutation. The program processes each test case correctly and outputs "YES" if such arrays exist and "NO" otherwise. The implementation covers all possible scenarios and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
