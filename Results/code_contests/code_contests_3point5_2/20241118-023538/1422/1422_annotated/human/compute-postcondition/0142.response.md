According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more tuples in the `ans` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the initial value of `cnt`, `first` is updated to `ind1`, and `second` is updated to `ind2` after the execution of the if block. This condition is met when the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the initial value of `cnt`. To execute the loop one more time, the `ans` list must have at least one more tuple.

State: **`label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the initial value of `cnt`, `first` is updated to `ind1`, and `second` is updated to `ind2` after the execution of the if block, and there is at least one more tuple in the `ans` list**
