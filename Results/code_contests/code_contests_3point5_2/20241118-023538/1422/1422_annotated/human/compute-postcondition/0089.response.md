Example Answer:
`first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the output state is `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, `i` is increased by 1**
