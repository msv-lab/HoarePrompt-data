Example Answer:
`third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c` as well as the minimum of `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are not provided in the initial state, so we can't calculate the exact values of `third`. Therefore, the Output State is: `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b, `i` is increased by 1, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c, and `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`.
Output State: **`first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b, `i` is increased by 1, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c, and `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c**`
