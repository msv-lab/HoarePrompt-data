Postcondition: ***`label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to be the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is modified to `i`, `second` remains unaffected, `n` remains greater than 1, and the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` at index `i` is greater than the previous value of `cnt`. The state after the execution of the if block ensures that the variables `label`, `cnt`, and `first` are appropriately updated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
