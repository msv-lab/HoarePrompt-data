Postcondition: ***All variables remain of their original types and relationships after the execution of the if-else block. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`, and a tuple with values ((one[third][0] + a), `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, `i`) is appended to `ans`. The variables `first`, `second`, `third`, and `min` are then updated based on the maximum and minimum values from the input tuples in `challengers`, ensuring the correctness of the program state. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios, maintaining the integrity of the program state.***
