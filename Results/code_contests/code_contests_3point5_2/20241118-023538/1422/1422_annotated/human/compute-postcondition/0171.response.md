Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from standard input, processes `n` sets of integers representing stones, applies a specific algorithm to these sets, and determines certain conditions based on these calculations. The function updates several dictionaries and lists during the processing. Finally, it determines a label value and outputs specific information based on the calculated results. The specific return value or outcome of the processing is not explicitly stated.**
