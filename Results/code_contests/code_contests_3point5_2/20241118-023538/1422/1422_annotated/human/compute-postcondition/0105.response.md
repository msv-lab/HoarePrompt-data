Postcondition: ***All variables `first`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `second`, `third` are assigned specific values. If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a tuple containing `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[first] and `c`, and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. In case `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `second` is in `one` but not in `two`, `two[second]` is assigned the value of `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. The postcondition ensures the integrity of the relationships between the variables in all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if-else block.***
