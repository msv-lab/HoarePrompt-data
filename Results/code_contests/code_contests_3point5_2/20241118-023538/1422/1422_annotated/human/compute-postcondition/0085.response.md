Postcondition: ***All variables remain of their original types and relationships. If `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is updated to `(a, i)`. The variables `first`, `second`, `third`, and `min` are updated according to the maximum and minimum values from the input tuples in `challengers`, ensuring the correctness of the program state in any possible scenario or edge case. After the execution of the if-else block, `ans` is appended with the appropriate tuple based on the conditions mentioned.***
