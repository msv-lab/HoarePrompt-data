Postcondition: ***`label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the initial value of `cnt`, `first` is updated to `ind1`, and `second` is updated to `ind2` after the execution of the if block. This condition is met when the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the initial value of `cnt`.***
