Postcondition: ***`first`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `second`, `third` are assigned values according to specific conditions. If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a tuple is appended to `ans`. The tuple consists of `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`, and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. The postcondition covers all possible cases and edge conditions of the program after the if else block executes.***
