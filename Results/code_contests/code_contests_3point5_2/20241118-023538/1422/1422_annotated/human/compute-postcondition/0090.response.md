Example Answer:
`second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`. The value of `a` is not provided, but `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`. The value of `c` is also not provided. The value of `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b, `i` is increased by 1, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c`.
Output State: **`first` is assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b, `i` is increased by 1, `second` is assigned the maximum of `a` and `c`, and the minimum of `a` and `c**`
