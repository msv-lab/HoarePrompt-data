Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer read from standard input. The value of `n` represents the number of stones. The program reads the lengths of edges of each stone from standard input. Each stone is represented by three integers: `ai`, `bi`, and `ci`. The lengths of edges of each stone are between 1 and 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of stones, and each stone is represented by three integers ai, bi, ci where 1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of stones, and each stone is represented by three integers ai, bi, ci where 1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 10^9**
