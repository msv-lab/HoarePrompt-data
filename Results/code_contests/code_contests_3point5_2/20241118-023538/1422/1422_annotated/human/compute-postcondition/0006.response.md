Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from mapping the input to integers. The `map(int, stdin.readline().split())` takes an input line, splits it, and maps each element to an integer. Assuming the input line contains 3 integers separated by spaces, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold these values respectively. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, i is 1, ans is an empty list, challengers is an empty list, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 1, ans is an empty list, challengers is an empty list, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer**
