Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, all variables remain of their original types and relationships. If `first` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`, `one[first]` is updated to `(c, i)`. In all cases, the integrity of the program state is maintained, ensuring that `ans` is appended with the appropriate tuple based on the conditions mentioned. Additionally, the variables `first`, `second`, `third`, and `min` are updated according to the maximum and minimum values from the input tuples in `challengers`, guaranteeing the correctness of the program state in any possible scenario or edge case.***
