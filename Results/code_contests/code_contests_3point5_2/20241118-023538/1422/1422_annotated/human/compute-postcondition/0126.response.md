Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. The condition states that the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` should be greater than the current value of `cnt`. Therefore, `cnt` will hold the smallest value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the current value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`label` is 2, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the current value of `cnt`, `ans` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple**
