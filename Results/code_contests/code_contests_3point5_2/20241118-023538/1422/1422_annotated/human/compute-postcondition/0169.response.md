Postcondition: ***If label is equal to 1, the loop executes n times. After each iteration, label is set to 1, cnt is updated to the minimum value among a, b, and c, first is updated to the current index i, and second remains unchanged. stdout writes '1' followed by a newline and the value of (first + 1). If label is not equal to 1 or n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain in their initial state: label is 0, cnt, first, and second remain unchanged or are set to their initial values (empty or 0). Ensure that the minimum value among a, b, and c is correctly assigned to cnt after n iterations.***
