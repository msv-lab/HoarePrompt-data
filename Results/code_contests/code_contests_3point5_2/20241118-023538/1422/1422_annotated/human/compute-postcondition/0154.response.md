Example Answer:
`cnt` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the previous value of `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `label` is 1, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is updated to `i`, `second` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, and the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the previous value of `cnt`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the challengers at index `i.
Output State: **`label` is 1, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is updated to `i`, `second` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, and the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the previous value of `cnt`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the challengers at index `i**
