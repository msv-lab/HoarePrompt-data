Postcondition: ***`first`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `second`, `third` are assigned specific values. If `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `first` is in `one` but not in `two`, `two[first]` is updated to the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `second` is in `one` but not in `two`, `two[second]` is assigned `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. The postcondition ensures the integrity of the relationships between the variables after the if-else block has executed, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
