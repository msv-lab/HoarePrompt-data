Example Answer:
`challengers` is appended with a tuple `(a, b, c)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `first`, `second`, `third`, `min`, `one`, `a`, `challengers`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`first`, `second`, `third`, `min`, `one`, `a`, `challengers`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `i` is increased by 1**
