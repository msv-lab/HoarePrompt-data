Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, all variables remain of their original types and relationships. If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, a tuple containing the sum of `one[third][0]` and `c`, `third[0]`, `third[1]`, `one[third][1]`, and `i` is appended to `ans`, and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + c`. If `second` is in `one`, `two[second]` is assigned the value of `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple with values ((one[second][0] + b), `second[0]`, `second[1]`, `one[second][1]`, `i`) is appended to `ans`. The variables `first`, `second`, `third`, and `min` are then updated based on the maximum and minimum values from the input tuples in `challengers`, ensuring the correctness of the program state. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios, maintaining the integrity of the program state.***
