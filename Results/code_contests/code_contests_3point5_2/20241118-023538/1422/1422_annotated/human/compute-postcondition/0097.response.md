Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of `first`, `second`, `third` respectively, `i` is increased by 1. If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of the first element of `one[first] and `c`, and a tuple containing (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to `ans`.***
