Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 1, ans is a list containing tuples with values (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), challengers contains tuples with unspecified values, a, b, c, first, second, third, min are all integers. If first is in two and two[first] is less than one[first][0] + c, then the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to ans, and two[first] is updated to one[first][0] + c. If first is not in two but in one, then two[first] is assigned the value of one[first][0] + c and the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to ans. Additionally, if second is in two and two[second] is less than one[second][0] + c, the new tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) is appended to ans and two[second] is updated to one[second][0] + b. If second is not in two but in one, two[second] is assigned the value of one[second][0] + b, and the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) is added to ans. After the execution of the program fragment, if two[third] is less than one[third][0] + c, the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i) is appended to ans, and two[third] is updated to one[third][0] + a, ensuring all possible edge cases are handled.***
