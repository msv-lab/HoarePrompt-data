Postcondition: ***`label` is set to 2, `cnt` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the initial value of `cnt`, `first` is updated to `ind1`, and `second` is updated to `ind2`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the initial value of `cnt`, the mentioned assignments take place. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
