Example Answer: 
`second` is assigned the value of `ind2`, and `ind2` is updated to a new value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is updated to `ind1`, and `second` is updated to a new value.
Output State: **`label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is updated to `ind1`, and `second` is updated to a new value**
