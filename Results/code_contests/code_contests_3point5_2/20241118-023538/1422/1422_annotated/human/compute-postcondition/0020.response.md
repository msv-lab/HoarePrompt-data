Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 1, ans is a list containing a tuple with values (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), challengers contains a tuple with unspecified values, a, b, c are integers, first is the maximum of a and b, second is the maximum of a and c, third is the maximum of b and c, min is the minimum of b and c, first is not in two. If first is in one, then two[first] is assigned the value of one[first][0] + c and the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to ans.***
