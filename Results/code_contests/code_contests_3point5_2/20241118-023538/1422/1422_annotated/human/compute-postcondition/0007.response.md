Example Answer: 
A tuple containing the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` is appended to the `challengers` list. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not given, so the output state is: n is greater than 0, i is 1, ans is an empty list, challengers contains a tuple with unspecified values, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 1, ans is an empty list, challengers contains a tuple with unspecified values, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer**
