Example Answer:
`two` is assigned an empty dictionary. The dictionary `one` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of stones, and each stone is represented by three integers ai, bi, ci where 1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 10^9; `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of stones, and each stone is represented by three integers ai, bi, ci where 1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 10^9; `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary**
