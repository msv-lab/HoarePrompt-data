Example Answer:
The variable `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. The previous value of `ind2` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `label` is 2, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the current value of `cnt`, `ans` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `first` is assigned the value `ind1`, `second` is assigned the value `ind2`.
Output State: **`label` is 2, `cnt` is the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the current value of `cnt`, `ans` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `first` is assigned the value `ind1`, `second` is assigned the value `ind2`**
