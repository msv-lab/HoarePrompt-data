Postcondition: ***`label`, `cnt`, `first`, `second` are integers. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than `cnt`, the function updates `label` to 2, `cnt` to that minimum value, `first` to `ind1`, and `second` to `ind2`. The state of the program after the execution ensures that the variables have been updated accordingly based on the conditions met.***
