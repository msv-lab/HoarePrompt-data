Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 1, ans contains a tuple with values (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), challengers contains a tuple with unspecified values, a, b, c, first, second, third, min are all integers. If two[first] is less than one[first][0] + c, then the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to ans. The value of two[first] is updated to the sum of one[first][0] and c. The state of the program after the if else block executes covers all edge cases, ensuring the correct handling of the specified variables and their relationships.***
