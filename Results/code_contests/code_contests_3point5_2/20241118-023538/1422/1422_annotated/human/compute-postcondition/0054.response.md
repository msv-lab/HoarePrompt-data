Example Answer:
The values of a, b, and c are assigned by mapping integer inputs from standard input. The previous values of a, b, and c are unspecified. Therefore, after execution, the values of a, b, and c will be the integer inputs. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 2, ans is a list containing tuples with values (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), challengers contains tuples with unspecified values, a, b, c, first, second, third, min are all integers, a, b, c are now assigned the integer inputs**
