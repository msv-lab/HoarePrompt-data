Output State: **If n is at least 1, the loop will execute n times. After each iteration, `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` that is greater than the previous value of `cnt`, `first` is updated to `ind1`, and `second` is updated to `ind2`. These updates occur based on the condition where the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the previous value of `cnt`. In cases where n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain in their initial state (empty or 0).**
