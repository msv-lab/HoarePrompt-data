Postcondition: ***All variables remain of their original types and relationships, ensuring the integrity of the program state after the execution of the if else block. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, the ans list is updated with a tuple containing the sum of `one[second][0]` and `c`, `second[0]`, `second[1]`, `one[second][1]`, and `i`. Additionally, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + c`. The variables `first`, `second`, `third`, and `min` are then updated based on the maximum and minimum values from the input tuples in `challengers`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios, ensuring the correct state of the program after the if else block has executed.***
