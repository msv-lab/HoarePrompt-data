Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 1, ans is a list containing tuples with values (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), challengers contains tuples with unspecified values, a, b, c, first, second, third, min are all integers. If first is in two and two[first] is less than one[first][0] + c, then the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to ans, and two[first] is updated to one[first][0] + c. If first is not in two but in one, then two[first] is assigned the value of one[first][0] + c and the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to ans. The program handles all possible cases ensuring correct variable values and relationships are maintained. If second is in two***
