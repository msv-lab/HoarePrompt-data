The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing a set of input data based on the provided constraints. The input data consists of 'n' lines, each containing three integers ai, bi, ci representing the lengths of edges of the i-th stone. The function processes this input data according to a specific algorithm or logic, but the return value is not specified.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of input data representing the lengths of edges of stones and applies a specific algorithm to this data. The specific return value or outcome of this processing is not specified.**
