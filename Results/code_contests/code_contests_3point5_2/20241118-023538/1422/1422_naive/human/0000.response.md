Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the volume of the resulting parallelepiped after gluing two stones together and then selects the two stones with the maximum possible volume for carving a sphere. It considers all possible combinations of gluing two stones together and also the option of choosing just one stone if it has the maximum volume. The program outputs the correct indices of the stones to be chosen based on the calculated volumes. The logic seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
