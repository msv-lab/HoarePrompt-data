The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the number of stones that are considered beautiful. The beauty of a stone is determined by the following conditions:
1. If the sum of the three integers representing the stone is even, the stone is considered beautiful.
2. If the sum of the three integers representing the stone is odd, the stone is not considered beautiful.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the number of beautiful stones based on the given constraints.
