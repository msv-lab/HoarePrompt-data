Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` from standard input and then iterates `n` times, reading three integers in each iteration. It calculates certain values based on comparisons and updates dictionaries and lists accordingly. After processing, it determines the beauty of stones based on specific conditions and outputs the results. The program handles cases where `n` is 0 by not executing the loops and leaving the data structures empty. The functionality does not align with the annotations as it involves stone beauty calculations rather than financial calculations as described in the annotations.
