Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is a dictionary with `first` as one of its keys, `two` is a dictionary with `first` and `second` as keys. If `first` is not in `two` but in `one`, then `two[first]` is assigned the sum of the first element of the list `one[first]` and `c`, and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `first`, `second` remain unchanged. The variable `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, while the minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in another variable. `two[second]` is assigned the value `one[second][0] + b`.**
