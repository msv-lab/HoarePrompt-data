Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is a dictionary with `first` as one of its keys, `two` is a dictionary with `first` and `second` as keys. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, with `i` being incremented by 1. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not in `two` but in `one`, `two[third]` is assigned the sum of the first element of the list `one[third]` and `a`, and a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not in `one`, no changes are made to the dictionaries. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `first`, `second` remain unchanged. The minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in another variable.***
