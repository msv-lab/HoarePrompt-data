Example Answer:
The dictionary `one` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is an empty dictionary**
