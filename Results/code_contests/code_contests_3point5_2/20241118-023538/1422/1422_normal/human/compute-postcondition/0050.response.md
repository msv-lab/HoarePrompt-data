Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is a dictionary with `first` as one of its keys, `two` is a dictionary with `first` and `second` as keys, the minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in another variable. If `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, `one[second]` is updated to `b, i`. If `first` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`, `one[first]` is updated to `c, i`, a tuple `(one[first][0] + a, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + a`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `first` is not in `one`, no changes are made to the dictionaries. Additionally, if `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, `one[third]` is updated to `a, i`, and the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `i` is incremented by 1***
