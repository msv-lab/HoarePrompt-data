According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `cnt` is the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c`, `label` is 1, `first` is updated to `i`, `second` is `ind2`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the `challengers` list at index `i`, and the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`. To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`n` is 1, `first` is updated to `i+1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the `challengers` list at index `i+1`, and the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`.**
