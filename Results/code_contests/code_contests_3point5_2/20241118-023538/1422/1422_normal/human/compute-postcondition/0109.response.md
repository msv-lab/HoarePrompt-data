Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` and `two` are dictionaries, the minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in a separate variable, `i` is incremented by 1, a tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`, `first`, `second`, and `third` are assigned specific values based on `(a, b, c)`. If `second` is in dictionary `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b. If `second` is in dictionary `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a.**
