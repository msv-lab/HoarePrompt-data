Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is a dictionary with `first` as one of its keys, `two` is a dictionary with `first` and `second` as keys. If `two[third]` was less than `one[third][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans` and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `first`, `second` remain unchanged.***
