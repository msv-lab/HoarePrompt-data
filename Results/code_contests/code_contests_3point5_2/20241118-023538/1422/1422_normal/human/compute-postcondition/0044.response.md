Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is a dictionary with `first` as one of its keys, `two` is a dictionary with `first` and `second` as keys. If `(first not in one or one[first][0] < c)` is true, then the following changes occur: a tuple `(one[first][0] + a, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + a`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `first` is not in `one`, no changes are made to the dictionaries. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `first`, `second` remain unchanged. The minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in another variable.***
