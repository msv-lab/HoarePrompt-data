Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5. If `first` is in the dictionary `one`, then `two[first]` is updated with the value of `one[first][0] + c`. Additionally, a new tuple is appended to `ans` consisting of the values `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. The overall state after the execution of the if block includes the updates made to `two`, the newly added tuple in `ans`, and the relationships between the variables such as `first`, `challengers`, `second`, and `third`. It ensures that the program handles all possible scenarios within the given constraints and accurately reflects the changes in the variables based on the if condition.***
