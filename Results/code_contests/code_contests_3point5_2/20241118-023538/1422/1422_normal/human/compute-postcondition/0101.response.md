Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5. `one` and `two` are dictionaries. The minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in a separate variable. `i` is incremented by 1. A tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`. `first`, `second`, and `third` are assigned specific values based on `(a, b, c)`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. This postcondition covers all scenarios and edge cases arising from the execution of the if-else block.***
