Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` and `two` are dictionaries with possible updates based on conditions. The minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in a separate variable. A new tuple is appended to `ans` with the values calculated based on the conditions specified in the code snippet. The value of `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`.***
