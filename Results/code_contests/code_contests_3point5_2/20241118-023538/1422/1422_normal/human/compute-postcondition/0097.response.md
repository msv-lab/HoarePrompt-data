Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` and `two` are dictionaries, minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in a separate variable, `i` is incremented by 1, a tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`, `first` is assigned `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`, `second` is assigned `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`, `third` is assigned `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`. If `first` is in dictionary `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and a tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)` is appended to `ans`.***
