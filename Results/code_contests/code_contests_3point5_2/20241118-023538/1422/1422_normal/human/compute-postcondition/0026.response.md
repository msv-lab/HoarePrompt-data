Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is a dictionary with `first` as one of its keys, `two` is a dictionary with `first` as one of its keys. If `two[second]` is less than the sum of the first element of the list `one[second]` and `c`, then a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. If `second` is not in `two`, but in `one`, then `two[second]` is assigned the sum of the first element of the list `one[second]` and `c`, and a tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `first`, `second` remain unchanged. The variable `third` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, while the minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in another variable.***
