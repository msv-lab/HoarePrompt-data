Example Answer:
A tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not given, but `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. Therefore, `challengers` will have a new tuple appended to it.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is a dictionary with possible updates based on conditions, `two` is a dictionary with possible updates based on conditions, the minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in another variable, `challengers` contains the newly appended tuple**
