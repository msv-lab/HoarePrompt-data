Example Answer: 
The `first` variable is assigned the tuple `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `first` will be `(a, b)`, otherwise it will be `(b, a)`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` and `two` are dictionaries, minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in a separate variable, `i` is incremented by 1, a tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`, and `first` is assigned `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` and `two` are dictionaries, minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in a separate variable, `i` is incremented by 1, a tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`, `first` is assigned `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`**
