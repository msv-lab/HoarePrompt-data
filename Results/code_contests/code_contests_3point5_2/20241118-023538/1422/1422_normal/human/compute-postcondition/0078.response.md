Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` and `two` are dictionaries. The minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in a separate variable. If `third` is in dictionary `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. A new tuple is appended to `ans` with values `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. The relationships between `first`, `challengers`, `second`, and `third` are accurately maintained. All possible cases within the constraints are handled, ensuring the correct updates to `two`, the appended tuple in `ans`, and the relationships between the variables.***
