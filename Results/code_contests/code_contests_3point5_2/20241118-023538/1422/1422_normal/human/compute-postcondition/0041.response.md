Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is a dictionary with `first` as one of its keys, `two` is a dictionary with `first` and `second` as keys, if `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is assigned the maximum of `b` and `c`, and a tuple `(one[third][0] + c, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `first`, `second` remain unchanged, the minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in another variable.**
