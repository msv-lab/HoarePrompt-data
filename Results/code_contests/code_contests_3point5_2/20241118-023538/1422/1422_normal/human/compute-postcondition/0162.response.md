Postcondition: ***`n` is 1, `first` is updated to `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the `challengers` list at index `i+1`, and the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`. If the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, `label` is assigned the value 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is updated to `i`.***
