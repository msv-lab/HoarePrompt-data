Example Answer: 
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers. The variables `n`, `one`, `two`, `ans`, `challengers`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input**
