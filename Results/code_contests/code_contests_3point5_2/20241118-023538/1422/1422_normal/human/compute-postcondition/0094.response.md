Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `one` and `two` are dictionaries. The minimum of `b` and `c` is stored in a separate variable. `i` is incremented by 1. A tuple `(a, b, c)` is appended to the list `challengers`. `first`, `second`, and `third` are assigned specific values based on `(a, b, c)`. If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, a tuple with calculated values is appended to `ans` and `two[first]` is updated. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the if else block executes.***
