Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer read from standard input. The value of `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 10^5. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 10^5.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^5**
