Output State: **If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute. `one` and `two` dictionaries, `ans` list, and `challengers` list will remain empty. `cnt` is assigned the value that is the minimum between `a`, `b`, and `c`. `ans` list contains at least one tuple. The minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`. `label` is assigned the value 2. `first` is assigned the value `ind1`. `second` is assigned the value `ind2`.**
