Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5. After the execution of the if-else block, if `second` is in dictionary `two` and the value of `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, a new tuple is appended to `ans` with values `(one[second][0] + c, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + c`. If `second` is in dictionary `one`, `two[second]` is updated with the value of `one[second][0] + c` and a new tuple is appended to `ans`. The updated values of `two`, the appended tuple in `ans`, and the relationships between `second`, `challengers`, `first`, and `third` are accurately maintained. The postcondition covers all possible cases within the specified constraints, ensuring comprehensive handling of variable changes based on the conditions in the code snippet.***
