Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `one` dictionary is empty, `two` dictionary is empty, `ans` list is empty, `challengers` list is empty, `cnt` is the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c`, `label` is 1, `first` is updated to `i`, `second` is `ind2`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the `challengers` list at index `i`, and the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`. Additionally, `label` is updated to 1, `cnt` is updated to the new minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is updated to `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.***
