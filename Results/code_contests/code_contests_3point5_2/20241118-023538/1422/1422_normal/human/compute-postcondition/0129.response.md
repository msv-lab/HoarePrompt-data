Postcondition: ***If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `one` and `two` dictionaries, `ans` list, and `challengers` list empty with `cnt` remaining 0. If the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than the current `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value between `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is set to `ind1`, and `second` is set to `ind2`. The `ans` list contains at least one tuple. All possible edge cases, including when `n` is not 0, are handled appropriately.***
