Postcondition: ***If n is 0, the loop does not execute, resulting in the dictionaries one and two, the lists ans and challengers, and the integer cnt all being empty. The ans list contains at least three tuples. Variable label is set to 2. Variable cnt is updated to the minimum value among variables a, b, and c. Variables first is assigned the value of ind1 and second is assigned the value of ind2. Overall, after the if else block executes, the program variables are updated with the described values and relationships, ensuring that the minimum value among a, b, and c is stored in cnt, and the variables first and second are assigned the values of ind1 and ind2 respectively.***
