Correctness: **False**

Although the code seems to be handling the logic of choosing the stones based on specific conditions, it does not align with the problem description provided. The problem description states that Zahar should present Kostya with a pair of stones that can be glued together to form a rectangular parallelepiped from which Kostya can carve a sphere with the maximum possible volume. However, the code seems to be calculating "beauty" values for the stones based on comparisons and updating dictionaries and lists accordingly. This does not match the financial calculations described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect solution.
