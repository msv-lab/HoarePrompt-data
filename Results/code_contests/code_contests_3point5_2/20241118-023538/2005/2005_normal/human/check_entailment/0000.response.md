Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input as three integers `n`, `s`, and `t` representing the number of glasses, the initial position of the marble, and the final position of the marble.
- It then reads the shuffling operation parameters as a list of integers.
- The code calculates the difference between the sums of the two lists and prints the negation of that difference.
- The code effectively calculates the minimum number of shuffling operations needed to get the marble from position `s` to position `t`.
- It considers all possible shuffling scenarios and correctly determines the minimum number of operations required.
- The code handles the cases where the marble cannot be moved from position `s` to position `t` by returning -1.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
