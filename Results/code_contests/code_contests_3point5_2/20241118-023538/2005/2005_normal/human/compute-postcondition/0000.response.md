Example Answer:
The lambda function `IN` reads input values as integers. The variables `n`, `s`, `t` are integers within specified ranges, and the list of shuffling operation parameters `p1, p2, ..., pn` contains distinct integers between 1 and n. The lambda function does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n, s, t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= s, t <= n. The list of shuffling operation parameters p1, p2, ..., pn contains distinct integers between 1 and n.
Output State: **n, s, t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= s, t <= n. The list of shuffling operation parameters p1, p2, ..., pn contains distinct integers between 1 and n.**
