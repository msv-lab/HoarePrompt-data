Example Answer:
The lambda function `IN` reads input from the user and splits it into integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. However, the initial state does not contain any variables that are affected by this lambda function. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Precondition: n, s, t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= s, t <= n. pi's are distinct integers such that 1 <= pi <= n.**
