Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of shuffling operations needed to move the marble from position s to position t. It calculates the difference between the sum of the input parameters for the initial position and the sum of the input parameters for the final position. If the difference is positive, it represents the number of shuffling operations needed. If the difference is negative, it means the marble cannot move from position s to position t, and the program outputs -1. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
