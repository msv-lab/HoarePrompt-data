Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It simply calculates the difference between the sum of the input values on the first line and the sum of the input values on the second line. This approach does not consider the actual shuffling operations and does not determine if the marble can move from position s to position t. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect. An example where the program fails to produce the correct output is when:
Input:
4 2 1
2 3 4 1

Expected Output:
3

Actual Output:
-6
