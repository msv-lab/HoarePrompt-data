You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya are playing a game. Petya's got n non-transparent glasses, standing in a row. The glasses' positions are indexed with integers from 1 to n from left to right. Note that the positions are indexed but the glasses are not.

First Petya puts a marble under the glass in position s. Then he performs some (possibly zero) shuffling operations. One shuffling operation means moving the glass from the first position to position p1, the glass from the second position to position p2 and so on. That is, a glass goes from position i to position pi. Consider all glasses are moving simultaneously during one shuffling operation. When the glasses are shuffled, the marble doesn't travel from one glass to another: it moves together with the glass it was initially been put in.

After all shuffling operations Petya shows Vasya that the ball has moved to position t. Vasya's task is to say what minimum number of shuffling operations Petya has performed or determine that Petya has made a mistake and the marble could not have got from position s to position t.

Input

The first line contains three integers: n, s, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ s, t ≤ n) — the number of glasses, the ball's initial and final position. The second line contains n space-separated integers: p1, p2, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — the shuffling operation parameters. It is guaranteed that all pi's are distinct.

Note that s can equal t.

Output

If the marble can move from position s to position t, then print on a single line a non-negative integer — the minimum number of shuffling operations, needed to get the marble to position t. If it is impossible, print number -1.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
