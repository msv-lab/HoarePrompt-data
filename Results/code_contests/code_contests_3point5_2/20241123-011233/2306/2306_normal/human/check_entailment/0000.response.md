Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code seems to be missing the implementation of the process described in the problem description. The provided code is calculating some prefix sums and finding certain indices, but it does not seem to implement the process described in the problem. The output hints do not fully agree with the code as they do not match the process described in the problem. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not perform the required process.
