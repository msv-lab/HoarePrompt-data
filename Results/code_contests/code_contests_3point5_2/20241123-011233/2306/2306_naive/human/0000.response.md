Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the process described in the problem statement. It calculates the value of `res` after the process ends for each test case. The program initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and then processes each test case. It correctly calculates the prefix sum of the input string `s` and identifies the important points based on the prefix sum. It then calculates the final result `ans` according to the process described. The logic and implementation seem to be correct for all potential cases.
