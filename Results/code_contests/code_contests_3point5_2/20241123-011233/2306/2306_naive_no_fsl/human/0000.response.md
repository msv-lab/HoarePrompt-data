Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the process described in the problem description. The logic in the program seems to be different from what is specified in the problem. The program calculates the value of 'res' in a different way using prefixes and does not follow the given pseudocode.

To illustrate the incorrectness of the program, consider the following input:
```
1
--++
```
According to the given pseudocode, the value of 'res' should be 7. However, the program provided will not produce the correct result for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
