Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hands of an analog clock based on the input values of A, B, H, and M. The program uses the provided formulas to calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands at the given time and then calculates the distance between the endpoints using the Euclidean distance formula. 

The program takes into account all the constraints mentioned in the problem description and accurately calculates the distance without any logical errors. Additionally, the program uses the standard input and output methods required for the given problem. 

Since the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output based on the input values, it can be considered correct for all potential cases.
