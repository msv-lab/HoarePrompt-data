Output State: **A and B are integers representing the lengths of the hour and minute hands of the analog clock, H is an integer representing the hours elapsed since 0 o'clock, with 0 <= H <= 11, M is an integer representing the minutes elapsed since the last full hour, with 0 <= M <= 59, the function register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())) is called, h, m, a, b, t1 are assigned the integer values extracted from the input split, t2 is assigned the value of radians(m % 60 * 6), x1 is assigned the value of -a * sin(-t1), y1 is assigned the value of a * cos(-t1), x2 is assigned the value of -b * sin(-t2), and y2 is assigned the value of b * cos(-t2). The code calculates the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and prints the result.**
