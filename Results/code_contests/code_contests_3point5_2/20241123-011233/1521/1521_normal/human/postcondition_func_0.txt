The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It calculates the angle between the hour and minute hands of an analog clock based on the lengths of the hour and minute hands (A and B), and the hours (H) and minutes (M) elapsed since 0 o'clock. The function then prints the calculated angle between the hour and minute hands of the analog clock.
