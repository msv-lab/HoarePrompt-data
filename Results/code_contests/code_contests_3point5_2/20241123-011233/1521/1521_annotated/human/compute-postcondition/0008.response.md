Example Answer:
The value of `x1` is calculated using the values of `a`, `t1`, and `sin` function. Since the initial state does not provide the values of `a` or `sin(-t1)`, we cannot determine the exact value of `x1`. Therefore, the output state is: A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is assigned a calculated value based on H and M; t2 is a calculated value in radians between 0 and 6.283.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is assigned a calculated value based on H and M; t2 is a calculated value in radians between 0 and 6.283**
