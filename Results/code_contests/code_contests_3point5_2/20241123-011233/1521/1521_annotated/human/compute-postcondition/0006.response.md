Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned the value of the expression `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`, where `h` is an integer between 0 and 11 inclusive, and `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive. The calculation involves modulo operation, multiplication, and addition based on `h` and `m` values. 
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is assigned a calculated value based on H and M**
