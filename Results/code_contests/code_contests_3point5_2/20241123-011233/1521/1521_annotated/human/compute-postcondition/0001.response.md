Example Answer:
The code assigns the standard output to a BytesIO object. This change does not affect the initial state variables A, B, H, and M. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000. H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11. M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59.**
