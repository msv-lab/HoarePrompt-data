Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces. The values of `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59**
