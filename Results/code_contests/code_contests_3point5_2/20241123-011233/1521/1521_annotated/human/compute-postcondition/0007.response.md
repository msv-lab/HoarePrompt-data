Example Answer: 
t2 is assigned the value of radians(m % 60 * 6), where m is between 0 and 59. The value of m % 60 will always be between 0 and 59, so m % 60 * 6 will always be between 0 and 354. The radians function converts the value to radians. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is assigned a calculated value based on H and M; t2 is a calculated value in radians between 0 and 6.283 (approximately).
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 1000; H is an integer such that 0 <= H <= 11; M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 59; t1 is assigned a calculated value based on H and M; t2 is a calculated value in radians between 0 and 6.283**
