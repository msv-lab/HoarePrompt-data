Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly calculates the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the clock hands based on the input values of A, B, H, and M. The program uses the provided formulas for calculating the positions of the hour and minute hands at the given time and then computes the distance between the endpoints using the distance formula.

The program accounts for the constraints mentioned in the problem description and uses the appropriate trigonometric functions to calculate the positions of the clock hands accurately. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and the calculations are done correctly, we can conclude that the program is correct.
