Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function that takes a starting index and a branch length as input and prints the connections between nodes based on the problem description. The function iterates over the branch length and connects nodes accordingly. The logic followed in the code aligns with the problem description of connecting nodes in a network with minimum possible number of wires while satisfying the conditions of exit-nodes and stability. Since the code implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement and connects nodes in a valid manner, we can conclude that the code is correct.
