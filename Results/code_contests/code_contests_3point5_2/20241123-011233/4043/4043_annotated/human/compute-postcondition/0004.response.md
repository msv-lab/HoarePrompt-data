Example Answer:
The code prints the values of `i` and `i + 1` formatted in the given string format. The values of `i` and `i + 1` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot calculate them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, new values of `startIndex` and `branchLength` such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, new values of `startIndex` and `branchLength` such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`**
