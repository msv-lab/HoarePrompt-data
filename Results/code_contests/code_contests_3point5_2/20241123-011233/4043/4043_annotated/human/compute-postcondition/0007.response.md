According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n` holds true. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `startIndex` is an integer, `branchLength` is an integer such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `startIndex` needs to be increased by `branchLength - 1` and `branchLength` needs to be adjusted accordingly. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `startIndex` is an integer increased by `branchLength - 1`, `branchLength` is an integer**
