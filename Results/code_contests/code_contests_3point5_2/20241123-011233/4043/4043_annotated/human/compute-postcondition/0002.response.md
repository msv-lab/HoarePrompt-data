Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the values of `i` and `i + 1` using string formatting. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `i`, we cannot determine the exact values. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, `startIndex` and `branchLength` are integers that satisfy the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, `startIndex` and `branchLength` are integers that satisfy the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`**
