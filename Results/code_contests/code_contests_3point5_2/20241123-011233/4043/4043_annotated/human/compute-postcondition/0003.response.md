According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, `startIndex` and `branchLength` are integers that satisfy the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the values of `startIndex` and `branchLength` need to be adjusted such that the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n` still holds true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, new values of `startIndex` and `branchLength` such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`**
