According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n` holds true. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, and `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n` is satisfied. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to increment either `startIndex` or `branchLength` in a way that the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n` is still satisfied. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n - 1, new values of `startIndex` and `branchLength` such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n` and the loop can execute one more time**
