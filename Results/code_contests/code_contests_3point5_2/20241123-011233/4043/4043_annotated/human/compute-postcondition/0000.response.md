Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the values 1 and `startIndex` in a formatted string. The value of `startIndex` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, so it remains unknown. Therefore, the output state is: n and k are integers such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 2 <= k <= n - 1.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 3 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 2 <= k <= n - 1**
