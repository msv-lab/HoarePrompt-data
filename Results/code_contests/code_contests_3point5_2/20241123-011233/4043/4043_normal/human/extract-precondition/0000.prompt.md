You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Arkady needs your help again! This time he decided to build his own high-speed Internet exchange point. It should consist of n nodes connected with minimum possible number of wires into one network (a wire directly connects two nodes). Exactly k of the nodes should be exit-nodes, that means that each of them should be connected to exactly one other node of the network, while all other nodes should be connected to at least two nodes in order to increase the system stability.

Arkady wants to make the system as fast as possible, so he wants to minimize the maximum distance between two exit-nodes. The distance between two nodes is the number of wires a package needs to go through between those two nodes.

Help Arkady to find such a way to build the network that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is as small as possible.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes.

Note that it is always possible to build at least one network with n nodes and k exit-nodes within the given constraints.

Output

In the first line print the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes. In each of the next n - 1 lines print two integers: the ids of the nodes connected by a wire. The description of each wire should be printed exactly once. You can print wires and wires' ends in arbitrary order. The nodes should be numbered from 1 to n. Exit-nodes can have any ids.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 2


Output

1 2
2 3


Input

5 3


Output

3
1 2
2 3
3 4
3 5

Note

In the first example the only network is shown on the left picture.

In the second example one of optimal networks is shown on the right picture.

Exit-nodes are highlighted.
