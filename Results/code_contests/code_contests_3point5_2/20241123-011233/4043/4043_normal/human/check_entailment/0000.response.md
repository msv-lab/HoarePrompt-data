Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input of the total number of nodes `n` and the number of exit nodes `k`.
- It calculates the minimum length of each branch based on the total number of nodes and the number of exit nodes.
- It then calculates the maximum distance between the two most distant exit nodes.
- The function `func_1` is used to connect the nodes based on the calculated branch lengths.
- The code prints the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit nodes and the connections between the nodes as required.

The code seems to follow the problem description accurately and provides the expected output based on the given input. The output hints also align with the code logic, further confirming its correctness.
