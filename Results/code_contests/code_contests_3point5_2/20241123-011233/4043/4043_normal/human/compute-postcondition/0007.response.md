Since the loop iterates over the range from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **No specific adjustment needed**
