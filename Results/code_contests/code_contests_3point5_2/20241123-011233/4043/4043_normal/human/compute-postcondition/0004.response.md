Example Answer: 
The values of `i` and `startIndex + branchLength - 1` are used to print `i` and `i + 1`. Since the values of `startIndex` and `branchLength` are not given, the specific values of `i` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and the print statement `print('{0} {1}'.format(i, i + 1))` is executed.
Output State: **`i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, print statement executed**
