According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `startIndex`, `branchLength`, and the condition `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`. The variables `n` and `k` are given as 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. 

To ensure the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `startIndex` should be such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`.
2. `startIndex` should be adjusted to satisfy the conditions of the loop.
3. `branchLength` should be adjusted such that `startIndex + branchLength - 1 < n`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `startIndex` is adjusted to meet the loop condition, `branchLength` is adjusted to meet the loop condition**
