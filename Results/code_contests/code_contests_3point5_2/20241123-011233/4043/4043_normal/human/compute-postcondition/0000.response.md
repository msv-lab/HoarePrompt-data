Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the formatted string '{0} {1}'. The placeholders {0} and {1} are replaced by the values 1 and `startIndex` respectively. The previous values of variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1**
