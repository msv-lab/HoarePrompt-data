According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `startIndex`, and `branchLength`. If `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and the print statement has been executed. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `startIndex + branchLength`.
State: **`i` is `startIndex + branchLength`, print statement executed**
