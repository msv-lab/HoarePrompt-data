The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `startIndex` and `branchLength`, which are integers. The precondition for these parameters is that `n` and `k` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The function returns the value of `startIndex + branchLength`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters, `startIndex` and `branchLength`, and return the sum of these two values.
