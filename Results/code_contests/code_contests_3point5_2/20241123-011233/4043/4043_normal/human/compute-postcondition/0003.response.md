Since the code snippet provided is iterating over a range from `startIndex` to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be `startIndex + branchLength - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`**
