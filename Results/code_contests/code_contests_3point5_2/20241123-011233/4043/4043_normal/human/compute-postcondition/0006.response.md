Example Answer: 
The print statement is executed with the format string '{0} {1}'. The variables `i` and `i + 1` are passed into the format method, where `i` is equal to `startIndex + branchLength`. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the values of `i` and `i + 1` after substitution. 
Output State: **The print statement with the values of `i` and `i + 1` after substitution is executed**
