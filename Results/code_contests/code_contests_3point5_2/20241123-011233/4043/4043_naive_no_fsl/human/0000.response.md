Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input values for the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes. It then calculates the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes and prints it. The program then proceeds to create a network by connecting nodes in a way that satisfies the given constraints.

The program iterates over the exit-nodes and connects them to other nodes in a way that minimizes the distance between them. The connections are made such that each exit-node is connected to exactly one other node, while all other nodes are connected to at least two nodes.

The program follows the problem description and provides a valid solution for building the network as described. Since the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and there are no potential cases identified where it may fail, the correctness is deemed to be true.
