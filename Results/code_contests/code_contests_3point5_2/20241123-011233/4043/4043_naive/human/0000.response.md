Correctness: **True**

The program takes in the input values for the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes, calculates the minimum distance between the two most distant exit-nodes, and then generates the connections between nodes accordingly. The program iterates through the nodes and connects them in a way that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description.

The program seems to handle all cases where the number of nodes and exit-nodes satisfies the constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) and should provide a valid output based on the problem requirements. Since the program follows the problem description and there are no specific cases mentioned where it fails, we can conclude that the code is correct.
