You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are playing the game "Arranging The Sheep". The goal of this game is to make the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one square to the right, if the corresponding square exists and is empty. The game ends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty cells between any sheep.

For example, if n=6 and the level is described by the string "**.*..", then the following game scenario is possible: 

  * the sheep at the 4 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "**..*."; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "*.*.*."; 
  * the sheep at the 1 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ".**.*."; 
  * the sheep at the 3 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ".*.**."; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "..***."; 
  * the sheep are lined up and the game ends. 



For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

The second line of each test case contains a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep) — the description of the level.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case output the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
    af = []
    for zorg in range(int(le.pop())):
        n = int(le.pop())
        
        l = le.pop()
        
        l = [k for k in range(n) if l[k] == '*']
        
        l = [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]
        
        if l:
            med = l[len(l) // 2]
            af.append(sum(abs(k - med) for k in l))
        else:
            af.append(0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the list le is not empty, the loop calculates the sum of absolute differences between each element in list l and the middle element med for each test case. The variables are updated accordingly - t remains the same, n is updated with the value popped from le, l is a list of absolute differences between the index and value of each element, med is the middle element of list l, and af is updated with the sum of absolute differences. If list l is empty for a test case, 0 is appended to af. If le is empty, the loop does not execute and af remains an empty list.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, af)))

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
