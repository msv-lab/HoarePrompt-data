Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The function reads the input correctly by splitting it based on newline characters and reversing the order to access elements in a stack-like manner.
2. It correctly iterates over the test cases and calculates the minimum number of moves required to line up the sheep in each test case.
3. The program correctly handles cases where there are no sheep present by appending 0 to the final output.
4. The calculation of the absolute differences and finding the middle element of the list of sheep positions is done correctly to determine the minimum moves needed.
5. The final output is printed in the required format.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input.
