According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value popped from the list le. If there are more elements in le, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a value is popped from le and assigned to n. So for the loop to execute one more time, le must not be empty. Therefore, le should have at least one element left after popping. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^4, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6, le is a list containing the input strings for each test case in reverse order with at least one element remaining, af is a list. If list l is not empty, af contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in list l and the middle element med. If list l is empty, af contains 0. zorg is 0, n is assigned the value popped from le, l is a list of absolute differences between the index and value of each element. In all cases, the result is stored in list af.**
