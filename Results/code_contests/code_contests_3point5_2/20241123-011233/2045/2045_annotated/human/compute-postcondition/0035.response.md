Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the standard input, processes test cases involving strings of '.' and '*', calculates the sum of absolute differences between each element and the middle element of the list, and prints the results. If the input string for a test case is empty or does not contain '*', the function appends 0 to the output list. However, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.**
