Output State: **If list le is not empty, the loop calculates the sum of absolute differences between each element in list l and the middle element med for each test case. The variables are updated accordingly - t remains the same, n is updated with the value popped from le, l is a list of absolute differences between the index and value of each element, med is the middle element of list l, and af is updated with the sum of absolute differences. If list l is empty for a test case, 0 is appended to af. If le is empty, the loop does not execute and af remains an empty list. The final output is printed with each value separated by a new line using '\n'.**
