Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^4, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6, le is a list containing the input strings for each test case in reverse order with at least one element remaining, af contains the sum of absolute differences between each element in list l and the middle element med, zorg is 0. If l is not empty, n is updated with the value popped from le, med is assigned the middle element of list l, af is updated with the sum of absolute differences for the current case. If l is empty, 0 is appended to af. Furthermore, l is a list containing elements where each element k satisfies the condition l[k] == '*', and it is updated to contain the absolute differences between each element and its index.***
