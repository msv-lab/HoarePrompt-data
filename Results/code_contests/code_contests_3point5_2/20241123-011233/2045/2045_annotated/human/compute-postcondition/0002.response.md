According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value popped from the list le. If there are elements in le, the loop can execute. At the start, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^4, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6, and af is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted: le must have at least 1 element popped, zorg is 0.
State: **t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^4, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6, le is a list containing the input strings for each test case in reverse order with at least one element popped, af is an empty list, zorg is 0**
