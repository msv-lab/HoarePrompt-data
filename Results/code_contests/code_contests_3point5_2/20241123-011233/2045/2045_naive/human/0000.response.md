Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, identifies the positions of the sheep, calculates the distance of each sheep from the middle sheep, and sums up the absolute distances to determine the minimum number of moves required to line up the sheep. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. Since there is no case where the program fails to produce the correct output, the program is considered correct.
