Postcondition: ***`af` is a list, `le` is empty, `n` has the value popped from `le` due to an IndexError, an IndexError occurs while trying to access an element from an empty list `le` in the list comprehension. If list `l` is not empty, the median `med` is calculated as the element at index len(l) // 2 of list `l`. The absolute differences between each element `k` in list `l` and the median `med` are summed up and appended to list `af`. If list `l` is empty, 0 is appended to list `af`***
