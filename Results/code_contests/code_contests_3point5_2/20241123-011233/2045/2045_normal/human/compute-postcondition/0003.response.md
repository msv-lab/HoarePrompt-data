Example Answer:
The value popped from `le` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. Since `le` has at least one element to pop, the value popped from `le` is assigned to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is an empty list, `le` is now empty, `zorg` is the value popped from `le` which is now assigned to `n`.
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` is now empty, `zorg` is the value popped from `le` which is now assigned to `n`**
