According to the code, the loop can execute if the value popped from `le` is a valid index for the range. At the end of the last iteration, `af` is a list, `le` is empty. To execute the loop one more time, `le` should contain at least one valid index to pop from. Additionally, since `le` is popped from and used as a range value, the popped value should be a non-negative integer.
State: **`af` is a list. If `l` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and its median. If `l` is empty, `af` contains 0. `le` contains a non-negative integer that is a valid index to pop from.**
