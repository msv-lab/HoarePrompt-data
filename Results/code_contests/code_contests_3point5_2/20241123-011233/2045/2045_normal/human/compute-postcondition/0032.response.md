Output State: **After the loop executes, `af` will contain the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. If `le` is empty, `af` will contain 0. If an IndexError occurs while trying to access an element from an empty list `le`, the loop will not execute and `af` will remain an empty list.**
