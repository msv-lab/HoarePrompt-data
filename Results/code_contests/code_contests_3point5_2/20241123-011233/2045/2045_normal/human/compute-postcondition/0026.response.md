Example Answer:
The list `l` is modified to contain the absolute differences between each element and its index. The previous value of `l` is unknown, so the new values cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: If `le` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. If `le` is empty, `af` contains 0. `l` is the element removed from the end of `le`.
Output State: **If `le` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. If `le` is empty, `af` contains 0. `l` is the element removed from the end of `le`.**
