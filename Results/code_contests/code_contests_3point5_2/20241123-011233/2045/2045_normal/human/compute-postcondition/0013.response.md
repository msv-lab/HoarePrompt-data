According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `int(le.pop())` which is the value popped from the list `le`. Since an IndexError occurred while trying to access an element from an empty list `le`, the loop will not execute anymore. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`af` is a list, `le` is empty, `n` has the value popped from `le` due to an IndexError**
