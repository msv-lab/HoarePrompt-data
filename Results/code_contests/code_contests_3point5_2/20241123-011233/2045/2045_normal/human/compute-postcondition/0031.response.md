According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `le` after popping an element. If the length of `le` is greater than 0, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `le` is not empty as an element is removed and `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. The median `med` is calculated based on the updated `le`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `le` after popping an element should be greater than 0.
State: **If `le` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. If `le` is empty, `af` contains 0. `l` is the element removed from the end of `le`. In either case, the median `med` is calculated as the element at index `len(l) // 2` in the list `l`, and this value is used to calculate the absolute differences for `af`. If `le` is empty, only 0 is appended to `af`.**
