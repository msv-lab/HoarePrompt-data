Example Answer:
The value popped from list `le` is assigned to variable `l`. Since `le` is empty, an error will occur. The value of `l` is not defined. The value popped from `le` was assigned to a variable `n` which was not mentioned before. As the list is empty, the value of `n` will be `IndexError`. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is an empty list, `le` is now empty, `zorg` is the value popped from `le` which is now assigned to `n` with an `IndexError`.
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` is now empty, `zorg` is the value popped from `le` which is now assigned to `n` with an `IndexError`**
