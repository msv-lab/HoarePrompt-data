Example Answer: 
An IndexError occurs when trying to pop from an empty list `le`, and the program will raise an exception and stop executing. Since the exception is raised, no variables are affected, and the output state remains: `af` is a list, `le` is empty, and an IndexError occurs when trying to pop from an empty list.
Output State: **`af` is a list, `le` is empty, and an IndexError occurs when trying to pop from an empty list**
