Example Answer: 
The code attempts to iterate over the list `l` using enumerate and calculate the difference between the elements. However, since `le` is empty, an IndexError will occur when trying to pop from an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `af` is a list, `le` is empty, IndexError occurs when trying to pop from an empty list.
Output State: **`af` is a list, `le` is empty, IndexError occurs when trying to pop from an empty list**
