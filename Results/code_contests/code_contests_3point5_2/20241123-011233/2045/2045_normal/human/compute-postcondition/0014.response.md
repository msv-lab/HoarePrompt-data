Example Answer:
The value of `n` is assigned the integer value popped from the empty list `le`, which results in an IndexError. The previous value of `n` is not relevant in this case. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is a list, `le` is empty, and an IndexError occurs when trying to pop from an empty list.
Output State: **`af` is a list, `le` is empty, and an IndexError occurs when trying to pop from an empty list**
