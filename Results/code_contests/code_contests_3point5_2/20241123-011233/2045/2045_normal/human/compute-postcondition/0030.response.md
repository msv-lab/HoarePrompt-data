Postcondition: ***If `le` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. If `le` is empty, `af` contains 0. `l` is the element removed from the end of `le`. In either case, the median `med` is calculated as the element at index `len(l) // 2` in the list `l`, and this value is used to calculate the absolute differences for `af`. If `le` is empty, only 0 is appended to `af`.***
