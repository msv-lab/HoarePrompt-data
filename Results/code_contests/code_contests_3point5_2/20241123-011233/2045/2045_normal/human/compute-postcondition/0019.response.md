Example Answer:
The absolute difference between each element `k` in list `l` and the median `med` is calculated, then summed up, and the result is appended to the list `af`. The list `le` remains empty. The code snippet does not specifically mention the values of `af`, `le`, or `med`, so the output state is: `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences, `le` is empty.
Output State: **`af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences, `le` is empty**
