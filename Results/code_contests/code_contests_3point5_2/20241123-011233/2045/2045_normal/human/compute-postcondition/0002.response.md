According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value popped from the list `le` and stored in `zorg`. If the `le` list has at least one element to pop, the loop can execute. Since `af` is an empty list at the start, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `le` must have at least one element to pop, and `zorg` is the value popped from `le`.
State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` has at least one element to pop, `zorg` is the value popped from `le`**
