Example Answer:
The median `med` is assigned the value of the element at index `len(l) // 2` in the list `l`. The value of `l` is the element removed from the end of `le`. If `le` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. If `le` is empty, `af` contains 0.
Output State: **If `le` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. If `le` is empty, `af` contains 0. `l` is the element removed from the end of `le`. The median `med` is assigned the value of the element at index `len(l) // 2` in the list `l`.**
