Example Answer:
The code appends 0 to the list `af`. The list `af` already contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median if `le` is not empty. If `le` is empty, `af` contains 0. The value of `l` is not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **If `le` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median as well as 0 appended to it. If `le` is empty, `af` contains only 0. `l` is the element removed from the end of `le`.**
