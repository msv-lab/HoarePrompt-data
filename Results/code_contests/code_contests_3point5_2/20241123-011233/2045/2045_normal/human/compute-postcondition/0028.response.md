Example Answer:
The absolute differences between each element of `l` and its median are calculated and summed up. The sum is then appended to the list `af`. The element `l` is removed from the end of `le`, and the median `med` is updated accordingly. If `le` was empty, `af` would contain 0. 
Output State: **If `le` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `le` and its median. If `le` is empty, `af` contains 0. `l` is removed from the end of `le`. The median `med` is assigned the value of the element at index `len(l) // 2` in the list `l`.**
