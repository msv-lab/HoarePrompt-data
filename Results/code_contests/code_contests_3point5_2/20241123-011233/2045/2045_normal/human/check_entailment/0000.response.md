Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the sum of absolute differences between each element and its median, which is not the same as determining the minimum number of moves needed to make the sheep line up as described in the problem. Additionally, the code does not handle the case of moving the sheep to the left or right as required by the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
