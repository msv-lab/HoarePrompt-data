Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, and the string itself.
2. It then calculates the minimum number of moves required to line up the sheep in each test case by finding the median sheep position and calculating the sum of absolute differences between each sheep position and the median.
3. The program outputs the correct minimum number of moves for each test case.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input.
