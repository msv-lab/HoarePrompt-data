Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides. It handles the input constraints and outputs "Yes" if the condition is met, and "No" otherwise. The logic seems to be correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.
