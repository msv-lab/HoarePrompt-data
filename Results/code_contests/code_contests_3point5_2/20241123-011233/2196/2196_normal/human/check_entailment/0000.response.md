Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer `N` representing the number of sides of the polygon, followed by a list of integers `listL` representing the lengths of each side. It then calculates the sum of all side lengths and subtracts the maximum side length from the total sum. If the maximum side length is less than the new sum, it prints 'Yes' indicating that an N-sided polygon can be drawn, otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The code aligns with the problem description and meets all the constraints provided. It correctly determines if an N-sided polygon with the given side lengths can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane based on the theorem provided. The output also agrees with the expected output 'Yes' or 'No' depending on the input values. Since the code covers all potential cases and produces the correct output for each case, the correctness is True.
