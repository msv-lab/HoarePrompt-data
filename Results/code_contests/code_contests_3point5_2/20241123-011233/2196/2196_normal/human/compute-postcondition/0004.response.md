According to the code, the loop can execute as long as N is greater than or equal to 0. The loop iterates from 0 to N-1. Since maxL is not used within the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. At the start of the loop, the sum is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is 0**
