Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]` at index `i` to it. The previous value of `sum` is 0. Therefore, the new value of `sum` is the sum of the previous value of `sum` and the element at index `i` of `listL`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is the updated sum**
