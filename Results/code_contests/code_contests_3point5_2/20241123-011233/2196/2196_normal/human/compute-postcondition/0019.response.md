Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `N` from the user input, followed by a list of integers `listL`. It then calculates the sum of the elements in `listL`, subtracts the maximum value in the list from the sum, and prints 'Yes' if the maximum value is less than the new sum, otherwise prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on user input. It may result in unexpected behavior if the input does not follow the expected format or constraints.
