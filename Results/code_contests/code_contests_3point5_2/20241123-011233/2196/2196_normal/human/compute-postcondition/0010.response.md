According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable N. If N is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, N is greater than 0. Since N being greater than 0 ensures the loop will execute again, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum value from listL, sum is updated**
