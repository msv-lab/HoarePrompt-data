Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]`. The previous values of `N`, `maxL`, and `sum` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is updated.
Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `maxL` is the maximum value from listL, `sum` is updated**
