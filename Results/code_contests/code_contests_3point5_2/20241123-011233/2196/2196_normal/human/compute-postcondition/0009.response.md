Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]`. The previous values of `sum` and `listL[i]` are not provided, so the new value of `sum` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum value from listL, sum is updated.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum value from listL, sum is updated**
