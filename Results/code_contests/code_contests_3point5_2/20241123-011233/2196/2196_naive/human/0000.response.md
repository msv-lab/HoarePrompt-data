Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by taking the input of N and the list of side lengths L. It then calculates the sum of all side lengths and subtracts the maximum side length to get the sum of the other sides. Finally, it compares if the maximum side length is less than the sum of the other sides and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. The logic implemented in the program adheres to the theorem provided in the problem description. Additionally, the program handles the constraints specified for the input values. Overall, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
