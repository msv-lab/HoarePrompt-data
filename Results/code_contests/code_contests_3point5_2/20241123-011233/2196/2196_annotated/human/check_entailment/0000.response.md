Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and uses the provided theorem to determine if an N-sided polygon can be drawn given the side lengths. It calculates the sum of all side lengths and subtracts the longest side length. Then, it checks if the longest side length is strictly shorter than the sum of the other side lengths to determine if a polygon can be drawn. The program outputs "Yes" if true and "No" if false. The program handles all potential cases and meets the constraints specified in the problem description.
