According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 0. This ensures that the loop will execute again. Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, sum is the updated sum of elements in `listL`**
