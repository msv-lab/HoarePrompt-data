Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the element at index `i` of `listL`. The previous value of `sum` and the elements of `listL` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, and `sum` is the updated sum of elements in `listL`.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, and `sum` is the updated sum of elements in `listL`**
