Example Answer: 
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in `listL`. The previous value of `sum` is the sum of elements in `listL`, and the value of `i` is not specified. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `sum` will be the sum of elements in `listL` plus the element at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, sum is the updated sum of elements in `listL`**
