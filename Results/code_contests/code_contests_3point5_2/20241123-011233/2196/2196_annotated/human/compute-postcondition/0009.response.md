Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in `listL`. The previous value of `sum` is unknown, but it increases by the value of `listL[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, and `sum` is the updated sum of elements in `listL.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, and `sum` is the updated sum of elements in `listL**
