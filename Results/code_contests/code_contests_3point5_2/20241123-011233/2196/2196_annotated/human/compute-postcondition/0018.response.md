The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the preconditions that N is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, and L_i are integers such that 1 <= L_i <= 100 for i from 1 to N. The function does not return any specific output based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output based on the given preconditions.**
