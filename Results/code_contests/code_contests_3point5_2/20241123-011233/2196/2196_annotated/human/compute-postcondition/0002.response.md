Example Answer: 
The variable `maxL` is assigned the value of the maximum integer in the list `listL`. The value of `N` is an input integer and the list `listL` contains integers. After execution, `maxL` will hold the maximum integer value from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an input integer, `listL` is a list of integers, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `listL`.
Output State: **N is an input integer, `listL` is a list of integers, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `listL`**
