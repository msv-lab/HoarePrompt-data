Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is decremented by the value of `maxL`. The previous values of `sum` and `maxL` depend on the initial state conditions where N > 0. Therefore, the output state is: If N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, and `sum` is the sum of elements in `listL` with `sum` decreased by `maxL`.
Output State: **If N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, and `sum` is the sum of elements in `listL` with `sum` decreased by `maxL`**
