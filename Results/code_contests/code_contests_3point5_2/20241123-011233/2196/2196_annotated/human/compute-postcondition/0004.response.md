According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of N. If N is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the maximum integer from `listL` (maxL) is needed for comparison inside the loop. Also, the sum needs to be updated based on the elements of `listL`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `listL`, and `sum` is the sum of elements in `listL`.
State: **N is greater than 0, maxL is the maximum integer from `listL`, sum is the sum of elements in `listL**
