Example Answer: 
`W`, `a`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5**
