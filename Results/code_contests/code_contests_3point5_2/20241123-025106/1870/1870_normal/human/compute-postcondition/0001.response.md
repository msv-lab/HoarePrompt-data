Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `a` + `W`, where `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5. The value of `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`**
