Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value `c + W`. The values of `c` and `W` are integers within the given constraints. Therefore, `d` will be the sum of `c` and `W`. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`; `d` is the sum of `c` and `W`**
