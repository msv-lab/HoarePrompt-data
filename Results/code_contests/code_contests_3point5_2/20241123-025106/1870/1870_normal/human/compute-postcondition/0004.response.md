Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is calculated by subtracting `b` from `c`. The value of `c` is constrained to be greater than `b`, and `b` is determined by specific values of `a` and `W`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `ans` is `c - b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`; `d` is the sum of `c` and `W`; `ans` is `c - b`**
