Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers `W`, `a`, and `c` from user input. It then calculates values for `b` and `d` based on the input values. If `b` is less than `c`, it computes the difference `c - b` and assigns it to `ans`. If `b` is not less than `c`, it then checks if `d` is less than `a`. If `d` is less than `a`, it calculates `a - d` and assigns it to `ans`. If `d` is not less than `a`, it sets `ans` to 0. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`.**
