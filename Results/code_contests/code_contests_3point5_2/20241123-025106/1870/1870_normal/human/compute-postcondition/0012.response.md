Example Answer:
`b` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `W`. `d` is the sum of `c` and `W`. If `b` < `c`, then `ans` is calculated as `c - b`. If `d` < `a`, `ans` is set to `a - d`. If `d` >= `a`, `ans` is set to 0. The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`; `d` is the sum of `c` and `W`; and the value of `ans` based on the conditions provided.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`; `d` is the sum of `c` and `W`; and the value of `ans` based on the conditions provided.**
