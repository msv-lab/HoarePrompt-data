Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ `a`, `c` ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`; `d` is the sum of `c` and `W`. The value of `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. Additionally, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`; `ans` is 0**
