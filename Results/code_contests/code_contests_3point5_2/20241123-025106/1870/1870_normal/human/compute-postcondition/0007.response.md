Example Answer:
`d` is the sum of `c` and `W`, so if `c` is 5 and `W` is 3, then `d` is 8. The value of `a` is given, let's say `a` is 10. Therefore, `ans` is calculated as `a - d`, which is `10 - 8 = 2`. The Output State is: `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`; `d` is the sum of `c` and `W`. The value of `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. `d` is less than `a`, `ans` is 2.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, and `c` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^5; `b` is determined by the specific values of `a` and `W`; `d` is the sum of `c` and `W`. The value of `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. `d` is less than `a`, `ans` is 2**
