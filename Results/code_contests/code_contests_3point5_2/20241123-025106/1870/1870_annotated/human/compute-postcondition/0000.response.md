Example Answer:
W, a, and c are assigned values from the input after splitting. Since the code snippet contains a typo (c instead of b), the variable c will not be assigned a value. Therefore, the output state is W, a are assigned values from the input, and c remains unchanged.
Output State: **W, a are assigned values from the input, and c remains unchanged**
