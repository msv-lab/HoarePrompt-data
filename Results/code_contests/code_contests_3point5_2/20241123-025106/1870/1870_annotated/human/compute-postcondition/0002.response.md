Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `c + W`, where `c` remains unchanged, and `W` is assigned a value from the input. The value of `b` is calculated as `a + W`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `W` and `a` are assigned values from the input, `c` remains unchanged, `b` is calculated as a + W, and `d` is calculated as c + W.
Output State: **`W` and `a` are assigned values from the input, `c` remains unchanged, `b` is calculated as a + W, and `d` is calculated as c + W**
