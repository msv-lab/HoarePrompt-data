Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `a + W`, where `W` and `a` are assigned values from the input. The value of `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a` are assigned values from the input, `c` remains unchanged, `b` is calculated as a + W.
Output State: **`W`, `a` are assigned values from the input, `c` remains unchanged, `b` is calculated as a + W**
