Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a - d`, where `a` and `d` have specific values. The value of `a` is from the input, and `d` is calculated as `c + W` where `c` remains unchanged. As `d` is less than `a`, the subtraction `a - d` will result in a specific value for `ans`. The other variables `W`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this calculation.
Output State: **`W` and `a` are assigned values from the input, `c` remains unchanged, `b` is calculated as a + W, and `d` is calculated as c + W. The value of `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. `d` is less than `a`. `ans` is assigned the result of the subtraction `a - d`.**
