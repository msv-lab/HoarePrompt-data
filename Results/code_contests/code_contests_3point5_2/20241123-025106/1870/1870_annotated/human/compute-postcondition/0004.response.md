Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is calculated as `c - b`. Since `b` is calculated as `a + W` and `d` is calculated as `c + W`, where `b` is less than `c`, the difference `c - b` will result in a positive value. Therefore, the Output State is: `W`, `a`, `c` are assigned values from the input. `b` is calculated as a + W, `d` is calculated as c + W. The value of `b` is less than the value of `c`, and `ans` is a positive value resulting from the subtraction `c - b`.
Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c` are assigned values from the input. `b` is calculated as a + W, `d` is calculated as c + W. The value of `b` is less than the value of `c`, and `ans` is a positive value**
