Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes the input values of W, a, and c. It then calculates the values of b and d based on the input. It then checks two conditions:
1. If b is less than c, it calculates the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved by finding the positive difference between c and b.
2. If d is less than a, it calculates the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved by finding the positive difference between a and d.
If both conditions fail, it means that the second rectangle does not need to be moved, so it sets the distance to 0.

The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Hence, the correctness of the code is **True**.
