Correctness: False

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly calculate the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved in all scenarios. 

For example, if the input is "3 2 1", the program should output 0 as the second rectangle does not need to be moved. However, the current program logic would result in an incorrect output. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
