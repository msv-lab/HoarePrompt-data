According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`, `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`, and `i` is less than `k`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **`n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`, `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`, `i` is less than `k + 1`**
