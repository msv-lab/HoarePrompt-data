Postcondition: ***'n' and 'k' are values returned by func_2(). If 'n' is equal to 'k', the program returns a range from 1 to 'k' inclusive. If 'n' is equal to 'k + 1', the program returns a range from 1 to 'k - 2' inclusive, followed by 'k' and 'k - 1'. Otherwise, no action is taken by the program.***
