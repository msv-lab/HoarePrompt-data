The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. The function relies on values returned by another function `func_2`, denoted as 'n' and 'k'.

In Case_1, if 'n' is equal to 'k', the program returns a range from 1 to 'k' inclusive. Otherwise, no action is taken by the program.

In Case_2, if 'n' is equal to 'k', the program returns a range from 1 to 'k' inclusive. If 'n' is equal to 'k + 1', the program returns a range from 1 to 'k - 2' inclusive, followed by 'k' and 'k - 1'. Otherwise, no action is taken by the program.

In Case_3, if 'n' is equal to 'k', the loop will execute and update the variables as described in the loop. If 'n' is equal to 'k + 1', the loop does not execute. If 'n' is not equal to 'k' or 'k + 1', the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to rely on values returned by `func_2`, and based on the relationship between 'n' and 'k', perform specific actions or no action at all.
