Example Answer:
The value of `a` at index `k - 1` is assigned the value `i`. Given that `n` is less than or equal to `k`, and `k` is greater than 0, we know that `k - 1` is a valid index for list `a`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, and `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`**
