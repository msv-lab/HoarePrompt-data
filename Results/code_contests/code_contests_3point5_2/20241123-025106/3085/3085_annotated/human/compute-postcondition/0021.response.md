Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`, `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`, `curInv` is assigned the return value of `func_8(a, n)`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the program updates and returns the list `ans` where the range is from 1 to `k + 1`, `ans[k - 1]` is updated with the value of `i`, and `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `k`.**
