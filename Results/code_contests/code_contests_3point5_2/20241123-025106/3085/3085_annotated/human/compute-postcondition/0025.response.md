Output State: 
- If 'n' is equal to 'k', the loop will update 'a' with values based on the logic provided in the loop. 'curInv' will be assigned the return value of 'func_8(a, n)'. If 'curInv' is less than or equal to 'maxInv', the program will update and return the list 'ans'. If 'n' is not equal to 'k' or 'k + 1', the loop will not execute.
- If 'n' is equal to 'k', the loop will update 'a' at index 'k - 1' with the value of 'i', 'a[k - 2]' will be equal to 'k', 'a[k]' will be assigned the value of 'k'. 'curInv' will be assigned the return value of 'func_8(a, n)'. If 'curInv' is less than or equal to 'maxInv', 'ans' will be updated and returned.
- If 'n' is equal to 'k + 1', the loop will not execute.

Output State: **If n is equal to k the loop will execute and update the variables as described in the loop. If n is equal to k + 1 the loop does not execute. If n is not equal to k or k + 1 the loop does not execute.**
