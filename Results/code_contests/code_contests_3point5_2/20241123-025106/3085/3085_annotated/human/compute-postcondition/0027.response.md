Functionality: **The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It relies on values returned by another function `func_2`, denoted as 'n' and 'k'. If 'n' is equal to 'k', the program returns a range from 1 to 'k' inclusive. If 'n' is equal to 'k + 1', the program returns a range from 1 to 'k - 2' inclusive, followed by 'k' and 'k - 1'. If neither condition is met, the loop in the function does not execute. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is conditioned by the relationship between 'n' and 'k'.**
