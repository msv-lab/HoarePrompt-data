Example Answer:
`a[k - 2]` is assigned the value `k`, where `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is greater than 0, `k - 2` is a valid index for list `a`. The value of `k` is always greater than `n`, so the value of `a` at index `n - 1` is updated with the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`, and `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`**
