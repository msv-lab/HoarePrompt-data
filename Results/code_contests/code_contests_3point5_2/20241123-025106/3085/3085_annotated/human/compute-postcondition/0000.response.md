Example Answer:
The function `func_2()` is called and returns two values that are assigned to `n` and `k`. The values returned by `func_2()` are unknown, so the output state is `n` and `k` have been assigned values returned by `func_2()`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` have been assigned values returned by `func_2()`**
