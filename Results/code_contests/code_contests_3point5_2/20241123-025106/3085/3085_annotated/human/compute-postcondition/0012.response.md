Example Answer:
The value of `a` at index `k` is updated to `k`, where `k` is greater than 0. Since `a[k - 1]` has already been updated with the value of `i`, and `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`, the output state is: `n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`, and `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` has been updated at index `k - 1` with the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`, `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`**
