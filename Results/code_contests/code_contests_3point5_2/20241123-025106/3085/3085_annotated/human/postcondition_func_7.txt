The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `n`, a non-negative integer representing the length of `arr`. The function calculates the total number of inversions in the array `arr` using Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) data structure. It initializes `invcount` to 0, creates a list `BIT` of zeros up to the maximum element in `arr`, updates the BIT list based on `arr` elements using functions `func_6` and `func_7`, and increments `invcount` accordingly. The function then returns the final value of `invcount` after all iterations. Potential edge cases to consider are when `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `BIT` remains a list of zeros up to 1. Also, if `maxElement` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `BIT` remains a list of zeros up to the maximum value in `arr`.
