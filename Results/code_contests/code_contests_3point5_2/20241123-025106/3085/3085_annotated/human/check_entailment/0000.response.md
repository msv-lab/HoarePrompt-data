Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines functions to handle user input, calculate inversions, and determine the permutation 'p' that maximizes 'b' lexicographically without increasing the total number of inversions.
2. The functions are well-structured and follow the logic described in the problem statement.
3. The program iterates over test cases, calculates the permutation 'p' based on the given conditions, and outputs the result for each test case.
4. There are no obvious logical errors or edge cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
5. The provided annotations help in understanding the flow of the program and the purpose of each function.
