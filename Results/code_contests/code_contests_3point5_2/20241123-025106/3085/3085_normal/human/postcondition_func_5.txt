The function `func_6` accepts two parameters: `BITree`, which is a Binary Indexed Tree data structure, and `index`, which is an integer representing the index in the BITree. The function calculates the sum of the values at the modified indices in the BITree based on the given `index`. If `index` is greater than 0, the sum is calculated by modifying the indices in the BITree. The function returns this calculated sum. If `index` is 0 or negative, the sum remains 0.
