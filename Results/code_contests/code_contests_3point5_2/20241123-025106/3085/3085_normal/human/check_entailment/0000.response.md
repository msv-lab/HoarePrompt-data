Correctness: **False**

The function `func_9` does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description. 

One such case is when `n` is equal to `k + 1`. In this case, the function is supposed to return a range from 1 to k - 1, followed by k and k - 1. However, the current implementation of the function does not accurately handle this case. 

Therefore, since the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, the correctness of the code is **False**.
