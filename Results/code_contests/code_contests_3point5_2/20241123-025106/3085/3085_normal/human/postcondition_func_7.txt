Functionality: The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, a positive integer less than or equal to the length of `arr`. It calculates the inversion count of the list `arr` using a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) data structure and returns the final value of 'invcount' after all iterations. The function iterates over the list in reverse order, updating the inversion count and the BIT structure accordingly. The functionality is accurate based on the provided code and annotations.
