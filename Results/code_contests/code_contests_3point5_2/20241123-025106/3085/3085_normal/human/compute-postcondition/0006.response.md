Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range starting from 1 to k + 1. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the function does not modify any variable. In the case where `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range starting from 1 to k - 1, followed by k and k - 1.***
