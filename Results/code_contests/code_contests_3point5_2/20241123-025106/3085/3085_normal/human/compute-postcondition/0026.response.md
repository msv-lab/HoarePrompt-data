The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. The function works with two positive integers `n` and `k` where `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. 

In Case 1, if `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range starting from 1 to k + 1. In all other cases, the function does not modify any variable.

In Case 2, if `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range starting from 1 to k + 1. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the function does not modify any variable. In the case where `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range starting from 1 to k - 1, followed by k and k - 1.

In Case 3, if `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range from 1 to k + 1. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a list `ans` where `ans[i - 1]` is assigned k and `ans[k - 1]` is assigned the last value of i after the loop executes.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to work with two positive integers `n` and `k` such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`, and return different outcomes based on the relationships between `n` and `k`.
