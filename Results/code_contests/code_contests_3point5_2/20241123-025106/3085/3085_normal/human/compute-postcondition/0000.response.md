Example Answer:
The function `func_2()` returns two positive integers `n` and `k`. Given the precondition that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`, the values of `n` and `k` will satisfy these conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5**.
