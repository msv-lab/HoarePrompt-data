Output State: 
If `n` is equal to `k`, the loop will not execute, and the function will return a range from 1 to k + 1. 
If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `a[k - 1]` will be assigned the last value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` will be assigned k, `a[k]` will be assigned k, and `curInv` will be the result of `func_8(a, n)`. 
If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function will return a list `ans` ranging from 1 to `k` where `ans[k - 1]` is assigned the last value of `i` and `ans[i - 1]` is assigned k.
Output State: **If n is equal to k, function returns a range from 1 to k + 1. If n is equal to k + 1, the function returns a list ans where ans[i - 1] is assigned k and ans[k - 1] is assigned the last value of i after the loop executes.**
