Since the loop executes based on the range `xrange(2 * k - n, k)`, the next value of `i` will be the current value + 1. `a[k - 1]` is then assigned this next value of `i`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where `k â‰¤ n < 2k`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` is incremented to the next value in the range `xrange(2 * k - n, k) + 1`, `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, `curInv` is updated based on the modified `a` array after the assignment of `i`**
