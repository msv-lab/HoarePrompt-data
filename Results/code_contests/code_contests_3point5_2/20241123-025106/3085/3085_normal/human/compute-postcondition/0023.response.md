Example Answer:
`a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is incremented to the next value in the range `xrange(2 * k - n, k) + 1`. `a[k - 1]` is updated with the new value of `i`. The value of `curInv` is updated based on the modified `a` array after the assignment of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers where `k ≤ n < 2k`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` is incremented to the next value in the range `xrange(2 * k - n, k) + 1`, `a[k - 1]` is assigned the new value of `i`, `curInv` is updated based on the modified `a` array after the assignment of `i`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where `k ≤ n < 2k`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` is incremented to the next value in the range `xrange(2 * k - n, k) + 1`, `a[k - 1]` is assigned the new value of `i`, `curInv` is updated based on the modified `a` array after the assignment of `i`**
