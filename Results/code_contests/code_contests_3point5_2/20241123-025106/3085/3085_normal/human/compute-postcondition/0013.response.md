Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where `k â‰¤ n < 2k`, `2 * k - n` is less than `k`, `i` starts from the first value in the range `xrange(2 * k - n, k)`, `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, `a[k - 2]` is assigned the value of `k`, `a[k]` is assigned the value of `k`, and `curInv` is the result of `func_8(a, n)`**
