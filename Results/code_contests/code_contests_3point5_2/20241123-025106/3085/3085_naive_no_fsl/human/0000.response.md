Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines functions to handle input, calculate inversions, and generate the lexicographically maximum permutation.
2. The main function func_9 handles the logic to generate the permutation based on the given constraints and calculates inversions using the func_8 function.
3. The program iterates through the test cases and prints the generated permutations.
4. The program seems to follow the problem description and logic provided. 
5. It covers different scenarios such as when n equals k, n equals k+1, and general cases and generates the permutation accordingly.
6. Without finding a specific case where the program fails to meet the requirements, we can conclude that the program is correct.
