Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The code has syntax errors and missing closing parentheses, making it incomplete and erroneous. Additionally, the code is not handling all the possible cases as described in the problem description. For example, the code does not account for the fact that February has fewer than 30 days, so the calculation for saving candies on the 30th day of each month is incorrect. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
