Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of subtracting the integer value of `binary` from `prev`, and then takes the modulo 256 of the result. Since no specific values are provided for `table`, `prev`, `input`, `c`, `integer`, or `binary`, we cannot determine the exact output. Therefore, the output state is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2**
