Example Answer:
The character `c` is converted to its ASCII value, then converted to binary format with 8 bits. The resulting binary string is formatted to have leading zeros if needed. The value of `s` will be a string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 1 character, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is a string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits**
