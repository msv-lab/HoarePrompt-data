Example Answer:
The variable `integer` is assigned the integer value of `binary` in base 2. The value of `binary` is the reverse of `s`, which is a string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits. Therefore, the Output State is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is the string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, and `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is the string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, and `binary` is the reverse of `s`**
