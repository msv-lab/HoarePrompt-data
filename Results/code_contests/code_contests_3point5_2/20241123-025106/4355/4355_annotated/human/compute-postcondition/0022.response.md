Output State: **The loop calculates the difference between the previous integer value in base 2 and the current integer value in base 2 for each character in the input. The `table` dictionary maps characters to integers, `prev` holds the integer value of the current binary value, `input` contains characters to be processed, `c` represents the current character being processed, `integer` holds the integer value of the current binary value, `s` is a string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, `binary` is the reverse of `s`. If the input is empty, the loop does not execute, and `prev` remains 0.**
