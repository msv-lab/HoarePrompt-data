Example Answer:
The code converts the ASCII value of the next character in the input `c` to binary, pads it with zeros to make it 8 bits long, and then stores the reversed binary value in `s`. The variables `table`, `prev`, and `input` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is the string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is the string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, `binary` is the reverse of `s`**
