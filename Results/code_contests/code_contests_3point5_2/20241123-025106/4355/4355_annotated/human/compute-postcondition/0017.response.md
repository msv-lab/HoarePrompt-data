Example Answer:
The variable `binary` is assigned the value of `s` reversed. This means `binary` will now be the reverse of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is the string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, and `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is the string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, and `binary` is the reverse of `s`**
