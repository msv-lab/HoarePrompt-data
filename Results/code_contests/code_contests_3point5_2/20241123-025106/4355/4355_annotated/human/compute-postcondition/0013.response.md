Example Answer: 
The code subtracts `integer` from `prev` and calculates the remainder after division by 256. The value of `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, and the value of `integer` is also the integer value of `binary` in base 2. Therefore, `prev - integer` results in 0. When calculating the remainder after division by 256, the result is still 0. Hence, the Output State is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 1 character, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is a string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 1 character, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is a string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, `binary` is the reverse of `s`**
