Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value 0. The dictionary `table` mapping characters to integers remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0**
