Example Answer:
The character `c` is converted to its ASCII value, then to binary format and zero-padded to a length of 8. The initial state variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`**
