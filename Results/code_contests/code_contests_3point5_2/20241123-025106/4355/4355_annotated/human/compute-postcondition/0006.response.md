Example Answer:
The `binary` is the reverse of the input string `s`, and `integer` is assigned the integer value of `binary` in base 2. The previous values are that `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`. After converting `binary` to an integer in base 2, the output state is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2**
