According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input`. If the `input` has more characters, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `input` must have more characters, and `c` must be the next character in the `input`.
State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 1 character, `c` is the next character in the `input`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2**
