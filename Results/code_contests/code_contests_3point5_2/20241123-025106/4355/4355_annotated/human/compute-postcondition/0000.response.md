Example Answer:
The dictionary `table` is defined with keys `'>'`, `'<'`, `'+`, `'-'`, `'.', `','`, `'[', and `']'`, each corresponding to integer values 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively. The previous state is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers**
