Example Answer: 
The expression `prev - integer` is evaluated and then the result is taken modulo 256. The values of `prev` and `integer` are subtracted, and then the result is taken modulo 256. The initial state of `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, and the initial state of `integer` is also the integer value of `binary` in base 2. Therefore, the output state is: `table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is the string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, and `binary` is the reverse of `s`
Output State: **`table` is a dictionary mapping characters to integers, `prev` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `input` has more than 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the `input`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, `s` is the string representing the binary value of the ASCII value of character `c` with 8 bits, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and the result of `print(prev - integer) % 256` is kept**
