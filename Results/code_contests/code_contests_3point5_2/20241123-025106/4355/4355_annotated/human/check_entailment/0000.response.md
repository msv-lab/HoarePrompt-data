Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input text and processes each character according to the described method.
2. It calculates the integer values based on the ASCII values of the characters, reverses the binary representation, and prints the difference between the previous integer value and the current integer value modulo 256.
3. The program uses the correct logic to convert the text back to the initial array by applying the steps mentioned in the problem description.
4. The program handles the case when the input is empty by not executing the loop and keeping the initial value as 0.
5. There are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
