Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the described method for converting an array of unsigned 8-bit integers into a sequence of characters using the Turing Tape method. The program does not output the initial array used to produce the given text as described in the problem statement. Instead, it calculates and outputs the difference between the ASCII code of the characters in the input text, which does not match the specified process. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
