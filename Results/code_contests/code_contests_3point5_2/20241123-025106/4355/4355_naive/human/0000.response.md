Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the described method of restoring the initial array used to produce the given text. The program does not reverse the binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character in step 1 and does not reverse the binary notation of the result of the previous step in step 3. Additionally, the program does not handle the modulo operation as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
