Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The code reads a line of input and processes each character in the input string by converting it to a binary representation, calculating the decimal value of the binary, and printing the result of `(prev - integer) % 256`. However, it does not take into account the steps mentioned in the problem description to restore the initial array used to produce the text. The code lacks the logic to reverse the binary notations of ASCII codes and subtract the previous result from the current element to produce the initial array. Therefore, the code is incorrect in this case.
