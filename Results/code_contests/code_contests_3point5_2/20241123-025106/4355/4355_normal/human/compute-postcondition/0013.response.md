Example Answer:
The program calculates (prev - integer) % 256 and prints the result. The value of prev is an integer, and the value of integer is the decimal value of binary, which is the reverse of s, the formatted binary representation of the ASCII value of the second character in the input string. Therefore, the output state is: table is initialized with key-value pairs for the specified characters and integers, prev is the value of integer, input has at least 2 characters, c is the second character in the input, s is the formatted binary representation of the ASCII value of c with a minimum width of 8 characters, binary is the reverse of s, integer is the decimal value of binary converted from binary to an integer, and the program prints the result of (0 - integer) % 256.
