According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters remaining in the `input` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `input` has at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character in the input. To execute the loop one more time, the `input` should have at least 4 characters, and `c` should now be the fourth character in the input. No other states need adjustment for the next iteration.
State: **table is initialized with key-value pairs for the specified characters and integers, prev is the value of integer, input has at least 4 characters, c is the fourth character in the input, s is the formatted binary representation of the ASCII value of c with a minimum width of 8 characters, binary is the reverse of s, integer is the decimal value of binary converted from binary to an integer, and the result of (prev - integer) % 256 is printed**
