According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input`. If the input has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `table` dictionary is initialized does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the `input` has at least 1 character, and `c` is the first character in the `input`.
State: **`table` is initialized with key-value pairs for the specified characters and integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`**
