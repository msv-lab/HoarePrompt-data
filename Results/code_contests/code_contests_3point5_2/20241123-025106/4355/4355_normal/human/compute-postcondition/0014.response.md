Example Answer: 
`prev` is assigned the value of `integer`, and the previous value of `integer` is unknown, so the output state is: table is initialized with key-value pairs for the specified characters and integers, prev is the value of integer, input has at least 2 characters, c is the second character in the input, s is the formatted binary representation of the ASCII value of c with a minimum width of 8 characters, binary is the reverse of s, integer is the decimal value of binary converted from binary to an integer, and the program prints the result of (0 - integer) % 256.
