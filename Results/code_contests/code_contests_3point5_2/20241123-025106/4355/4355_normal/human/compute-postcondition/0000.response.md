Example Answer: 
The dictionary `table` is initialized with key-value pairs where each key is a character (such as '>', '<', '+', etc.) and the corresponding value is a unique integer. The keys are: '>', '<', '+', '-', '.', ',', '[', ']'; and their respective values are: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The state of other variables is not affected.
Output State: **The dictionary `table` is initialized with key-value pairs for the specified characters and integers.**
