Example Answer:
The character `c` is converted to its ASCII value using `ord(c)`, then converted to binary using `bin(ord(c))`. The resulting binary string is formatted to have a minimum width of 8 characters, padding with 0s if necessary. The formatted binary string is then assigned to variable `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `table` is initialized with key-value pairs for the specified characters and integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`, `s` is the formatted binary representation of the ASCII value of `c` with a minimum width of 8 characters.
Output State: **`table` is initialized with key-value pairs for the specified characters and integers, `prev` is 0, `input` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the `input`, `s` is the formatted binary representation of the ASCII value of `c` with a minimum width of 8 characters**
