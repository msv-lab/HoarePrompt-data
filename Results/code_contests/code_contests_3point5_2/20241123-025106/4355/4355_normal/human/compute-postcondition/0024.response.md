Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, processes each character in the input string by converting it to a binary representation, calculating the decimal value of the binary, and printing the result of (prev - integer) % 256. If the input is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and prev remains 0. The function lacks explicit return values or side effects outside of printing.**
