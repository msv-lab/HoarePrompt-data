Example Answer:
The code formats the binary representation of the ASCII value of the third character in the input with a minimum width of 8 characters and assigns it to variable s. The previous values of the affected variables are used to calculate the binary representation and the decimal value of the binary. Finally, the program prints the result of (0 - integer) % 256. 
Output State: **table is initialized with key-value pairs for the specified characters and integers, prev is the value of integer, input has at least 3 characters, c is the third character in the input, s is the formatted binary representation of the ASCII value of c with a minimum width of 8 characters, binary is the reverse of s, integer is the decimal value of binary converted from binary to an integer, and the program prints the result of (0 - integer) % 256**
