According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res + i + 1` and returns. Otherwise, no action is taken. 

Since all variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, and there are no specific conditions mentioned for adjusting the states to continue the loop, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: *All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships*
