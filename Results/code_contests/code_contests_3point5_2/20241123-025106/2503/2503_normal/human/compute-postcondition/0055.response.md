According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. So, to execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than or equal to 3, x1, y1, x2, y2, s, pref_sums, u, r, new_x, new_y, dist, remain the same**
