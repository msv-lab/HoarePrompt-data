The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It operates based on the predefined constraints and relationships provided in the description. The function involves multiple cases with specific conditions and operations based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, and `s`. The function performs various calculations, updates variables, and prints certain values based on the conditions met during execution. It handles edge cases and ensures that the program behaves as expected in different scenarios. The function does not have a direct return value but prints certain values or exits under specific conditions as described in each case. Overall, the function `func_2` is a complex algorithm that navigates through different scenarios based on the input constraints and relationships to perform specific actions.
