Postcondition: ***All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships. If the absolute difference between x1 and x2 plus the absolute difference between y1 and y2 minus the product of n and cycles is less than or equal to 0, the program prints res and returns. Otherwise, the program does nothing. This condition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if else block executes.***
