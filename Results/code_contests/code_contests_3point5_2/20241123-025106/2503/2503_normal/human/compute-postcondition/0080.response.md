According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships. `i` is incremented by 1, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is one more than the previous value.
State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, `i` is one more than the previous value, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]**
