Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are non-negative integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program prints 0 and returns. In all other cases, the program does not return anything. `n` is an input integer, `s` is assigned the input string value, `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size `n` with each element initialized to `[0, 0]`, `u` is -1, and `r` is 0. The first character of `s` is 'D'.**
