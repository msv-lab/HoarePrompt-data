Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes no explicit parameters and operates based on user input. It reads integer coordinates `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and a sequence of characters `s`. The function then calculates movements based on the characters in `s` and prints specific values based on conditions. 

The function first checks if `x1` and `y1` are equal to `x2` and `y2`, in which case it prints 0 and returns. If they are not equal, it proceeds to process the input string `s` character by character, updating position values accordingly.

It then calculates distances and checks if certain conditions are met, printing different values or returning based on those conditions. The function handles edge cases where specific characters in `s` lead to immediate prints or early exits.

The function performs multiple calculations and updates variables based on the input constraints, navigating through different scenarios to print values or exit under specific conditions. **
