You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**:
- x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9.
- x1, y1 ≠ x2, y2.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- s is a string of length n, consisting only of letters U, D, L, and R.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are non-negative integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program prints 0 and returns. In all other cases, the program does not return anything.

Case_2: *`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are non-negative integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program prints 0 and returns. In all other cases, the program does not return anything. `n` is an input integer, `s` is assigned the input string value, `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size `n` with each element initialized to `[0, 0]`, `u` is either 1 if the first character of `s` is 'U' or -1 if the first character of `s` is 'D', and `r` is 1 if the first character of `s` is 'R', otherwise it remains 0. After the execution of the if block, the first character of `s` is 'L', and `r` is -1, `pref_sums[0]` is updated to `[r, u]`. `new_x` is assigned the value of `x1 + r`, and `new_y` is assigned the value of `y1 + u`. `dist` is calculated as the absolute difference between `new_x` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `new_y` and `y2`, then subtracting 1. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1.

Case_3: n is greater than or equal to 1, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers, s is assigned the input string value, pref_sums is a 2D list of size n with each element initialized to [0, 0], u is either 1 if the first character of s is 'U' or -1 if the first character of s is 'D', r is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'L', otherwise it remains as assigned before, pref_sums[0] is updated to [-1, -1], new_x is assigned the value of x1 - 1, new_y is assigned the value of y1 - 1, dist is calculated as the absolute difference between new_x and x2 plus the absolute difference between new_y and y2, then subtracting i and 1, u is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'D', otherwise u remains as assigned before, r is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'L', and r is set to 1 if the character at index i in string s is 'R', pref_sums[i] is updated according to the given formula, new_x, new_y are updated based on the formula provided. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints i + 1 and exits. All variables retain their initial conditions and relationships, taking into account all possible edge cases.

Case_4: *n >= 1, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers, s is a string input, pref_sums is a 2D list of size n initialized to [0, 0], u is 1 if the first character of s is 'U' or -1 if the first character of s is 'D', r is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'L', otherwise remains as assigned, pref_sums[0] is [-1, -1], new_x is x1 - 1, new_y is y1 - 1, dist is the absolute difference between new_x and x2 plus the absolute difference between new_y and y2, then subtracted by i and 1, u is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'D', otherwise remains as assigned, r is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'L', r is 1 if the character at index i in string s is 'R', pref_sums[i] is updated based on a given formula, new_x, new_y are updated accordingly. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints i + 1 and exits. All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, accounting for all possible edge cases.

Case_5: *All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships. If the absolute difference between x1 and x2 plus the absolute difference between y1 and y2 minus the product of n and cycles is less than or equal to 0, the program prints res and returns. Otherwise, the program does nothing. This condition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if else block executes.

Case_6: If the absolute difference between x1 and x2 plus the absolute difference between y1 and y2 minus the product of n and cycles is less than or equal to 0, the program prints res + i + 1 and returns. Otherwise, no action is taken. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute.

Case_7: No action is taken

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
