Postcondition: ***n >= 1, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers, s is a string input, pref_sums is a 2D list of size n initialized to [0, 0], u is 1 if the first character of s is 'U' or -1 if the first character of s is 'D', r is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'L', otherwise remains as assigned, pref_sums[0] is [-1, -1], new_x is x1 - 1, new_y is y1 - 1, dist is the absolute difference between new_x and x2 plus the absolute difference between new_y and y2, then subtracted by i and 1, u is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'D', otherwise remains as assigned, r is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'L', r is 1 if the character at index i in string s is 'R', pref_sums[i] is updated based on a given formula, new_x, new_y are updated accordingly. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints i + 1 and exits. All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, accounting for all possible edge cases.***
