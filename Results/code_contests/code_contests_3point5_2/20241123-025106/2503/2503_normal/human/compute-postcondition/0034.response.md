Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to 1, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers, s is assigned the input string value, pref_sums is a 2D list of size n with each element initialized to [0, 0], u is either 1 if the first character of s is 'U' or -1 if the first character of s is 'D', r is 1 if the first character of s is 'R' or -1 if the first character of s is 'L', pref_sums[0] is updated to [-1, -1], new_x is assigned the value of x1 - 1, new_y is assigned the value of y1 - 1, dist is calculated as the absolute difference between new_x and x2 plus the absolute difference between new_y and y2, then subtracting 1, u and r are both assigned the value of 0 if the first character of s is 'U', otherwise they remain 0.***
