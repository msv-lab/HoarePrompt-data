According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, n needs to be adjusted to n is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than or equal to 2, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers, s is assigned the input string value, pref_sums is a 2D list of size n with each element initialized to [0, 0], u is either 1 if the first character of s is 'U' or -1 if the first character of s is 'D', r is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'L', otherwise it remains as assigned before, pref_sums[0] is updated to [-1, -1], new_x is assigned the value of x1 - 1, new_y is assigned the value of y1 - 1, dist is calculated as the absolute difference between new_x and x2 plus the absolute difference between new_y and y2, then subtracting i and 1, u is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'D', otherwise u remains as assigned before, r is -1 if the character at index i in string s is 'L', and r is set to 1 if the character at index i in string s is 'R', pref_sums[i] is updated according to the given formula, new_x, new_y are updated based on the formula provided. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints i + 1 and exits. All variables retain their initial conditions and relationships, taking into account all possible edge cases.**
