Example Answer: 
`new_x` is assigned the value of `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `new_y` is assigned the value of `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `pref_sums[i][0]`, and `pref_sums[i][1]` are not provided, so the output state is: All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, the condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles`, and `res` has been evaluated, `new_x` is assigned a new value, `new_y` is assigned a new value.
Output State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, the condition involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles`, and `res` has been evaluated, `new_x` is assigned a new value, `new_y` is assigned a new value**
