Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are non-negative integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program prints 0 and returns. In all other cases, the program does not return anything. `n` is an input integer, `s` is assigned the input string value, `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size `n` with each element initialized to `[0, 0]`, `u` is either 1 if the first character of `s` is 'U' or -1 if the first character of `s` is 'D', and `r` is 1 if the first character of `s` is 'R', otherwise it remains 0. After the execution of the if block, the first character of `s` is 'L', and `r` is -1, `pref_sums[0]` is updated to `[r, u]`. `new_x` is assigned the value of `x1 + r`, and `new_y` is assigned the value of `y1 + u`. `dist` is calculated as the absolute difference between `new_x` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `new_y` and `y2`, then subtracting 1.***
