According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships. For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, `i` is incremented by 1**
