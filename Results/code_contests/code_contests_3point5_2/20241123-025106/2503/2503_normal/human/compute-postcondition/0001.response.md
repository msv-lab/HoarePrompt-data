Example Answer:
`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `x1` and `y1` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1` is a non-negative integer, `y1` is a non-negative integer, `x2` and `y2` are assigned integers from input after splitting.
Output State: **`x1` is a non-negative integer, `y1` is a non-negative integer, `x2` and `y2` are assigned integers from input after splitting**
