Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `n` multiplied by `cycles`. The previous values of `n` and `cycles` are unknown, so the result depends on their specific values. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, accounting for all possible edge cases.
Output State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, accounting for all possible edge cases**
