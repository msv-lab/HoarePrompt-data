Example Answer:
`x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from the input after splitting by space. The values of `x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1` is a non-negative integer, `y1` is a non-negative integer. 
Output State: **`x1` is a non-negative integer, `y1` is a non-negative integer**
