Example Answer: 
`new_x` is assigned the value of `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `new_y` is assigned the value of `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, `i` is incremented by 1, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`.
Output State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, `i` is incremented by 1, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]**
