Example Answer: 
`x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]` and `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`. The values of `cycles` and `pref_sums` are unknown, so the updated values of `x1` and `y1` cannot be determined accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, accounting for all possible edge cases.
Output State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, accounting for all possible edge cases**
