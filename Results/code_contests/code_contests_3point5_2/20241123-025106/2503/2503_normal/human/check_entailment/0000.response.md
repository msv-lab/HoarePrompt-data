Correctness: **False**

The code does not always follow the problem description. One potential case where the code does not work correctly is when the ship is required to stay in place for a certain number of days to reach the destination point, but the code does not account for this scenario correctly. The output hints do not provide a concrete example of this case, but based on the code logic, it seems that the program might not handle the scenario where the ship needs to stay in place to align with the wind direction.
