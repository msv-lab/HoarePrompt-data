Example Answer:
`u` and `r` are assigned the values 0. The previous values of all elements in `pref_sums` are already 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0, `u` is 0, `r` is 0.
Output State: **`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
