Output State: **`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with updated values, `u` and `r` are set based on the characters in `s`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated, `i` is the index of the loop, `n` is the total size of the loop, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on calculations, `dist` is the difference between new_x, new_y, x2, and y2. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints i + 1 and returns.**
