Postcondition: ***x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers where x1 != x2 or y1 != y2. n is a positive integer and s is a string of length n consisting of only 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'. If x1 is equal to x2 and y1 is equal to y2, the program prints 0 and returns without any change in the variables. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, n, and s after the execution of the if else block.***
