Output State: **The loop calculates the new coordinates based on pref_sums, checks if the distance is less than or equal to 0, and prints res + i + 1. If the condition is not met, no further action is taken. Variables are updated accordingly during each iteration. If the absolute difference between x1 and x2 plus the absolute difference between y1 and y2 minus n times cycles is greater than 0, the loop does not execute.**
