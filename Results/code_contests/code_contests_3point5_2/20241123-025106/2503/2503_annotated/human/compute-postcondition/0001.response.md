Example Answer:
x2, y2 are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. The initial values of x1, y1 are unknown, and n is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: x1, y1 are non-negative integers such that x_1 != x_2 or y_1 != y_2; n is a positive integer; s is a string of length n consisting of only 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.
Output State: **x1, y1 are non-negative integers such that x_1 != x_2 or y_1 != y_2; n is a positive integer; s is a string of length n consisting of only 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'**
