Postcondition: ***`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0. `u` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `s` is 'U'. If the first element of `s` is 'R', `r` is set to 1. If the first element of `s` is 'D', `u` is set to -1. If the first element of `s` is 'L', `r` is set to -1. The overall state of the program after the if statement execution covers all cases where `s` starts with 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L', ensuring that the correct values are assigned to `u`, `r`, and `pref_sums` accordingly.***
