Example Answer:
The variable `dist` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `new_x - x2` and `new_y - y2`, and then subtracts 1 from it. The values of `new_x`, `x2`, `new_y`, and `y2` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `dist` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the output state is: `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0, `u` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `s` is 'U', `r` is set to 1 if the first element of `s` is 'R', `u` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'D', and `r` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'L'.
Output State: **`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0, `u` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `s` is 'U', `r` is set to 1 if the first element of `s` is 'R', `u` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'D', and `r` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'L'**
