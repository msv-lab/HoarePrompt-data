Example Answer:
`new_x` is assigned the value `x1 + r`, and `new_y` is assigned the value `y1 + u`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `r`, and `u` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0, `u` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `s` is 'U', `r` is set to 1 if the first element of `s` is 'R', `u` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'D', and `r` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'L'.
Output State: **`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0, `u` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `s` is 'U', `r` is set to 1 if the first element of `s` is 'R', `u` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'D', and `r` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'L'**
