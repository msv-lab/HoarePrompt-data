Output State: **`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with updated values, `u` and `r` are set based on the characters in `s`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated, `i` is the index of the loop, `n` is the total size of the loop, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on calculations. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints i + 1 and returns, and `res` is assigned the value of n * cycles**
