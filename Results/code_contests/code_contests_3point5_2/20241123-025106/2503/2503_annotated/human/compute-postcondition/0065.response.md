Postcondition: ***`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with updated values, `u` and `r` are set based on the characters in `s`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated, `i` is the index of the loop, `n` is the total size of the loop, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on calculations, `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, i + 1 is printed and returned, `res` is assigned the value of n * cycles, `x1` and `y1` are updated by adding cycles times the last elements of `pref_sums` to their respective values, and the absolute difference between x1 and x2 plus the absolute difference between y1 and y2 minus n times cycles is less than or equal to 0***
