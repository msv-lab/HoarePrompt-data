According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 1. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.
State: **`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with updated values, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `min_dist` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 1, `new_x` is the sum of x1 and the first element of the list at index i in `pref_sums`, `new_y` is the sum of y1 and the second element of the list at index i in `pref_sums`, `dist` is the absolute difference between new_x and x2 plus the absolute difference between new_y and y2 minus i minus 1**
