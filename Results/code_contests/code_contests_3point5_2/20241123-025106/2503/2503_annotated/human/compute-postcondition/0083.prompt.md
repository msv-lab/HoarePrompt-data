You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 are non-negative integers such that x_1 != x_2 or y_1 != y_2. n is a positive integer. s is a string of length n consisting of only 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.**
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers where x1 != x2 or y1 != y2. n is a positive integer and s is a string of length n consisting of only 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'. If x1 is equal to x2 and y1 is equal to y2, the program prints 0 and returns without any change in the variables. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, n, and s after the execution of the if else block.

Case_2: *`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0. `u` is either 0 or 1 based on the first element of `s`, where `u` is set to 0 if the first element is 'R' or 'D', and `u` is set to 1 if the first element is 'U' or 'L'. `r` is set to 1 if the first element of `s` is 'R', and `r` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'L'. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1 and returns.

Case_3: `pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with updated values, `u` and `r` are set based on the characters in `s`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated, `i` is the index of the loop, `n` is the total size of the loop, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on calculations, `dist` is the difference between new_x, new_y, x2, and y2. If dist is less than or equal to 0, the program prints i + 1 and returns.

Case_4: *`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with updated values, `u` and `r` are set based on the characters in `s`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated, `i` is the index of the loop, `n` is the total size of the loop, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on calculations. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints i + 1 and returns. All variables retain their initial values and relationships, with the additional condition that if `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the program proceeds with the next part of the loop without altering any variables.

Case_5: *`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with updated values, `u` and `r` are set based on the characters in `s`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated, `i` is the index of the loop, `n` is the total size of the loop, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on calculations, `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0. If the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus n times `cycles` is less than or equal to 0, then the function prints and returns i + 1. Otherwise, no further action is taken. The values of `res`, `x1`, and `y1` may be updated based on the program's flow.

Case_6: The loop calculates the new coordinates based on pref_sums, checks if the distance is less than or equal to 0, and prints res + i + 1. If the condition is not met, no further action is taken. Variables are updated accordingly during each iteration. If the absolute difference between x1 and x2 plus the absolute difference between y1 and y2 minus n times cycles is greater than 0, the loop does not execute.

Case_7: The loop does not execute

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
