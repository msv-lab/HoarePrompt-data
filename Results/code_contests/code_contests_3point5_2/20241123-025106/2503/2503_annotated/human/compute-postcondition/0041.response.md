Postcondition: ***`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0. `u` is either 1 or -1 based on the character at index `i` in the list `s`. If the character at index `i` in the list `s` is 'U', then `u` is set to 1. `r` is set to 1 if the character at index `i` in the list `s` is 'R', otherwise it remains 0. `min_dist` is 0, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. The character at index `i` in the list `s` is 'L'.***
