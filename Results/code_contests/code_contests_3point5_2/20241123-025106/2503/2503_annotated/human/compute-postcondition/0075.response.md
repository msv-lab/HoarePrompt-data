Postcondition: ***`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with updated values, `u` and `r` are set based on the characters in `s`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated based on calculations, `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2` plus the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` minus n times `cycles` is less than or equal to 0, `res`, `x1`, and `y1` may be updated based on the program's flow. After the execution of the program fragment, if `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints the value of `res + i + 1`. All variables retain their initial conditions with potential updates to `res`, `x1`, and `y1` based on the program's logic.***
