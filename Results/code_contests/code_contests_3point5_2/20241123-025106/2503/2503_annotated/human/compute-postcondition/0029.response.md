Output State: **`pref_sums` is a 2D list of size n x 2 with all elements set to 0, `u` is either 0 or 1 based on the first element of `s`, where `u` is set to 0 if the first element is 'R' or 'D', and `u` is set to 1 if the first element is 'U' or 'L', `r` is set to 1 if the first element of `s` is 'R', and `r` is set to -1 if the first element of `s` is 'L', if `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1 and returns, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`**
