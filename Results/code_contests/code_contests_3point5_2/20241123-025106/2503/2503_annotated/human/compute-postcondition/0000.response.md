Example Answer:
x1, y1 are assigned values based on the input using map and split. The values of x1 and y1 are non-negative integers, so they take the input values as is. The other variables x2, y2, n, and s remain unaffected.
Output State: **x1, y1 are non-negative integers such that x_1 != x_2 or y_1 != y_2. n is a positive integer. s is a string of length n consisting of only 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.**
