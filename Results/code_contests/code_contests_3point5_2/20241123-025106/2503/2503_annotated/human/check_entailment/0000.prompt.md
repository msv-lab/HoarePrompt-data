You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You a captain of a ship. Initially you are standing in a point (x_1, y_1) (obviously, all positions in the sea can be described by cartesian plane) and you want to travel to a point (x_2, y_2). 

You know the weather forecast — the string s of length n, consisting only of letters U, D, L and R. The letter corresponds to a direction of wind. Moreover, the forecast is periodic, e.g. the first day wind blows to the side s_1, the second day — s_2, the n-th day — s_n and (n+1)-th day — s_1 again and so on. 

Ship coordinates change the following way:

  * if wind blows the direction U, then the ship moves from (x, y) to (x, y + 1); 
  * if wind blows the direction D, then the ship moves from (x, y) to (x, y - 1); 
  * if wind blows the direction L, then the ship moves from (x, y) to (x - 1, y); 
  * if wind blows the direction R, then the ship moves from (x, y) to (x + 1, y). 



The ship can also either go one of the four directions or stay in place each day. If it goes then it's exactly 1 unit of distance. Transpositions of the ship and the wind add up. If the ship stays in place, then only the direction of wind counts. For example, if wind blows the direction U and the ship moves the direction L, then from point (x, y) it will move to the point (x - 1, y + 1), and if it goes the direction U, then it will move to the point (x, y + 2).

You task is to determine the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point (x_2, y_2).

Input

The first line contains two integers x_1, y_1 (0 ≤ x_1, y_1 ≤ 10^9) — the initial coordinates of the ship.

The second line contains two integers x_2, y_2 (0 ≤ x_2, y_2 ≤ 10^9) — the coordinates of the destination point.

It is guaranteed that the initial coordinates and destination point coordinates are different.

The third line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the string s.

The fourth line contains the string s itself, consisting only of letters U, D, L and R.

Output

The only line should contain the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point (x_2, y_2).

If it's impossible then print "-1".

Note

In the first example the ship should perform the following sequence of moves: "RRRRU". Then its coordinates will change accordingly: (0, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 3) → (4, 4) → (4, 6).

In the second example the ship should perform the following sequence of moves: "DD" (the third day it should stay in place). Then its coordinates will change accordingly: (0, 3) → (0, 3) → (0, 1) → (0, 0).

In the third example the ship can never reach the point (0, 1).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
