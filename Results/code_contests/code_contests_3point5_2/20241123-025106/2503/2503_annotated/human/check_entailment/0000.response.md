Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the initial coordinates of the ship, the destination coordinates, the length of the string, and the string itself.
2. It calculates the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point as per the given rules.
3. The program covers all possible wind directions and adjusts the ship's movement accordingly.
4. It handles cases where the ship reaches the destination in a single day or if it's impossible to reach the destination.
5. The program efficiently calculates the minimal number of days required even for periodic wind forecasts.
6. The code logic follows the problem description accurately and handles all edge cases appropriately.
