The function `func_1` accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`. It achieves this by iteratively updating `x` and `y` until `y` becomes zero. If `y` is initially zero, the function returns the initial value of `x`. The function assumes the precondition 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
