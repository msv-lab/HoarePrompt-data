The function `func_2` reads input coordinates and a string of directions, calculates distances based on the directions, and prints specific values or messages based on conditions met during execution. It handles cases where the coordinates are equal, calculates distances between points, prints values based on distances, and manages loops for distance calculations. However, the annotations and actual code have discrepancies in the return statements, indicating that the code may not behave as described in the annotations. Potential edge cases and missing logic include scenarios where the program does not return as indicated in the annotations.
