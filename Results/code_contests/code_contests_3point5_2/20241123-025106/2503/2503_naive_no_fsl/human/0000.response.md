Correctness: True

Explanation: The program calculates the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the destination point (x2, y2) based on the given initial coordinates, destination coordinates, weather forecast, and periodicity of the forecast. It considers all possible scenarios of the ship moving in different directions based on the wind forecast and handles the cases where the ship reaches the destination or is unable to reach the destination. The logic and calculations in the program seem to align with the problem description, and there are no obvious cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
