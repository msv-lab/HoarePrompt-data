As a best engineer of the company he was assigned a task to develop a printer that will be able to print horizontal and vertical strips. First prototype is already built and Kris wants to tests it. He wants you to implement the program that checks the result of the printing.\n\nPrinter works with a rectangular sheet of paper of size n × m. Consider the list as a table consisting of n rows and m columns. Rows are numbered from top to bottom with integers from 1 to n, while columns are numbered from left to right with integers from 1 to m. Initially, all cells are painted in color 0.\n\nYour program has to support two operations: \n\n  1. Paint all cells in row ri in color ai; \n  2. Paint all cells in column ci in color ai. \n\n\n\nIf during some operation i there is a cell that have already been painted, the color of this cell also changes to ai.\n\nYour program has to print the resulting table after k operation.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n·m ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 000) — the dimensions of the sheet and the number of operations, respectively.\n\nEach of the next k lines contains the description of exactly one query: \n\n  * 1 ri ai (1 ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), means that row ri is painted in color ai; \n  * 2 ci ai (1 ≤ ci ≤ m, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), means that column ci is painted in color ai. \n\nOutput\n\nPrint n lines containing m integers each — the resulting table after all operations are applied.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3 3 3\n1 1 3\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n3 1 3 \n2 2 2 \n0 1 0 \n\n\nInput\n\n5 3 5\n1 1 1\n1 3 1\n1 5 1\n2 1 1\n2 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 1 1 \n1 0 1 \n1 1 1 \n1 0 1 \n1 1 1 \n\nNote\n\nThe figure below shows all three operations for the first sample step by step. The cells that were painted on the corresponding step are marked gray. \n\n<image>",

        "description": "It's hard times now. Today Petya needs to score 100 points on Informatics exam. The tasks seem easy to Petya, but he thinks he lacks time to finish them all, so he asks you to help with one..\n\nThere is a glob pattern in the statements (a string consisting of lowercase English letters, characters \"?\" and \"*\"). It is known that character \"*\" occurs no more than once in the pattern.\n\nAlso, n query strings are given, it is required to determine for each of them if the pattern matches it or not.\n\nEverything seemed easy to Petya, but then he discovered that the special pattern characters differ from their usual meaning.\n\nA pattern matches a string if it is possible to replace each character \"?\" with one good lowercase English letter, and the character \"*\" (if there is one) with any, including empty, string of bad lowercase English letters, so that the resulting string is the same as the given string.\n\nThe good letters are given to Petya. All the others are bad.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters. These letters are good letters, all the others are bad.\n\nThe second line contains the pattern — a string s of lowercase English letters, characters \"?\" and \"*\" (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105). It is guaranteed that character \"*\" occurs in s no more than once.\n\nThe third line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of query strings.\n\nn lines follow, each of them contains single non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters — a query string.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of all query strings is not greater than 105.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n lines: in the i-th of them print \"YES\" if the pattern matches the i-th query string, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\nab\na?a\n2\naaa\naab\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\nInput\n\nabc\na?a?a*\n4\nabacaba\nabaca\napapa\naaaaax\n\n\nOutput\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example we can replace \"?\" with good letters \"a\" and \"b\", so we can see that the answer for the first query is \"YES\", and the answer for the second query is \"NO\", because we can't match the third letter.\n\nExplanation of the second example. \n\n  * The first query: \"NO\", because character \"*\" can be replaced with a string of bad letters only, but the only way to match the query string is to replace it with the string \"ba\", in which both letters are good. \n  * The second query: \"YES\", because characters \"?\" can be replaced with corresponding good letters, and character \"*\" can be replaced with empty string, and the strings will coincide. \n  * The third query: \"NO\", because characters \"?\" can't be replaced with bad letters. \n  * The fourth query: \"YES\", because characters \"?\" can be replaced with good letters \"a\", and character \"*\" can be replaced with a string of bad letters \"x\".
