Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func()` does not take any input parameters. The interaction with the system is handled through standard input and output as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function will receive multiple test cases, each starting with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph. The function can then make up to `n` queries of the form "? d" (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) to gather information about the graph, and finally output a Hamiltonian path for each test case in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n". The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The lambda function `q` is defined to handle queries but has not been invoked.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
