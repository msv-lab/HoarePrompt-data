### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its annotations to determine if it correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

The key part of the problem is to understand how the array \( a \) is constructed from the permutation \( p \):

\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

This means that for each \( i \), \( a_i \) is the difference between the smallest non-negative integer not present in the first \( i \) elements of \( p \) and the \( i \)-th element of \( p \).

Let's break down the given code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is an empty list that will store the elements of the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` is supposed to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation, and `maxx` is supposed to keep track of the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list.

2. **Processing each element of `arr`**:
   - If `arr[i]` is positive, the code appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly determine the MEX value.
   - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the code appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the newly appended value is greater than `maxx`. This part is also flawed because it doesn't correctly determine the MEX value.

3. **Output**:
   - The code prints the elements of `mex` for each test case.

### Flaws in the Code:
- The logic for determining the MEX value is incorrect. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation, but the code does not correctly maintain this value.
- The handling of positive and non-positive values in `arr` does not correctly reflect the relationship between `a_i` and the MEX of the prefix of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each element in `arr`, determine the MEX of the current prefix of `p` and use it to compute the next element of `p`.
- Maintain a set or a boolean array to efficiently determine the MEX value.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:
The annotations provided do not challenge the original assessment but rather describe the state of the program without validating if the logic is correct. The annotations state the behavior of the program but do not address the correctness of the logic used to construct the permutation \( p \).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
