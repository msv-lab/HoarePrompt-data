You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes and prints a specific permutation of the list `a` based on certain rules. For each positive element in the list, it assigns the current minimum non-negative integer not yet used, and for each non-positive element, it computes the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum non-negative integer, updating the maximum value encountered. The function prints the resulting permutation for the given list `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

The key part of the problem is to understand how the array \( a \) is constructed from the permutation \( p \):

\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

This means that for each \( i \), \( a_i \) is the difference between the smallest non-negative integer not present in the first \( i \) elements of \( p \) and the \( i \)-th element of \( p \).

Let's break down the given code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is an empty list that will store the elements of the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` is supposed to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation, and `maxx` is supposed to keep track of the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list.

2. **Processing each element of `arr`**:
   - If `arr[i]` is positive, the code appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly determine the MEX value.
   - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the code appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the newly appended value is greater than `maxx`. This part is also flawed because it doesn't correctly determine the MEX value.

3. **Output**:
   - The code prints the elements of `mex` for each test case.

### Flaws in the Code:
- The logic for determining the MEX value is incorrect. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation, but the code does not correctly maintain this value.
- The handling of positive and non-positive values in `arr` does not correctly reflect the relationship between `a_i` and the MEX of the prefix of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each element in `arr`, determine the MEX of the current prefix of `p` and use it to compute the next element of `p`.
- Maintain a set or a boolean array to efficiently determine the MEX value.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
