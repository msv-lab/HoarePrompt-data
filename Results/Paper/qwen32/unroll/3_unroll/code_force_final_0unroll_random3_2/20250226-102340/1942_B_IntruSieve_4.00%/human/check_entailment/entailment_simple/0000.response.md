Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given constraints. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**:
   - The program uses `minn` to keep track of the smallest unused number, but it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation for all cases.
   - Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the MEX of a set of numbers can be any non-negative integer not in the set, not necessarily the smallest unused number in the sequence of `p` values constructed so far.

2. **Handling Negative Values in `a`**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when `arr[i]` is negative. The logic `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is not guaranteed to give the correct MEX value.

3. **Updating `minn` and `maxx`**:
   - The program increments `minn` every time a positive `arr[i]` is encountered, but it does not correctly handle the case where the MEX value should be larger than `minn` due to previously used numbers.
   - The variable `maxx` is not used effectively to ensure that the MEX calculation is correct.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a` as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
