You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case's list.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to move chips so that they form a single contiguous block with no free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required to achieve this needs to be calculated for each test case.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string of cells `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the left.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the right, which corresponds to the last chip in the original string.

3. **Calculating the Relevant Section:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` is intended to capture the substring from the first chip to the last chip. However, there is a mistake in this calculation:
     - `n - y` is not the correct index for the last chip in the original string. It should be `n - 1 - y` to correctly slice the string up to the last chip.
     - With the current implementation, `z` may not include the last chip or may include extra characters beyond the last chip.

4. **Counting Operations:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the substring `z`, which is intended to represent the minimum number of operations needed.

### Mistake in the Program

The main issue is in the calculation of `z`. The current implementation does not correctly identify the substring between the first and last chip, leading to incorrect counts of free cells.

### Correctness

Given the mistake in the calculation of the substring `z`, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations needed in all cases due to the incorrect slicing of the relevant section of the string.
