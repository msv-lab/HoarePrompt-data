Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case's list.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. The conditions for `n` and the list of integers remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
