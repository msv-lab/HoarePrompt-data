Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
  - Alice starts first.
  - Alice appends the chosen element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
  - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in an array.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   
2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - `cntl` is an array where `cntl[i]` stores the count of the number `i` in `a`.
   - This is done using a loop that increments the count for each element in `a`.

3. **Determining the MEX**:
   - If `cntl[0] == 0`, it means `0` is not in the array, so the MEX is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `c` to the minimum of `2` or `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can add at most two `0`s to `c` if they are available.
   - It then iterates through `cntl` starting from `1` to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j] < 2`, it means `j` appears less than twice in `a`.
     - Alice can add `j` to `c` if it appears at least once, and Bob can prevent it from being added if it appears more than once.
     - The variable `c` is decremented each time Alice can add a number to `c`.
     - If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, the loop breaks, and `j` is printed as the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for determining the MEX is based on the fact that Alice can add a number to `c` if it appears at least once and Bob can prevent it if it appears more than once.
- If `cntl[0] == 0`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is not in the array.
- If `cntl[0] > 0`, Alice can add at most two `0`s to `c` if they are available.
- For each subsequent number `j`, if `cntl[j] < 2`, Alice can add `j` to `c` and `c` is decremented.
- The loop breaks when `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, and `j` is printed as the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

**Correctness: True**
