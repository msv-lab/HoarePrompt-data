To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally according to the rules.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing and Counting Elements:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a list `cntl` where `cntl[i]` is the count of the number `i` in `a`.

2. **Determine the MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0] == 0`, it means there are no `0`s in the array `a`. Since Alice always starts and can choose any element, she can ensure that `c` never contains a `0`, making the MEX `0`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s in `a`. This `c` variable seems to be tracking the number of `0`s that can be placed in `c` by Alice.
   - The program then iterates over each possible number `j` from `1` to `n`.
     - If the count of `j` in `a` is less than `2`, it decrements `c` by `1` (indicating that Bob will take one of the occurrences of `j`).
     - If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

### Potential Issues:

- **Logic for Determining MEX:**
  - The logic for determining the MEX seems flawed. The variable `c` is not correctly representing the state of the game or the MEX calculation.
  - The decrement of `c` by `1` when `cntl[j] < 2` does not directly correlate with the MEX calculation.
  - The condition `if not c or j == n` is not a robust way to determine the MEX.

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob is not correctly implemented. Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, while Bob should aim to minimize it. However, the current logic does not reflect this strategy.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating through numbers from `0` upwards.
- Checking if the current number is present in `a` and if it can be placed in `c` according to the rules.
- Ensuring that the MEX is correctly determined by considering the optimal moves of both players.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the current program does not correctly determine the MEX according to the problem's rules and optimal strategies. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
