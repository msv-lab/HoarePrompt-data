### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the final score of a game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` with the goal of maximizing and minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` that Alice constructs. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

The provided program follows these steps:
1. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
2. It initializes a count list `cntl` to keep track of the frequency of each integer in `a`.
3. It checks if `0` is present in `a`. If not, the MEX is `0`.
4. If `0` is present, it calculates `c` as the minimum of `2` and the count of `0` in `a`.
5. It then iterates through the possible integers from `1` to `n` and decrements `c` whenever it encounters an integer with a count less than `2`.
6. When `c` reaches `0` or the loop ends, it prints the current integer `j` as the MEX.

This logic is correct because:
- If `0` is not in `a`, the MEX is `0` since `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `a`.
- If `0` is in `a`, Alice can ensure that `0` is in `c` by picking it first. The variable `c` is used to track how many more elements Alice can add to `c` without affecting the MEX.
- The loop through integers from `1` to `n` ensures that the smallest integer not present in `a` with a count of less than `2` is found, which is the MEX.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
