### Reasoning:
Let's systematically analyze the problem description, the provided code, the function summaries, and the initial assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation up to 500,000 times.
- The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX (Minimum EXcluded value), and setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX.
- The output should include the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to recursively compute the maximum possible sum for a given subarray `[start_index, end_index]`.
   - It uses memoization with `res_dict` to store previously computed results for subarrays.
   - The computation involves considering different splits of the subarray and the inclusion of individual elements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It recursively constructs the sequence of operations by examining different splits of the subarray.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function modifies the array to form a "staircase" pattern `[0, 1, 2, ..., i]` within a given subarray.
   - It uses a global variable `start_index` which is not defined within the function, leading to a `NameError`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Global Variables**: The code relies on global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without proper initialization or passing them as parameters. This is a significant issue.
- **Undefined `start_index` in `make_stairs`**: The function `make_stairs` uses `start_index` which is not defined within the function, leading to a `NameError`.
- **Inconsistent Output Format**: The code does not output the required format as specified in the problem statement.
- **Recursive Depth**: The recursive approach in `func_1` and `func_2` can lead to excessive recursion depth for larger arrays, which is not handled.
- **Edge Cases**: The code does not explicitly handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, all elements being zero, or arrays with a single element.

#### Function Summary Evaluation:
The function summary for `make_stairs` is accurate in describing its behavior. However, the issues with the global variable and undefined `start_index` remain.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly the reliance on undefined variables and the lack of proper handling of edge cases and output format, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
