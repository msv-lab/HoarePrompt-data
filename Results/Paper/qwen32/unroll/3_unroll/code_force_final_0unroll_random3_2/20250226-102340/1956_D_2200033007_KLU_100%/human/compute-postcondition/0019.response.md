Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, and `is_already_stairs` is `False`. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, no further changes are made to `arr` or `res`. Otherwise, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) are all set to `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, which may modify `res` and other variables in its scope.**
