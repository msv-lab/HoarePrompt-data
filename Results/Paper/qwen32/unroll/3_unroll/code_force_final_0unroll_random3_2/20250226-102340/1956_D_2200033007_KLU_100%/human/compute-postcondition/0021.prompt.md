You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer representing the current index or step in the process of constructing stairs in the array arr, and start_index is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the segment of the array arr that is being processed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: i is a non-negative integer representing the current index or step in the process of constructing stairs in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the segment of the array `arr` that is being processed, and `is_already_stairs` is `True` if all elements in the segment `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` match their respective indices, otherwise `False`.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing
    #State: i is a non-negative integer representing the current index or step in the process of constructing stairs in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the segment of the array `arr` that is being processed, and `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that not all elements in the segment `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` match their respective indices.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 representing the current index or step in the process of constructing stairs in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the segment of the array `arr` that is being processed, and `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that not all elements in the segment `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` match their respective indices.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`. Additionally, elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) are all set to `i`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, and `is_already_stairs` is `False`. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, no further changes are made to `arr` or `res`. Otherwise, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) are all set to `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, which may modify `res` and other variables in its scope.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer representing the current index or step in the process of constructing stairs in the array `arr`. The function either returns nothing or returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
