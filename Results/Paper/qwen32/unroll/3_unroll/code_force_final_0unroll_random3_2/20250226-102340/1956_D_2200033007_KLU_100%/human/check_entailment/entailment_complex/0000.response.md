### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To compute the maximum possible sum of the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `end_index` by considering all possible operations.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - Uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
     - If `start_index == end_index`, it returns the maximum of `1` and `arr[start_index]` since the MEX of a single element is at least `1`.
     - For larger ranges, it considers different subranges and computes the maximum sum by either:
       - Splitting the range at each element and considering the sum of the subranges plus the current element.
       - Including the first or last element of the range and considering the rest.
     - The function returns the maximum sum possible for the given range.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - Computes the maximum value for the range using `func_1`.
     - If the range length is `1`, it checks if the element is already positive. If not, it returns an operation to set it to `1`.
     - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the range length, it means the range can be set to a sequence of increasing integers (0, 1, ..., `length-1`), which maximizes the sum.
     - Otherwise, it tries to find a split point that matches the maximum value and recursively generates operations for the subranges.
     - If no such split point is found, it checks if including the first or last element of the range matches the maximum value and recursively generates operations for the rest of the range.
     - The function returns a list of operations required to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - **Purpose**: To convert a segment of the array into a sequence of increasing integers (0, 1, ..., `i`), which maximizes the sum for that segment.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - Checks if the segment is already in the desired form.
     - If not, it recursively sets the segment to the desired form and appends the corresponding operations to `res`.
     - The function modifies the array `arr` in place and appends tuples to `res` indicating the ranges of the modified segments.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Memoization**: `func_1` uses memoization to ensure that subproblems are solved only once, which optimizes the computation.
- **Recursive Strategy**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` use a recursive strategy to explore all possible ways to maximize the sum and generate the corresponding operations.
- **Base Case**: The base case for `func_1` handles single-element arrays correctly by ensuring the MEX is at least `1`.
- **Correctness of Operations**: `func_2` correctly identifies and generates the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum as computed by `func_1`.
- **Modification of Array**: `make_stairs` correctly modifies the array to achieve the desired sequence and appends the corresponding operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum sum and generates the sequence of operations required to achieve that sum. The functions work together to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
