Reasoning:  
The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and then prints the smaller of the two followed by the larger of the two. This is exactly what the problem statement requires. The execution summary confirms that the function reads the inputs and outputs the minimum and maximum values as intended. The program handles the input and output format as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
