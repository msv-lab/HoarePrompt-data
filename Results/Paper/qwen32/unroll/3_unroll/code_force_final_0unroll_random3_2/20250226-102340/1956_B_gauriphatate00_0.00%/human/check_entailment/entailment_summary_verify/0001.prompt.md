You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a):
    from collections import Counter
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most twice in the list. For each test case, it computes and prints the maximum number of cards that can be matched between you and Nene.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Pairs of Cards:** Since each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck, each player will receive exactly one card of each integer they have in their hand.
2. **Scoring:** You score a point if you place a card on the table and there is already a card with the same integer on the table. Otherwise, you score no points.
3. **Optimal Play:** Nene will play to maximize her score and minimize your score. This means she will try to avoid giving you points whenever possible.

#### Strategy:
- **Pairs in Your Hand:** If you have a pair of cards (two cards with the same integer), you can score a point if Nene places one of the cards first. However, Nene will try to avoid this by playing her pairs first.
- **Max Points:** The maximum number of points you can score is the number of pairs you have, but Nene will counter this by playing her pairs first. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and half the total number of cards you have (since you and Nene each have n cards and each turn results in one card being placed on the table).

#### Implementation:
- **Counter:** We use a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
- **Pairs:** We count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
- **Result:** The result for each test case is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2`.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- **Function `func_1`:** This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting the pairs in your hand and returning the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
- **Function `func_2`:** This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally.
