### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points you can score given that Nene plays optimally. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - You and Nene each have `n` cards.
   - Each card has a number from 1 to `n`, and each number appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - You play `n` turns, and Nene plays `n` turns, alternating turns.
   - On each turn, you choose a card, and if the number on the card is already on the table, you get 1 point.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score if there are multiple optimal moves.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The critical point is that you can only score points if you play a card that has already been placed on the table by Nene.
   - Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to minimize your points. Therefore, she will place cards in such a way that minimizes the number of times you can score.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The best you can do is to try to maximize the number of times you can score by playing pairs of cards that Nene has already placed.
   - The maximum number of points you can score is equal to the number of pairs of cards you have, because Nene will try to prevent you from scoring more than that by playing optimally.

4. **Counting Pairs:**
   - The number of pairs of cards you have is the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - The maximum number of points you can score is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2` because you can only score in `n` turns.

The provided code implements this logic correctly:
- `func_1` calculates the number of pairs in your hand and returns the minimum of this number and `n // 2`.
- `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness:
Given the problem description and the provided code, the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly determines the maximum number of points you can score under the assumption that Nene plays optimally.

**Correctness: True**
