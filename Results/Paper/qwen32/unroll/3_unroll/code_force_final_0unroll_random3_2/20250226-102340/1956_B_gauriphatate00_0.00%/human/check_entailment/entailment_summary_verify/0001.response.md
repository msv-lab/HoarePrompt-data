### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summaries step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Setup:** There are `2n` cards, each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice. Cards are distributed equally between you and Nene, so each gets `n` cards.
2. **Turns:** Players take turns placing cards on the table. If a card with a number already on the table is placed, the player scores a point.
3. **Objective:** Maximize your score while Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
4. **Key Insight:** You can score a point only if you have a pair in your hand and Nene places one of the cards first. However, Nene will play her pairs first to prevent you from scoring. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can score is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2` (since each player has `n` turns).

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(n, a)`:** 
  - Uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each integer in your hand.
  - Counts the number of pairs (`count == 2`).
  - Returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
- **Function `func_2()`:** 
  - Reads input from standard input.
  - Processes each test case by calling `func_1` and stores the result.
  - Prints the results for all test cases.

#### Function Summary Validation:
- The function summary for `func_2` is accurate. It correctly describes the function's behavior of reading test cases, processing them, and printing results.
- The function summary for `func_1` is also accurate. It correctly describes the function's behavior of calculating the maximum number of points based on the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Logic Verification:** The logic in `func_1` is correct. The number of points you can score is indeed the minimum of the number of pairs in your hand and `n // 2`, as Nene will play her pairs first to minimize your score.
- **Implementation Verification:** The implementation in `func_1` correctly counts pairs and computes the result. The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally.

Final: **True**
