In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, the value of `t` determines whether the loop will execute or not.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to ignore the loop variable, so its value does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3**
