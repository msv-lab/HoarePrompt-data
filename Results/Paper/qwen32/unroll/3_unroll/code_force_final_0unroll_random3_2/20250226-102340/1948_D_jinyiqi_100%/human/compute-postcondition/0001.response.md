The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the list `s`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `s` is a list of characters with a length between 1 and 5000, inclusive. The total length of all lists `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The only change is the introduction of the variable `n`, which is the length of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with 1 <= len(s) <= 5000, and `n` is the length of `s`.**
