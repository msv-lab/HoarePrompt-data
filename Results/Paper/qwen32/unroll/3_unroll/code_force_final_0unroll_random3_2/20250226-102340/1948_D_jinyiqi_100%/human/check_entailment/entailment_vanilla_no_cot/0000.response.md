Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Handling of Question Marks**: The program does not replace question marks with any specific character; it only checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k+j` are the same or if one of them is a question mark. This is not enough to guarantee the maximum possible length of a tandem repeat because it does not strategically replace question marks to maximize the tandem repeat length.

2. **Strategy for Maximizing Tandem Repeat**: The program does not have a strategy to maximize the length of the tandem repeat. It simply checks for the longest possible tandem repeat that can be formed with the current characters and question marks, but it does not actively try to create the longest possible tandem repeat by strategically placing letters in place of question marks.

3. **Output for Each Test Case**: The function `func_1` is called but it is not defined properly within the scope of the loop. The function should be defined to handle the logic for each test case, but it is not properly integrated in the loop.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program might not handle edge cases correctly, such as strings with all question marks or strings where the optimal solution requires specific placements of letters.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to implement a strategy to replace question marks in a way that maximizes the length of the tandem repeat. This might involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach to strategically place characters in the string.
