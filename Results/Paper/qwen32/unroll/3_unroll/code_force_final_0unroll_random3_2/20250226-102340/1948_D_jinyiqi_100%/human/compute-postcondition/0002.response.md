To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `j`, `n`, and the range parameters `n // 2`, `0`, and `-1`.

Here's the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the start value of the range (`n // 2`) is greater than the stop value (`0`). The step value is `-1`, meaning `j` will decrement by 1 in each iteration.

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is the length of the list `s`. Given that `1 <= len(s) <= 5000`, `n` is already within a valid range.
2. **`n // 2`**: This is the starting point of the loop. For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than `0`.
3. **`0`**: This is the stop value. The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than `0`.
4. **`-1`**: This is the step value, which means `j` will decrement by 1 in each iteration.

For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than `0`. Since `n` is the length of `s`, and `1 <= len(s) <= 5000`, the smallest possible value for `n` is `1`. Therefore, `n // 2` will be `0` when `n` is `1`, and the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least `2` (so that `n // 2` is at least `1`).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least `2`. The variables `t` and `s` do not affect the execution of this loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with 1 <= len(s) <= 5000, and `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2**
