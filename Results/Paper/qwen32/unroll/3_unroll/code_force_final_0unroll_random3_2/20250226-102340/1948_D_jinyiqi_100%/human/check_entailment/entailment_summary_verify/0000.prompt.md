You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and determines the longest even-length palindromic substring that can be formed by replacing question marks with appropriate characters. If such a substring exists, it prints its length; otherwise, it prints `0`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not replace question marks in a way that maximizes the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. 

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
a?b?a?
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
To maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring, we can replace the question marks in such a way that the string becomes a tandem repeat. For example, replacing the question marks with 'a' results in the string "aaabaa", which contains a tandem repeat "aaabaa" of length 6. However, the program might not necessarily find this optimal solution.

The program only checks for existing characters and question marks without strategically replacing the question marks to maximize the tandem repeat length. Therefore, it may not always provide the correct result as required by the problem statement.

Another example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
??????
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation:**
Replacing all question marks with the same character (e.g., 'a') results in the string "aaaaaa", which is a tandem repeat of length 6. The program should be able to recognize this and output 6, but it may not do so correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to these potential edge cases where it does not maximize the length of the tandem repeat substring by strategically replacing question marks.
