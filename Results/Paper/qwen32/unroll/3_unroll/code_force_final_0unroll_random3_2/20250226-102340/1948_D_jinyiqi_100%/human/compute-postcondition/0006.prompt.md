You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with 1 <= |s| <= 5000. The total length of all strings s over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The function either prints a value of the form `2 * j` and terminates, or it does not print anything if no such sequence is found.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` made up of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The function processes each string `s` and returns a result for each test case. If the string contains question marks, the function replaces them with lowercase Latin letters in such a way that the resulting string is a palindrome. If it is not possible to form a palindrome, the function returns "NO" for that test case. If a palindrome can be formed, it returns "YES" followed by the palindrome string.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
