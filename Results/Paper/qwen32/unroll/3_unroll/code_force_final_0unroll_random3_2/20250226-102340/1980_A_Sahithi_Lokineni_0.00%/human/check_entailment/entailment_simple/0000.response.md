Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there are a few issues with the code that need to be addressed for it to work correctly.

1. The function `default_value` is referenced in the `defaultdict` declaration but is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will cause a `NameError` when the program tries to use it.
2. The logic for calculating the number of additional problems needed is flawed. The current logic adds `m - d[val]` to `ans` for every difficulty level `val` where `d[val] <= m`. This means that if a difficulty level has fewer problems than `m`, it will be counted as needing additional problems, but it will be counted for every round, which is incorrect. Instead, for each difficulty level, the number of additional problems needed is `max(0, m - d[val])`, and this should be summed across all difficulty levels.
3. The function `func_1` is defined but not used, and its return value is not relevant to the problem.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def default_value():
    return 0

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

In this corrected version, the `default_value` function is defined to return 0, which is used by the `defaultdict` to initialize counts for each difficulty level. The loop that calculates `ans` now correctly sums the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level that has fewer than `m` problems.

Given the original program and the comments, it is clear that the program is not correct due to the issues mentioned above.

Correctness: **False**
