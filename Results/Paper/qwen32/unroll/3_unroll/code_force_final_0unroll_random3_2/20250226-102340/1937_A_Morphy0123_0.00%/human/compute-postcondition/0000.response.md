The code snippet provided reads an integer input representing the number of test cases. This input is assigned to the variable `n_cases`. The initial state mentions that there are multiple test cases and each test case contains an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`. However, the provided code only deals with reading the number of test cases.

Output State: **Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `n_cases` (1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4). Each of the following `n_cases` lines contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) which represents the length of the array a.**
