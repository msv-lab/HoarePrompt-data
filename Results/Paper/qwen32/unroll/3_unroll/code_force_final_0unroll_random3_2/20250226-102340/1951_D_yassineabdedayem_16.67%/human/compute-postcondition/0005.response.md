Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to reduce `n` to zero by repeatedly subtracting products of two integers derived from `n` and `k`, while keeping track of the number of such operations. If `n` can be reduced to zero within the constraints, it outputs 'YES' followed by the count of operations and the sequence of integers used. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.**
