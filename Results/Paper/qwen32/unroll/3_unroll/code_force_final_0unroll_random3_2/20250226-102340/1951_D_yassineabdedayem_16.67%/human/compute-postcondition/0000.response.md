Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `k` <= 10^{18}.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the range of 1 to 1000. The other variables `n` and `k` and their conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
