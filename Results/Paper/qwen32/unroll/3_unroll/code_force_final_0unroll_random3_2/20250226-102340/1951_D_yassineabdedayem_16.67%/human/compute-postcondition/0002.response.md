To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables. The loop processes `t` test cases, each with values `n` and `k`. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to reduce `k` to 0 by repeatedly subtracting either `n // k` or `min(n // k, k)` from `k`, while also reducing `n` accordingly. The process continues until either `n` becomes 0, `k` becomes 0, the number of repetitions exceeds 60, or `n` is less than `k`.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the loop's effect:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `rep` is initialized to 0, counting the number of repetitions.
   - `number` is initialized to 0, storing the value to be appended to `tab`.
   - `tab` is an empty list, which will store the sequence of numbers subtracted from `k`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

3. **Inside the Loop**:
   - `Min` and `Max` are calculated as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(n // k, k)`, respectively.
   - If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number = Min` and `k = k - Max`.
   - Otherwise, `number = Max` and `k = k - Min`.
   - `tab` appends the string representation of `number`.
   - `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.
   - `rep` is incremented by 1.

4. **Post-Loop**:
   - If `k == 0`, it prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the contents of `tab`.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the loop's structure and the constraints, the output state will vary based on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case. However, we can describe the general output state after processing all `t` test cases.

After all the test cases are processed, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' results, followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself if the result is 'YES'.

**Output State**: **The output state consists of `t` lines. Each line corresponds to a test case and contains 'YES' or 'NO'. If the result is 'YES', it is followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence of numbers used to reduce `k` to 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` for the next test case is unaffected by the previous test case.**

In simpler terms, the output state will be a series of results indicating whether it was possible to reduce `k` to 0 for each test case, along with the sequence of numbers used if successful.
