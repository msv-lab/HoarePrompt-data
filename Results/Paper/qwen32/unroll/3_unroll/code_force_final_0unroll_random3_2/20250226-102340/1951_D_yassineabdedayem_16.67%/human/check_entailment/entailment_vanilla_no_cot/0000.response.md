Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Logic for determining stall prices**: The program attempts to determine stall prices by calculating `Min` and `Max` values based on the current number of coins `n` and the remaining number of jewels `k`. However, this logic is flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The program does not ensure that the prices are set in a way that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels by the end.

2. **Termination condition**: The loop condition `while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k)` is not sufficient to guarantee that the program will terminate with the correct solution. The loop can exit with `k != 0`, indicating that Alice did not buy the required number of jewels.

3. **Output format**: The program outputs the stall prices in a single line separated by spaces, but the problem description does not specify this format. However, the main issue is the logic, not the format.

A correct approach to solve the problem would be to use a greedy strategy with binary search or a direct construction method to set up the stall prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible solution is to use powers of 2 as stall prices, which can be adjusted to fit the constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > n:
            print('NO')
            continue
        stalls = []
        remaining = k
        power = 0
        while remaining > 0 and len(stalls) < 60:
            price = 2 ** power
            if remaining >= (n // price):
                stalls.append(n // price)
                remaining -= (n // price)
            else:
                stalls.append(remaining)
                remaining = 0
            power += 1
        
        if remaining == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(stalls))
            print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version uses a greedy approach with powers of 2 to determine the stall prices, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
