### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior in the context of the problem description:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function simply returns the minimum of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It is not directly used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is less critical to the overall problem solution. However, it seems to be a utility function that could be useful in some scenarios.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function is responsible for reading two integers `x` and `y` from the input, and calculating the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons.
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This suggests that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (which occupy 4 cells each, totaling 8 cells), and thus `bxsfory` represents the minimum number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
     - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory * 15 - y * 4`), which seems incorrect. It should subtract the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons (`y * 4`), not `bxsfory * 15 - y * 4`. The `15` seems to be an arbitrary number and does not align with the grid size of 5x3.
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15, plus 1. Again, `15` does not align with the grid size and seems incorrect.
     - It prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**:
     - It correctly prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the minimum number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**:
     - It correctly prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is the minimum number of screens required for the 1x1 icons. However, `15` does not align with the grid size of 5x3, and each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons, which is correct.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - It correctly prints `0`, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2()` `t` times.
   - It ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required.

### Issues Identified:
- The calculation of `bxsfory1` in the first case of `func_2()` seems incorrect due to the use of `15`, which does not align with the grid size of 5x3.
- The formula used to adjust `x` after accounting for the 2x2 icons (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`) is incorrect and does not properly account for the space occupied by the 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in `func_2()`, particularly the incorrect use of `15` and the incorrect adjustment of `x`, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of screens required in all cases.

**Correctness: False**
