Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
2. **1x1 Icons**: Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
3. **Screen Capacity**: Each screen can hold a maximum of 15 cells.

### Strategy:
1. **Maximize 2x2 Icon Placement**: Place as many 2x2 icons as possible first since they occupy more space.
2. **Remaining 1x1 Icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, place the remaining 1x1 icons.
3. **Calculate Screens Needed**: Calculate the number of screens needed based on the remaining cells required for 1x1 icons.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided code:

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`
This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. It is not used anywhere in the program, so it seems unnecessary.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of screens needed for a given pair of `x` and `y`.

1. **Case 1: Both `x > 0` and `y > 0`**:
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (taking up 8 cells each), we need `ceil(y / 2)` screens for 2x2 icons.
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. It seems to be trying to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, but the logic is flawed. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line is also incorrect. It should calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but the logic is flawed.
   - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This line prints the total number of screens, but due to the incorrect logic in the previous steps, it will not produce the correct result.

2. **Case 2: `x == 0` and `y > 0`**:
   - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.

3. **Case 3: `x > 0` and `y == 0`**:
   - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `x` 1x1 icons.

4. **Case 4: `x == 0` and `y == 0`**:
   - `print(0)`: This correctly returns 0 screens needed.

#### Function `func_3()`
This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program incorrectly handles the case where both `x > 0` and `y > 0`. The logic for calculating the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons and determining the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is flawed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
