You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Grid Size:** 5x3 (15 cells per screen)
- **Icons:**
  - 1x1 icons (each occupies 1 cell)
  - 2x2 icons (each occupies 4 cells)
- **Objective:** Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. This function is not used anywhere in the provided code.
2. `func_2()`: Handles a single test case by reading input values `x` and `y`, and calculating the minimum number of screens required.
3. `func_3()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_2()` for each test case.

### Key Logic in `func_2()`:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
  - Calculate `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2` (number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons).
  - Adjust `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` (this part seems incorrect as it subtracts more than the actual cells occupied).
  - Calculate `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x / 15` plus 1, and print the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
  - Print the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
  - Print the ceiling of `x / 15`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0:
  - Print 0.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x` Adjustment:**
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It subtracts more cells than necessary and adds an incorrect value.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of `bxsfory1`:**
   - The calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is incorrect. The `+1` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Handling of 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each screen can fit up to 2 2x2 icons, but the calculation `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct in terms of the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
The program does not handle the placement of icons correctly, especially the interaction between 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The logic for adjusting `x` and calculating `bxsfory1` is flawed.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`:
- The program calculates `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2` screens for 2x2 icons.
- It then adjusts `x` incorrectly: `x = 12 - 2 * 15 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2`.
- It calculates `bxsfory1` incorrectly: `bxsfory1 = 0 if -2 <= 0 else math.ceil(-2 / 15) + 1 = 0`.
- Finally, it prints `bxsfory + bxsfory1 = 2 + 0 = 2`.

However, the correct answer should be `2` screens, but the logic for adjusting `x` and calculating `bxsfory1` is flawed and can lead to incorrect results in other cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the placement of icons and the interaction between 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

**Correctness: False**.

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed by adjusting `x` and `bxsfory1` in a flawed manner. This can lead to incorrect results for certain input cases.
