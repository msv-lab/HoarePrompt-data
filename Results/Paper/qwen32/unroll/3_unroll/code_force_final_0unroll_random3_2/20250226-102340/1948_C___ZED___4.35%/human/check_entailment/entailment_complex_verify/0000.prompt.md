You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and there are two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` made up of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines whether there is a valid path based on the arrangement of the characters in the strings and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample where the program fails.

#### Issues in the code:
1. **Handling of the last column**: The code checks if the second last character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is `>`. If not, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because the robot needs to reach the last column (`n`), and the direction of the arrow in the second last column does not directly determine if the robot can reach the last column.
2. **Loop logic for even-indexed columns in the second row**: The code checks if all even-indexed columns in the second row have `>`. If not, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This is also incorrect because the robot can move up and down, and the presence of `<` in even-indexed columns does not necessarily mean the robot cannot reach the target.
3. **Loop logic for odd-indexed columns in the first row**: The code checks if all odd-indexed columns in the first row have `>`. This is incorrect for the same reason as above.

#### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the expected output:**
The robot can follow the path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

**Actual Output of the given program:**
```
NO
```

This is because the program incorrectly checks the direction of the arrows in specific positions and fails to consider the possibility of moving up and down between the rows.

#### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle all cases, it is incorrect. The provided counterexample demonstrates a scenario where the robot can reach the target cell, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO". Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
