### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Fireworks from two installations are launched at intervals `a` and `b` respectively, and each firework remains visible for `m+1` minutes after its launch.

#### Key Points:
1. **Launch Times:**
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...`.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`.

2. **Visibility:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` is visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - If two fireworks are launched `m` minutes apart, they will be visible for one minute together.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the following logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        elif m < a and m > b:
            print(2 + m // b)
        elif m < b and m > a:
            print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

#### Evaluation of the Program:
1. **Condition `m < a and m < b`:**
   - This condition is correct. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, no fireworks from either installation can overlap with another from the same installation within their visibility period. Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 (one from each installation).

2. **Condition `m < a and m > b`:**
   - This condition is incorrect. If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // b + 1` (not `m // b`), plus the one firework from the first installation. So, the correct output should be `1 + (m // b + 1) = m // b + 2`.

3. **Condition `m < b and m > a`:**
   - This condition is also incorrect for the same reason as the previous one. The number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // a + 1`, plus the one firework from the second installation. So, the correct output should be `1 + (m // a + 1) = m // a + 2`.

4. **Else Condition:**
   - This condition is incorrect. If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // a + 1`, and from the second installation is `m // b + 1`. However, the overlap logic is incorrect. The correct approach is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the exact overlap.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that can be visible at the same time.
2. Use the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the exact overlap.

The correct formula is:
- Number of fireworks from the first installation visible at the same time: `m // a + 1`
- Number of fireworks from the second installation visible at the same time: `m // b + 1`
- Overlap (using LCM): `m // lcm(a, b) + 1`

The correct output should be:
\[ \text{max\_fireworks} = (m // a + 1) + (m // b + 1) - (m // \text{lcm}(a, b) + 1) \]

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the overlap logic and has incorrect conditions for `m < a and m > b` and `m < b and m > a`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

### Final: **False**
