Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic needed to solve the problem. The key insight is that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, and an even number of such changes is required to achieve an even difference. Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative because you cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves made.

Let's break down the annotated version of the code to ensure it aligns with this logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `kreker = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - `for i in range(kreker): func_1()`: Iterates over each test case and calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `(n, m) = map(int, input().split())`: Reads two integers `n` and `m` for the current test case.
   - `if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:`: Checks if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative.
     - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the reasoning behind the conditions checked in the `if` statement. The annotations also confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
