### Reasoning:

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move. We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's analyze the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)`:

1. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If `n - m` is even, it means that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes can be achieved by an even number of additions and subtractions. This is because each addition or subtraction changes the count by 1, and an even number of such changes will result in an even difference.
   
2. **Non-negativity Analysis**:
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that we do not need more cubes than the number of moves. If `n - m` is negative, it would imply that we need more cubes than the number of moves, which is impossible since we can only add or remove one cube per move.

Given these two conditions, the logic in the provided program is correct. The program checks if the difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the number of cubes (`m`) is even and non-negative, which correctly determines if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
