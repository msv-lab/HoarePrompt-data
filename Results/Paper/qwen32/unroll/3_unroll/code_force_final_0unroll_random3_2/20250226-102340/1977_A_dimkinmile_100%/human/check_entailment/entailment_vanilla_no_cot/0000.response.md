Let's analyze the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description.

The core logic of the program is as follows:
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`.
- If the condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

To determine if this logic is correct, let's consider the problem requirements:
- We need to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add or remove a single cube.
- Therefore, the difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) results in no net change or a net change of Â±2 cubes.
- Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative because the number of moves `n` must be at least as many as the difference `m` (since we can't remove more cubes than we've added).

The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` correctly captures these requirements:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference is even.
- `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach the desired number of cubes.

The program is structured correctly with a loop to handle multiple test cases and a function `func_1` to process each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
