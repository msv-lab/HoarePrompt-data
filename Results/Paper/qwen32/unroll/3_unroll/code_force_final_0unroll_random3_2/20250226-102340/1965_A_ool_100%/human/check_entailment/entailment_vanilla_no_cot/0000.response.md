Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The program incorrectly uses a set to determine the winner, which does not account for the optimal strategy in this game, which is related to the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes.

In this game, the key to determining the winner is to calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins because Alice cannot make a move that will leave a non-zero Nim-sum for Bob. Otherwise, Alice wins because she can always make a move that leaves a Nim-sum of zero for Bob.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    nim_sum = 0
    for a in arr:
        nim_sum ^= a
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This corrected program calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
