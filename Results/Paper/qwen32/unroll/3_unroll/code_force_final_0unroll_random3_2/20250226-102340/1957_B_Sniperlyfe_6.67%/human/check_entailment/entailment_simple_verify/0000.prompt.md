You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 (reduced by the sum of the largest numbers representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits for each iteration), and `nums` is a list of `n` elements, each being the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits at the time of its assignment.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements, where each element except the last one is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, and the last element is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits plus `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The current implementation of `func_1` creates a sequence where each element is set to the maximum possible value with the same number of bits as `k` (i.e., `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`), and then adjusts the last element to make the sum equal to `k`. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`.

- The program will first set both elements to `1 << 3.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is `1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = 1 << 1 - 1 = 1 << 0 - 1 = 0`. This is incorrect because `3.bit_length()` is 2, so it should be `1 << 1 - 1 = 1 << 0 = 1`. However, even if we correct this, the approach is flawed.
- The correct approach should distribute the bits in such a way that the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s. For `k = 3`, the optimal sequence is `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]` because `1 | 2 = 3` which is `11` in binary, having two 1s.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, we should distribute the bits of `k` across the sequence in such a way that the resulting OR has as many 1s as possible. One way to achieve this is to use the binary representation of `k` and distribute the bits to different elements of the sequence.

### Improved Implementation:
Here is an improved version of the function that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        # Set the i-th bit if possible
        if k & (1 << i):
            nums[i] += (1 << i)
            k -= (1 << i)
        else:
            # If the i-th bit is not set in k, we can still use the remaining value of k
            if k > 0:
                nums[i] += 1
                k -= 1
    return nums
```

This implementation ensures that the sequence is constructed in such a way that the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

Since the original program does not handle the distribution of bits correctly, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
