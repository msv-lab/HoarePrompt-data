Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the implementation of `func_1`:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Binary Representation**: The program attempts to set each number to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is not necessarily the optimal choice to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Handling Remaining Sum**: After the loop, the program adds the remaining sum `k` to the last element of the sequence. However, this does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

3. **Strategy to Maximize 1s**: To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, you should aim to use numbers that have as many 1s as possible in their binary representation. One effective strategy is to use powers of 2 and distribute the sum `k` accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = []
    while k > 0:
        if n == 1:
            nums.append(k)
            break
        # Use the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k
        power = 1
        while power * 2 <= k:
            power *= 2
        nums.append(power)
        k -= power
        n -= 1
    # Fill the rest with zeros if necessary
    nums.extend([0] * (n - len(nums)))
    return nums
```

This corrected function ensures that we use the largest possible powers of 2 to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
