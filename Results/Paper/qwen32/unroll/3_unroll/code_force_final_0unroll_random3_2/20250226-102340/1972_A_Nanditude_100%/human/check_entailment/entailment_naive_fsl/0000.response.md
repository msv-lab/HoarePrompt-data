Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The program does not handle the case where the difficulty of the new problem (w) needs to be inserted into the list `a` and then the list `a` needs to be sorted and the largest element removed. Instead, the program simply counts how many times an element in `a` is greater than the corresponding element in `b` and increments `cnt` accordingly. This does not simulate the process of inserting new problems and removing the most difficult one.

Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
5 6 7
4 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- Insert a problem with difficulty `4`, `a` becomes `[4, 5, 6]`, remove `7` -> `a = [4, 5, 6]`.
- Insert a problem with difficulty `5`, `a` becomes `[4, 5, 5, 6]`, remove `6` -> `a = [4, 5, 5]`.
- Now `a = [4, 5, 5]` and `b = [4, 5, 6]`, so no more problems need to be added.

However, the program will output `2` because `a[0] > b[0]` is false, `a[1] > b[1]` is false, and `a[2] > b[2]` is true, so `cnt` will be `1`. This is incorrect because it does not simulate the process described in the problem statement.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
