To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and its impact on the variables provided.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the following operations are performed:
1. Read `n`, the number of elements in the lists `a` and `b`.
2. Read the lists `a` and `b`, both of which are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. Initialize a counter `cnt` to 0 and an index `i` to 0.
4. Iterate over each element in list `b` using index `j`:
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, increment `cnt`.
   - Otherwise, increment `i` (to move to the next element in `a`).
5. Print the value of `cnt` after the inner loop completes.

The counter `cnt` keeps track of how many elements in `b` are less than the current element in `a` pointed to by `i`. The index `i` is incremented when an element in `b` is not less than the current element in `a`, ensuring that we are always comparing the smallest unused element in `a` with elements in `b`.

After all iterations of the outer loop (i.e., after processing all `t` test cases), the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will be in their final states as they were last read for the last test case. The variables `cnt` and `i` will be in their final states as they were at the end of the last inner loop iteration of the last test case.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i; `b` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for each i; `cnt` is the number of elements in the last `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` as per the described logic; `i` is the index in `a` after the last comparison in the last test case.**
