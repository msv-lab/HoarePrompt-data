The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases to be processed. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which aligns with the input being read into `test_cases`.

The other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) are mentioned as part of the test case descriptions but are not affected by the code snippet provided. They will be read in subsequent code that is not shown here.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input representing the number of test cases, and the initial state conditions for `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain unchanged except that `t` is now referred to as `test_cases`.**
