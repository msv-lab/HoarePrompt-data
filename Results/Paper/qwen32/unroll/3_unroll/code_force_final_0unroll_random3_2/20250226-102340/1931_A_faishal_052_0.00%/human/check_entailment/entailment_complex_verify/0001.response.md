### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
Given an encoded integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), we need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to this integer. The encoding process sums the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

#### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. Reads the encoded value `lex`.
2. Initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
3. Iterates twice:
   - If `lex` is ≤ 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is > 26 but < 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is ≥ 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
4. Appends the remaining `lex` value to `arr`.
5. Sorts `arr` and prints the corresponding characters by converting each number to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling of Remaining Value:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the remaining value of `lex` after the loop. For example, if `lex` is 78, after the loop `arr` will be `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be 26. The program then appends 26 to `arr`, resulting in `[26, 26, 26]`. However, the correct result for 78 should be `[1, 26, 51]` which corresponds to the word "rzz".

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - Sorting the list `arr` after appending the remaining value of `lex` does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `lex` = 24, the program will append `[1, 1, 22]` and then sort it, resulting in `[1, 1, 22]` which corresponds to "aav". This is correct, but the approach is not robust for all cases.

#### Correct Approach:
To ensure the lexicographically smallest word, the program should:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters.
- Calculate the remaining value for the third letter.
- Ensure that the third letter is the largest possible value that does not exceed the remaining value.

#### Example Walkthrough:
For `lex = 78`:
- First two letters should be the smallest possible, i.e., `[1, 26]` (corresponding to "a", "z").
- Remaining value for the third letter is `78 - 1 - 26 = 51` (corresponding to "z").
- The correct word is "azv" (or "aavz" if not sorted, but the smallest valid word is "azv").

#### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the provided program is not correct for all test cases. It does not handle the remaining value of `lex` correctly and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
