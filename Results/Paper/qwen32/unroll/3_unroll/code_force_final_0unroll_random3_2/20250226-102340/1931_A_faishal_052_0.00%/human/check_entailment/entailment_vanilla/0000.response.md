Let's carefully examine the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case.

2. **Encoding Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
   - It then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose character positions sum to `lex`.

3. **Character Assignment:**
   - The program initializes an array `arr` to store the positions of the three letters.
   - It iterates twice, assigning the highest possible value (26) to the first two positions of the array if `lex` is greater than 26.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it assigns 1 to the first position and reduces `lex` by 1.
   - The remaining value of `lex` is assigned to the third position of the array.

4. **Sorting and Output:**
   - The array `arr` is then sorted in ascending order.
   - The program converts the sorted positions to their corresponding letters by adding 96 (the ASCII value of 'a' - 1) and prints them.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Assignment Logic:**
  - The logic for assigning values to the array `arr` is flawed. The program should aim to minimize the first letter as much as possible, and then the second, and so on, rather than just assigning the maximum possible value (26) to the first two positions.

- **Lexicographical Order:**
  - The program does not ensure that the word is lexicographically smallest. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might assign `[1, 26, 26]` and sort it to `[1, 26, 26]`, which corresponds to "a zz", but the correct output should be "aav".

### Correct Approach:

1. **Initialize the Array:**
   - Start with the smallest possible values for the three letters, i.e., `[1, 1, 1]`.

2. **Distribute the Remaining Sum:**
   - Subtract 3 from `lex` (since the initial sum of `[1, 1, 1]` is 3).
   - Distribute the remaining sum among the three positions in a way that keeps the first letter as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

3. **Ensure Lexicographical Order:**
   - Always try to increase the smallest letter first.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer.

**Correctness: False**
