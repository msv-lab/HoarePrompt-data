The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `t` is not related to the loop execution and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and `cases` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is not initialized before the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` must be greater than 0**
