To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided loop and how it modifies the variables and outputs based on the initial conditions and inputs.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(cases):`)**:
   - This loop runs `cases` number of times.
   - For each iteration, it initializes an empty list `arr` and reads an integer `lex` from the input.

2. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(2):`)**:
   - This loop runs twice.
   - Depending on the value of `lex`, it appends either 1, 26, or 26 to `arr` and then decrements `lex` by the corresponding amount.
     - If `lex <= 26`, it appends 1 and decrements `lex` by 1.
     - If `26 < lex < 52`, it appends 26 and decrements `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex >= 52`, it appends 26 and decrements `lex` by 26.

3. **Appending Remaining `lex`**:
   - After the inner loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Printing**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - The first three elements of `arr` are converted to characters (by adding 96 to each element) and printed in sequence without spaces.

### Understanding the Output:
- The loop processes each input `lex` independently.
- For each `lex`, it determines the characters that correspond to the values in `arr` after sorting.
- The characters are derived by mapping the values in `arr` to the alphabet (1 -> 'a', 2 -> 'b', ..., 26 -> 'z').

### Example:
Let's consider an example with `cases = 2` and inputs `lex = 27` and `lex = 53`:

1. **First Iteration (`lex = 27`)**:
   - Inner loop:
     - `lex = 27 > 26`, so append 26, `lex = 1`.
     - `lex = 1 <= 26`, so append 1, `lex = 0`.
   - After inner loop: `arr = [26, 1]`
   - Append remaining `lex`: `arr = [26, 1, 0]`
   - Sort `arr`: `arr = [0, 1, 26]`
   - Convert to characters: `chr(0 + 96) = '` (not a valid character, but for understanding), `chr(1 + 96) = 'a'`, `chr(26 + 96) = 'z'`
   - Output: `az`

2. **Second Iteration (`lex = 53`)**:
   - Inner loop:
     - `lex = 53 >= 52`, so append 26, `lex = 27`.
     - `lex = 27 > 26`, so append 26, `lex = 1`.
   - After inner loop: `arr = [26, 26]`
   - Append remaining `lex`: `arr = [26, 26, 1]`
   - Sort `arr`: `arr = [1, 26, 26]`
   - Convert to characters: `chr(1 + 96) = 'a'`, `chr(26 + 96) = 'z'`, `chr(26 + 96) = 'z'`
   - Output: `azz`

### General Output State:
After all iterations, the output consists of the concatenated results of each iteration, where each iteration produces three characters based on the input `lex`.

### Output State:
Since the output is dependent on the specific inputs for each `lex`, and without specific input values, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **The output state is a sequence of characters derived from the values in `arr` after sorting and converting to letters for each iteration of the loop.**
