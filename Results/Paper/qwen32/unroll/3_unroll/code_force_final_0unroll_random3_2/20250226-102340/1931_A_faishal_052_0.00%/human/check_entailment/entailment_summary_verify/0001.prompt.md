You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and performs calculations to derive three characters. These characters are then printed in sorted order. The characters are determined based on the value of `lex`, with values up to 26 corresponding to letters 'a' to 'z', and values above 26 being adjusted accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Logic to Find the Lexicographically Smallest Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters of the word):
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex` is 52 or greater, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It then sorts the list `arr` and prints the corresponding characters by converting each number to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling of Remaining Value:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the remaining value of `lex` after the loop. For example, if `lex` is 78, after the loop `arr` will be `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be 26. The program then appends 26 to `arr`, resulting in `[26, 26, 26]`. However, the correct result for 78 should be `[1, 26, 51]` which corresponds to the word "rzz".

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - Sorting the list `arr` after appending the remaining value of `lex` does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `lex` = 24, the program will append `[1, 1, 22]` and then sort it, resulting in `[1, 1, 22]` which corresponds to "aav". This is correct, but the approach is not robust for all cases.

### Correct Approach

To ensure the lexicographically smallest word, the program should:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters.
- Calculate the remaining value for the third letter.
- Ensure that the third letter is the largest possible value that does not exceed the remaining value.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program is not correct for all test cases.
