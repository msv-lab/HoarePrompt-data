Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are positive integers representing the number of prepared problems, the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively. It also accepts three lists: `A`, a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `D`, a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models; and `F`, a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions. The function returns a value based on the relationship between these complexities, but the specific return value is not described in the given constraints and relationships.**
