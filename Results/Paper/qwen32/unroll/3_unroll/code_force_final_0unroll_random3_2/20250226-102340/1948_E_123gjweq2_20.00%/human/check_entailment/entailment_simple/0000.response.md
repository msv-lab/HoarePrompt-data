### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.
   - It then calls `make_array` for each segment of size `k` (or smaller for the last segment), filling the segment with a unique clique number.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - It fills the segment from `left` to `right` in `arr` with values from `small_element` to `big_element` in a specific order.
   - It assigns the same `clique` number to all elements in the segment in `cliquess`.

### Analysis:
- **Assigning integers to vertices (`arr`)**:
  - The program assigns integers to vertices in a specific pattern within each segment of size `k`. However, the problem statement requires all `a_i` to be distinct integers from 1 to n. The current implementation does not ensure this.
  - For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the program might assign `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]` to `arr`, which violates the requirement that all `a_i` should be distinct.

- **Creating edges**:
  - The program does not explicitly create edges based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. It only assigns clique numbers but does not verify that the edges are correctly formed based on the given condition.

- **Partitioning into cliques (`cliquess`)**:
  - The program assigns clique numbers to segments of size `k` but does not ensure that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The condition for forming edges is not considered during the partitioning process.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to ensure that all `a_i` are distinct and does not verify the edge formation condition.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
