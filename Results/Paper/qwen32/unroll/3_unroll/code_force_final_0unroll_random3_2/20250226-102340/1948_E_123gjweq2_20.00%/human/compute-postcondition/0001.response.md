Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `big_element` has been updated to be `right + 1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, and `small_element`) retain their initial values and conditions.
