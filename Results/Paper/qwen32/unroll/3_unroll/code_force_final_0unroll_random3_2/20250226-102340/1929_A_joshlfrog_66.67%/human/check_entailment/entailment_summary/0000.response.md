Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The beauty is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order, because this maximizes the positive differences and minimizes the negative or zero differences.

However, the given program does not sort the array or compute the sum of differences as described. Instead, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array for each test case, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty as defined by the problem statement.

For example, consider the first test case in the problem statement:
Input: 
```
3
2 1 3
```
The program calculates the difference between the maximum (3) and minimum (1) values, which is 2. While this is the correct output for this specific test case, it is not a general solution for all cases. For instance, the third test case:
Input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program calculates the difference between the maximum (100) and minimum (43) values, which is 57. This is the correct output for this test case as well, but it is still not a general solution based on the problem's definition of beauty.

The correct approach would be to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
