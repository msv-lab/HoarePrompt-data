You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list `a`. If no such sequence is found, it prints `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array such that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements using the specified operation (replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a variable `same` to count consecutive identical elements, `num` to store the current number being counted, and `minn` to store the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found so far.
2. **Iteration**: It iterates through the array, updating `same` when consecutive elements are identical and resetting `same` and updating `minn` when a different element is encountered.
3. **Final Check**: After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the last counted sequence of identical elements.
4. **Output**: If `minn` is still `inf` (which would mean no sequence of identical elements was found, which is not possible given the problem constraints), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Logic Error**: The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. The problem requires finding the smallest group of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to disrupt the ability to make the entire array identical using the specified operation. The current logic simply finds the smallest group of consecutive identical elements, which does not necessarily solve the problem.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles arrays with all identical elements correctly (outputs `-1`), but it does not handle cases where the array can be split into multiple groups of identical elements correctly. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program would output `3`, but the correct answer is `3` (removing the `5` and two `3`s around it to make the array not beautiful).

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
