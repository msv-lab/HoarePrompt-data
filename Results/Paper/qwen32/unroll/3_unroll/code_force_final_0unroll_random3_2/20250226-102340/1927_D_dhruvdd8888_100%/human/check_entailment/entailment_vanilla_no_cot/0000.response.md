Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for finding two different elements within the specified range for each query. Here are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Initialization and Appending a Dummy Value**: The program appends `-1` to the `nums` list to handle the end of the sequence. However, this can lead to incorrect results if the array already contains `-1` or if the logic for handling ranges is incorrect.

2. **Segmentation of Array**: The program segments the array into contiguous segments of the same elements and stores these segments in `arr`. However, the logic for handling queries does not correctly identify whether there are two different elements within the specified range.

3. **Query Handling**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the query's left boundary. However, it does not properly check if there are two different elements within the range `[l, r]`. Specifically:
   - It does not correctly handle the case where the segment found by `bisect_left` does not cover the entire range `[l, r]`.
   - It does not correctly check the next segment to see if it contains a different element.
   - The conditions for printing `-1 -1` are not correctly defined.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases, such as when the range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element.

To fix the program, a more straightforward approach would be to directly check each query's range for two different elements. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def main():
    input = stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    tc = int(input[ptr])
    ptr += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(input[ptr])
        ptr += 1
        nums = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+N]))
        ptr += N
        q = int(input[ptr])
        ptr += 1
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input[ptr:ptr+2])
            ptr += 2
            found = False
            for i in range(l-1, r):
                for j in range(i+1, r):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        results.append(f"{i+1} {j+1}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version directly checks each query's range for two different elements, which is more straightforward and avoids the complications of segmenting the array.
