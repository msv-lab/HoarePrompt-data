Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The main issue is that the program only considers the elements from the median index to the end of the array for increasing the median, which is not sufficient. To ensure the median increases, the program should consider the middle elements of the array and make sure the median element (or elements, in case of even-sized arrays) is increased.

Here's a corrected approach:

1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median element(s).
3. Use a min-heap to track the smallest elements that need to be increased.
4. Increase the smallest elements until the median is strictly greater than the original median.

Let's correct the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        (n, arr) = test_cases[i]
        arr.sort()
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        if n % 2 == 1:
            # Odd number of elements
            current_median = arr[median_index]
            heap = arr[:median_index + 1]
        else:
            # Even number of elements
            current_median = arr[median_index]
            heap = arr[:median_index + 1]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        operations = 0
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        results.append(operations)
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        test_cases.append((n, arr))
        index += 1 + n
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

However, the above code still needs a bit more refinement. Specifically, for even-sized arrays, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but we should only consider the lower middle element for increasing the median. Here is the final corrected version:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        (n, arr) = test_cases[i]
        arr.sort()
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        heap = arr[:median_index + 1]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        operations = 0
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        results.append(operations)
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        test_cases.append((n, arr))
        index += 1 + n
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This version should correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for both odd and even-sized arrays.
