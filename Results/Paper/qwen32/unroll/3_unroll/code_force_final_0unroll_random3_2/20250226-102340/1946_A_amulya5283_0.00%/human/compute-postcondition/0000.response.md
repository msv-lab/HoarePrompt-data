The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within a certain range, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples with specific constraints. Since the code only initializes `results`, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and `results` is an empty list.**
