You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a set of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to ensure that the smallest element in a heap (constructed from the second half of the sorted list) is greater than the median of the original list. The function returns a list of these operation counts corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Problem Understanding
The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. An operation consists of increasing any element of the array by 1.

### Median Definition
- For an array of odd length, the median is the middle element after sorting.
- For an array of even length, the median is the smallest of the two middle elements after sorting.

### Program Analysis
The provided program aims to find the minimum number of operations to increase the median of each test case array. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It stores these in the `test_cases` list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the array is sorted.
   - The median index is determined as `n // 2`.
   - The current median is the element at the median index in the sorted array.
   - A heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array. This heap is used to efficiently find and modify the smallest element in this part of the array.
   - The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly increases the smallest element in the heap (which is part of the array starting from the median index) until it becomes greater than the current median. Each increase counts as an operation.
   - The number of operations required to do this is stored in the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of operations required for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Sorting and Median Calculation:**
  - The program correctly sorts the array and identifies the median index.
  - The median is correctly identified as the element at the median index in the sorted array.
  
- **Heap Usage:**
  - The heap is used to efficiently find and modify the smallest element in the part of the array starting from the median index.
  - The program correctly increases the smallest element in the heap until it becomes greater than the current median.
  
- **Operation Counting:**
  - The number of operations is correctly counted as the number of times the smallest element in the heap is increased.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles arrays of both odd and even lengths.
  - The program handles arrays with duplicate elements.
  - The program handles arrays with very large values.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It efficiently uses sorting and a heap to achieve this.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
