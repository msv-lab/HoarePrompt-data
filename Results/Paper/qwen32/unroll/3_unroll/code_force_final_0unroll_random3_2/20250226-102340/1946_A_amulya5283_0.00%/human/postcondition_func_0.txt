The function `func_1` processes a set of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to ensure that the smallest element in a heap (constructed from the second half of the sorted list) is greater than the median of the original list. The function returns a list of these operation counts corresponding to each test case.
