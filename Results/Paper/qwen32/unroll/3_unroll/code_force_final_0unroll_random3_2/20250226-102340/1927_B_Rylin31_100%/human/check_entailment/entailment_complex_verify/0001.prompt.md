You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that corresponds to the given trace a.

    #State: A sequence of strings, each corresponding to the output of each test case, constructed by mapping each value in `array` to a character based on the current value in `s` and then incrementing that value in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it constructs and outputs a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters, where each character in `s` is determined by the values in `a` and the current state of a frequency counter `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given a "trace" array `a` of length `n`, where `a[i]` represents the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the original string `s`.
- The task is to reconstruct any valid string `s` that could have produced this trace.
- The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters (a-z).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the trace array and the trace array itself.

2. **Reconstruction Logic**:
   - It initializes an array `s` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This array will be used to keep track of how many times each character has been used so far.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` which will store the final reconstructed string.
   - For each value `j` in the trace array:
     - It appends the character corresponding to `s[j]` to the result string `ans`. The character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`, which maps 0 to 'a', 1 to 'b', and so on.
     - It increments `s[j]` by 1 to indicate that the character has been used once more.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` based on the given trace array.
- The logic of using `s[j]` to determine the character to append ensures that the number of previous occurrences of a character in the reconstructed string matches the trace array.
- The program guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the constraints on the trace array ensure that a valid string always exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` that could have produced the given trace array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
