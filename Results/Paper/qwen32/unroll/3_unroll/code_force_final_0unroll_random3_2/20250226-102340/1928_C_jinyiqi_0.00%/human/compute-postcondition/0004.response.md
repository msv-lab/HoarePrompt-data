To determine the output state after the loop has executed, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive). For each `i`, if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), both `i` and `x / i` are added to `output1` and `output2` respectively.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of what happens:

1. The loop starts with `i = 1` and checks if `1` is a divisor of `x`. Since `1` is a divisor of any integer, `1` is added to `output1` and `x / 1` (which is `x`) is added to `output2`.
2. The loop continues with `i = 2`, `i = 3`, and so on, up to `i = int(x ** 0.5)`.
3. For each `i`, if `x % i == 0`, `i` and `x / i` are added to `output1` and `output2` respectively.
4. The loop stops once `i` exceeds the square root of `x`.

After the loop, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list of divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
