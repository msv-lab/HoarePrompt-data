Output State: **The program returns a list of divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, followed by a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.**

This means that the returned list first contains all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, and then it continues with the divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, listed in reverse order.
