Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is called within the main loop, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incomplete Output Handling:** The program calculates potential values for `k` and stores them in the `output` list. However, it does not print the length of the `output` list, which is required by the problem statement.

3. **Logic Errors in Calculating `k`:** The logic for calculating `k` seems to be incorrect. The program attempts to use divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` to determine possible values of `k`, but it does not correctly account for the repeating pattern described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the condition that `k` must be greater than 1 and that the pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

4. **Integer Division:** The program uses `/` for division, which results in a float. Since `k` must be an integer, the program should use `//` for integer division.

To illustrate the issues, let's consider a simple test case:

**Input:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will raise a `NameError` due to the undefined `func_1` function.

Even if the `func_1` function were defined correctly, the logic for calculating `k` and handling the output would need to be corrected to match the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
