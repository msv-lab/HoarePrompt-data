Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The program seems to be counting combinations of sticks with the same length, but it does not check the triangle inequality condition, which is necessary for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

For three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the following inequality must hold: \(a + b > c\).

The program provided does not include this check. Here is a corrected approach:

1. Sort the lengths of the sticks.
2. Iterate through all possible combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lengths = [2 ** x for x in a]
        lengths.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
                for k in range(j + 1, n):
                    if lengths[i] + lengths[j] > lengths[k]:
                        count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

However, this brute-force approach is not efficient enough for the given constraints. A more efficient approach would involve sorting and using a two-pointer technique to avoid the triple nested loop. Here is an optimized version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            j = 0
            k = i - 1
            while j < k:
                if (1 << a[j]) + (1 << a[k]) > (1 << a[i]):
                    count += k - j
                    k -= 1
                else:
                    j += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This optimized version sorts the array of exponents and uses a two-pointer technique to count the number of valid triplets that satisfy the triangle inequality.
