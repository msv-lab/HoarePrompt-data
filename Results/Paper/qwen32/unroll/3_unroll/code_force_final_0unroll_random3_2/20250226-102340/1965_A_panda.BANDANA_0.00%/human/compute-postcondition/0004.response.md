Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then determines whether the integer `1` is present in the list. If `1` is present, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
