### Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a different integer `n`. For each `n`, it should determine whether it is possible to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, and if so, print such a string.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
2. **Special Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters.
3. **Constructing the String**:
   - **Even `n`**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of different letters. For example, for `n = 6`, it might produce "AABBCC", which indeed has 6 special characters.
   - **Odd `n`**: If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then continues with pairs of different letters. For example, for `n = 3`, it outputs "AAA", which has 3 special characters.

The program ensures that the string length does not exceed 200 characters, as required by the problem statement. The logic used for constructing the string guarantees that exactly `n` special characters are present.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all specified cases based on the provided logic and examples. It correctly outputs "NO" when `n` is 1 and constructs valid strings with exactly `n` special characters for other values of `n`.

**Correctness: True**
