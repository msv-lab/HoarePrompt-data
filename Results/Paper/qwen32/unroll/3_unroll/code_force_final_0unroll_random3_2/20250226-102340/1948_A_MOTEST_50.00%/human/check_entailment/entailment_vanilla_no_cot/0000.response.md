Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem. Specifically:

1. For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character with a single character string.
2. For even `n`, the program constructs a string with `n` special characters by repeating pairs of different letters. This works correctly.
3. For odd `n`, the program incorrectly starts with "AAA" and then adds pairs of different letters, which does not guarantee that there will be exactly `n` special characters. For example, if `n = 3`, the program will output "AAA", which has only 2 special characters.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the string has exactly `n` special characters for any `n`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Start with "AA" to ensure at least one special character
            ans = "AA"
            # We need n-1 more special characters
            # Each pair of different letters adds exactly one special character
            for i in range(1, (n-1)//2 + 1):
                ans += chr(65 + i) * 2
            # If n is odd, we need one more special character
            if n % 2 == 1:
                ans += chr(65 + (n-1)//2 + 1)
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

This version ensures that for any `n`, the string has exactly `n` special characters.
