Let's examine the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string.
- A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Logic for Constructing the String:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of consecutive letters from the alphabet. For example, for `n=6`, it constructs "AABBCC".
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then repeats pairs of consecutive letters from the alphabet. For example, for `n=3`, it constructs "AAABB".

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs "YES" followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be formed.
   - It outputs "NO" if `n` is 1.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case 1: `n=1`**
  - The program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
- **Case 2: `n` is even**
  - The program constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating pairs of letters. For example, for `n=6`, the string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters.
- **Case 3: `n` is odd**
  - The program constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by starting with "AAA" and then repeating pairs of letters. For example, for `n=3`, the string "AAABB" has 3 special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all described cases and constructs valid strings for the given problem constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
