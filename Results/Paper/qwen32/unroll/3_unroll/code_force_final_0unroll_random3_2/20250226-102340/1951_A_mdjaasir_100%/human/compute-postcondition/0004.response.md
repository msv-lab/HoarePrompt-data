Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `a`. It then counts the number of '1's in the string `a` and prints 'YES' if the count is 0, if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is exactly 2 and the two '1's are not adjacent. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints output.**
