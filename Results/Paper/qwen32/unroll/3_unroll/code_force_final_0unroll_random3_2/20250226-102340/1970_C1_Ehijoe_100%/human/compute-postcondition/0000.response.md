The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and `t` is an integer equal to 1. The value of `t` is overwritten by the input value, but since the problem states that `t` is always 1, we can assume the input value for `t` will also be 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the single round of the game.**
