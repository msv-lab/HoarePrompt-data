The code snippet only sets the variable `empty` to `True`. None of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `u_1`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the addition of the `empty` variable set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the single round of the game. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True.**
