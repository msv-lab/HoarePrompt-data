To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Setup**: 
   - We have a tree with `n` nodes.
   - There is a stone on one node at the start of each round.
   - Players Ron and Hermione take turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the winner of the game if both players play optimally.
   - The game is played once (`t=1`), and the starting node is given.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The key observation is that the player who starts on a node with an odd number of moves (considering the longest path to a leaf) will win because they can force the opponent into a position where they have no moves left.
   - If all possible moves are even, Hermione wins because Ron can always mirror Hermione's moves.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to represent the tree as an adjacency list.
   - It reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It reads the edges and constructs the tree.

2. **Leaf Nodes Identification**:
   - The program identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection) and stores them in a deque `leaves`.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - It traverses the tree and collects distances to all leaf nodes.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if any of the distances to the leaf nodes are odd.
   - If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins (`print('Ron')`).
   - Otherwise, Hermione wins (`print('Hermione')`).

### Verification:
- The program correctly identifies the longest path to a leaf node from the starting node.
- It correctly determines the parity of the distances and decides the winner based on that.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for the game described.

**Correctness: True**
