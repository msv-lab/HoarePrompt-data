You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer at index `i` is the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each integer at index `i` was the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the original list `a` minus 1; `cur` is the sum of the remaining counts in `counter` after decrementing each by 1; `cnt` is `n - len(a)` reduced by the number of elements inserted into `ans` between the elements of `a`; `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in their original order, plus any additional elements inserted between them.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each integer at index `i` was the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the original list `a` minus 1; `cur` is the sum of the remaining counts in `counter` after decrementing each by 1; `cnt` is `n - len(a)` reduced by the number of elements inserted into `ans` between the elements of `a`; `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in their original order, plus `cnt` additional elements inserted between them, each being one less than the previous element.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: elements of `ans` (where `ans` is constructed by starting with the elements of `a` in their original order and inserting `cnt` additional elements between each pair, each inserted element being one less than the previous element in `ans`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of an array `a`. It also takes `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array `a`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
