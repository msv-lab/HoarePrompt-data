You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an array of integers by first incrementing each element by its 1-based index, then constructs a new list by inserting additional elements between the sorted unique values of the modified array. The inserted elements are one less than the previous element in the new list, and the total number of inserted elements ensures the final list's length equals the original array's length. The function prints the resulting list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input and Output:**
   - Input: Multiple test cases. Each test case has an array `a` of length `n`.
   - Output: For each test case, output the lexicographically largest array `b` formed by the described operations.

2. **Operations:**
   - Perform `n` operations where in each operation, select an index `i`, insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S` (a set does not allow duplicates), and remove `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After all operations, `b` is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.

3. **Objective:**
   - To maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - For each element in `a`, it adds the index (1-based) to the element. This is done by `a[i] += i + 1`.

3. **Using Set and Counter:**
   - The program converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates.
   - It then sorts the unique elements in decreasing order.
   - A `Counter` is used to keep track of the occurrences of each element before removing duplicates.

4. **Constructing `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique elements.
   - For each element, it adds the element to `ans` and decreases its count in the `Counter`.
   - It also calculates how many elements can be inserted between the current and previous element to maximize the lexicographical order.
   - If there are remaining elements to be added (due to duplicates), it adds the smallest possible values to `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where all elements are the same.
   - It ensures that the final array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.

### Correctness:
The solution correctly implements the described operations and ensures that the final array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible. It uses a set to handle duplicates and a counter to keep track of occurrences, ensuring that the final array is constructed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and handles the given constraints effectively.

Correctness: **True**
