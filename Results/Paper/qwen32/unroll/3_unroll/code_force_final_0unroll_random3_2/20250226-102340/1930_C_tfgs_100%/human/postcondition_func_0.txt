The function processes an array of integers by first incrementing each element by its 1-based index, then constructs a new list by inserting additional elements between the sorted unique values of the modified array. The inserted elements are one less than the previous element in the new list, and the total number of inserted elements ensures the final list's length equals the original array's length. The function prints the resulting list for each test case.
