### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Incrementing Elements**: The program first increments each element of the array `a` by its 1-based index. This is done in the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       a[i] += i + 1
   ```
   This step ensures that each element `a_i` is transformed into `a_i + i + 1`, as required by the problem statement.

2. **Creating a Set of Unique Values**: After modifying the array, the program creates a set of unique values from the modified array `a`:
   ```python
   a = list(set(a))
   ```
   This is done to ensure that only unique elements are considered, as inserting duplicates into a set has no effect.

3. **Sorting in Decreasing Order**: The unique elements are then sorted in decreasing order:
   ```python
   a.sort(reverse=True)
   ```
   This step aligns with the requirement of constructing array `b` as `S` sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Resulting Array `b`**:
   - The program calculates the number of additional elements (`cnt`) that need to be inserted to make the length of the final array equal to the original array's length.
   - It then iterates through the sorted unique elements and inserts additional elements between them as necessary. The additional elements are one less than the previous element in the new list.
   - This is done in the following loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(len(a)):
         if i > 0:
             adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
             for j in range(adv):
                 ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
             cnt -= adv
             cur -= adv
         ans.append(a[i])
         counter[a[i]] -= 1
         cur += counter[a[i]]
     ```
     The `adv` variable determines the number of additional elements to insert between `a[i-1]` and `a[i]`. The `counter` keeps track of the occurrences of each unique element, and `cur` keeps track of the remaining counts of elements that need to be inserted.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**: If there are still elements to be added to the final array after the loop, they are appended with the following code:
   ```python
   for _ in range(cnt):
       ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
   ```

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the resulting array `b` for each test case:
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

The program correctly implements the logic required to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` as per the problem statement. The logic for inserting additional elements and sorting the unique values ensures that the final array is constructed correctly.
