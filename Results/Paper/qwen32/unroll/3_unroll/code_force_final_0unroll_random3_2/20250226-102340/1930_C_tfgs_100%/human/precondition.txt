Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
