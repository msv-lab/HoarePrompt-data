The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is the loop index and will be initialized by the `range` function, so we do not need to adjust it before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1**
