The provided code snippet only defines a string `alpha` which contains the lowercase English alphabet. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n; `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
