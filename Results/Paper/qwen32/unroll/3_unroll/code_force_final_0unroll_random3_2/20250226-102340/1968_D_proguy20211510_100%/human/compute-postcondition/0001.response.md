The given code snippet only defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This constant is used for modular arithmetic operations, commonly in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow and to ensure results fit within a standard integer range.

Since no other variables are modified or introduced, and no operations are performed on the existing variables, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the introduction of the `MOD` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n; `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007**.
