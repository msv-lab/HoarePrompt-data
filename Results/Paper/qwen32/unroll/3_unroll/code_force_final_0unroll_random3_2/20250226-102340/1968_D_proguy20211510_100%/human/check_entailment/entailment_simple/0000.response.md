### Reasoning:
The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given problem description. Let's break down the program's logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - For both players, the program calculates the path they will take based on the permutation `p` starting from their respective positions `P_B` and `P_S`.
   - It uses a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles in the permutation.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve in `k` turns.
   - This is done by iterating through the path and considering all possible ways to stay or move to the next position in the permutation.
   - The score is calculated by adding the value of the current position `a[i]` for each turn and considering the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players, the program compares them and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input constraints and efficiently calculates the paths and scores.
- The logic for detecting cycles in the permutation is appropriate.
- The score calculation considers all possible moves for each player up to `k` turns.
- The final comparison of scores and printing of the result is accurate.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
