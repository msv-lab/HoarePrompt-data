Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic and scoring mechanism as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that players can stay at their current position or move to `p_x` on each turn, and it does not correctly simulate the game for `k` turns.

Here are some issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**: The program calculates the path for each player by continuously moving to the next position in the permutation until a cycle is detected. This approach does not consider the possibility of staying at the current position, which could lead to a higher score.

2. **Scoring Mechanism**: The program calculates the score by adding the value of `a_x` for each move, but it does not correctly simulate the scenario where a player might choose to stay at the current position to maximize their score. The current implementation assumes that the player will always move to the next position in the permutation, which is not optimal.

3. **Handling of Cycles**: While the program does detect cycles in the permutation, it does not correctly handle the scenario where a player might stay in a cycle to maximize their score. The program simply breaks out of the loop once a cycle is detected, but it does not consider the possibility of staying in the cycle for multiple turns.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The problem requires both players to try to win, which means they should choose the optimal strategy at each turn. The provided program does not simulate this optimal strategy, as it does not consider the possibility of staying at the current position.

To fix these issues, the program would need to simulate the game for `k` turns, considering both the possibility of moving to `p_x` or staying at the current position, and calculate the optimal score for each player based on their starting position. The current implementation does not account for these factors, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

Here is a potential test case that demonstrates the issue:

```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

Explanation:
- Bodya starts at position 3, with `a_3 = 5`. He can either stay at position 3 or move to position 2.
- Sasha starts at position 2, with `a_2 = 2`. He can either stay at position 2 or move to position 1.
- If Bodya stays at position 3 for both turns, his score will be `5 + 5 = 10`.
- If Sasha moves to position 1 on the first turn, his score will be `2 + 7 = 9`.
- Therefore, Bodya wins.

The provided program does not correctly simulate this scenario, leading to an incorrect output.
