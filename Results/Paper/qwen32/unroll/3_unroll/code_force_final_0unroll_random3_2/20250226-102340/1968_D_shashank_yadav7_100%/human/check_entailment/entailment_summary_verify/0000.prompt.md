You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a series of positions and values. For each test case, it determines whether 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' has a higher score based on the given rules, or if it's a 'Draw'. The score is calculated by traversing a list of positions and accumulating values, with a limit on the number of steps (`k`). The function outputs 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategy that each player might use to maximize their score. Instead, it makes a naive assumption that players will only move to the position indicated by the permutation or stay in the same position, without considering other potential optimal moves.

Here are some issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the score for each player. It multiplies the current position's score by the remaining turns and compares it to the total score. This does not correctly simulate the game where scores accumulate over turns.
   
2. **Lack of Optimal Strategy**:
   - The code does not simulate the optimal strategy for each player. Players can choose to stay or move to the position indicated by the permutation, and the code does not correctly handle this decision-making process.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic is flawed. The code decrements `k` and updates the positions and scores, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the player might choose to stay in the same position.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3 2 1 2
2 3 1
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
Sasha
```

Explanation:
- Initial positions: Bodya at position 1 (score 1), Sasha at position 2 (score 2).
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya stays at position 1 (score 1 + 1 = 2).
  - Sasha moves to position 3 (score 2 + 3 = 5).
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya stays at position 1 (score 2 + 1 = 3).
  - Sasha stays at position 3 (score 5 + 3 = 8).
- Final scores: Bodya (3), Sasha (8). Sasha wins.

However, the provided code will not correctly simulate this scenario and might give an incorrect result.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as simulating the game for each player and considering all possible moves to maximize their scores.
