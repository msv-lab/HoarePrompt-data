In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only includes the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
