You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        tmp = a[0]
        aa = set(a)
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of consecutive subarrays in the list `a` that contain the most frequent element. If all elements in `a` are the same, it outputs `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform (all elements the same) by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. If an array is already uniform, it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
2. **Uniform Array Check**: It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set. If `len(set(a)) == 1`, it prints `-1` because the array is already uniform.
3. **Counting Consecutive Elements**: It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to `0`. It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
4. **Finding Minimum Removals**: Whenever it encounters an element different from `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, resets `cnt` to `0`, and updates `tmp` to the new element.
5. **Final Update**: After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the last sequence of elements is considered.
6. **Output**: It prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements. This is not necessarily true. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the longest sequence of consecutive elements is `3` (which appears 4 times), but the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is `3` (removing the first three `3`s).

2. **Handling Multiple Sequences**: The program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple sequences of elements. It only considers the longest sequence of consecutive elements, which might not be the correct approach.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, arrays with alternating patterns (like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`) require a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimum number of removals.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
