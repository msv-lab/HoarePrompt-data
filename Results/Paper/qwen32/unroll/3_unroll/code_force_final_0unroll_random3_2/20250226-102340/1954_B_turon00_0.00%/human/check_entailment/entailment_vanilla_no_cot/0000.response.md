Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed, as it only checks the length of the set of elements and the count of consecutive identical elements from the start, which does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

The correct approach would involve identifying the longest contiguous subarray where each element can be made the same using the given operation. The minimum number of elements to remove would then be the total number of elements minus the length of this subarray. If the entire array can be made uniform using the operation, the result should be -1.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Initialize dp array where dp[i] is the length of the longest subarray ending at i
        dp = [1] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i - 1] == a[i + 1]:
                dp[i + 1] = dp[i] + 1
        
        max_continuous = max(dp)
        
        if max_continuous == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_continuous)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the longest subarray that can be made uniform and determines the minimum number of deletions required.
