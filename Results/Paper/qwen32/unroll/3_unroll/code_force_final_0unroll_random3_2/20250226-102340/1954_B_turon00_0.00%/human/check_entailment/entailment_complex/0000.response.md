### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where we can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighbor if the neighbor on both sides is the same.

The given program attempts to solve this by finding the minimum length of consecutive subarrays that contain the most frequent element. However, this approach does not directly address the problem of making the array non-beautiful.

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same (`len(aa) == 1`). If so, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
2. If not all elements are the same, the program then calculates the minimum length of consecutive subarrays that contain the most frequent element. This is done by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements that are the same. The minimum count of such consecutive elements is stored in `ans`.

However, the minimum length of consecutive subarrays that contain the most frequent element does not necessarily give us the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example:

- Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program would find that the minimum length of consecutive subarrays containing the most frequent element is `1` (since all elements appear only once consecutively). However, removing just one element (e.g., the `2` at index 1 or 3) would make the array non-beautiful. The correct answer here is `1`.

- Consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program would find that the minimum length of consecutive subarrays containing the most frequent element is `3` (since the `3`s appear consecutively in subarrays of length 3). However, removing the `5` and two of the `3`s would make the array non-beautiful with a total of 3 removals. The correct answer here is `3`.

The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It seems to be attempting to find a different metric that doesn't directly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
