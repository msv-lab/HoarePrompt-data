You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: For each test case, the output is the minimum length of consecutive subarrays in the list `a` that contain the most frequent element. If all elements in `a` are the same, the output is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of consecutive subarrays in the list `a` that contain the most frequent element. If all elements in `a` are the same, it outputs `-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Let's analyze the logic of the code and compare it with the problem description.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`) such that `a[i - 1] = a[i + 1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i - 1]`.

The provided code attempts to solve this by counting consecutive elements that are the same and then finding the minimum count of such elements. However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
7
1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```
The correct answer should be `1` because we can remove any one of the `2`s to make the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` or `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, which are not beautiful.

However, the provided code will output `2` for this case. Here's why:
- The code counts consecutive `1`s and `2`s and finds the minimum count of consecutive elements, which is `1` for both `1`s and `2`s.
- But since the array is alternating and removing one `2` will not make it stop being beautiful, the code incorrectly outputs `2`.

### Another Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
The correct answer should be `2` because we can remove the `2`s to make the array `[1, 3, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

However, the provided code will output `1` for this case. Here's why:
- The code counts consecutive `1`s and `2`s and `3`s, and finds the minimum count of consecutive elements, which is `1` for all elements.
- But since the array is not alternating in a way that can be made uniform by removing just one element, the code incorrectly outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails for certain edge cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
