Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) table and its transitions do not align with the rules and objectives of the game.

Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Initialization and DP Table Setup**:
   - The DP table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, but the indices used within the loops and conditions do not match the intended logic.
   - The initial values `dp[n - 1][0] = 0` and `dp[n - 2][0] = 0` are set, but it is unclear why these specific initializations are used and how they relate to the problem.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - The nested loops iterate over the DP table, but the transitions do not properly reflect the game rules:
     - `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`: This condition checks if a specific card number appears in the list, but it does not consider the state of the table or the cards already played.
     - `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`: This condition is also problematic because `cards.count(j + 1)` counts the occurrences in the entire list of cards, not the remaining cards in the player's hand.
     - The transitions such as `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])` do not accurately model the game's decision-making process or scoring rules.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of the players or the state of the table. It does not keep track of which cards have been played or which cards are available to each player.
   - The function `func_1()` does not return the correct maximum score for the player, as the DP transitions and logic are flawed.

### Potential Test Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

The correct output should be `1`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the current implementation will likely not produce the correct result due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the DP table setup, transitions, and overall game logic, the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
