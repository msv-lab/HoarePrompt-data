The code snippet sets `dp[n - 2][0]` to `0`. Since the initial state specifies that `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where all elements are `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is `0`, this assignment does not change any value that was not already `0`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the specific assignment explicitly mentioned.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is `0` and `dp[n - 2][0]` is `0`.**
