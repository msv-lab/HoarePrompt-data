Output State: **`n` is an integer input representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is `0`.**

In simple terms, the value at `dp[n - 1][0]` remains `0`, and all other elements in the `dp` list are still `0`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged.
