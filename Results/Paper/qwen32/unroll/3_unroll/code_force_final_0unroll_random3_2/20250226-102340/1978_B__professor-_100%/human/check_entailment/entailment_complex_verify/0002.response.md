### Reasoning

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the logic used in the program and correctly identifies the conditions and formulas for each case. Let's verify the logic by analyzing the annotated code and the given problem description.

1. **Case 1: \( b \le a \)**
   - **Logic:** If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) will maximize profit.
   - **Formula:** \( n \times a \).
   - **Verification:** The program correctly implements this logic with the condition `if b <= a:`.

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \ge n \)**
   - **Logic:** If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), selling all buns at the modified price will maximize profit. The sum of the first \( n \) terms of the sequence \( (b, b-1, \ldots, b-n+1) \) is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - **Formula:** \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - **Verification:** The program correctly implements this logic with the condition `elif b - a >= n:`.

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - **Logic:** If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is less than the number of buns \( n \), selling the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price will maximize profit.
   - **Formula:** Sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the modified price sequence plus the profit from selling the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
     - Sum of the first \( b - a \) terms: \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} \).
     - Profit from selling the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns: \( a \times (n - (b - a)) \).
   - **Verification:** The program correctly implements this logic with the condition `else:`.

The annotated code and the original assessment both correctly identify and implement the logic for each case. The program handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules.

**Final: True**
