The code snippet provided sorts the `trumps` list in reverse order. Given that the initial state of `trumps` is an empty list `[]`, sorting an empty list does not change it. Therefore, the value of `trumps` remains `[]`. The other variables (`answers` and `suits`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`answers` is ['9H 10H', '7C 8C', 'KD J', 'AS Q'], `trumps` is [], `suits` is {'H': None, 'C': None, 'D': 'K', 'S': 'A'}**
