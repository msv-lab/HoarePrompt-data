Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`). `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_j` satisfies 1 <= `b_j` <= 10^6. The sum of all `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, which is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) and their constraints remain unchanged.
