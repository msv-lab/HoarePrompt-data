Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and an even integer. For each test case, it determines if at least half of the elements in each list are less than or equal to the given even integer. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met for both lists, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
