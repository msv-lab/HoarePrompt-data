You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    18
    98

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: The output state consists of the integer division results of x by 2 for each of the t test cases, printed one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints the result of `x` integer divided by 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). 

The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The gcd of \( x \) and \( y \) is always less than or equal to \( y \), and it is also less than or equal to \( x \).

### Program Analysis:

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \). It then calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) and prints \( y \).

### Reasoning:

Let's consider the correctness of choosing \( y = x // 2 \):

1. **GCD Considerations**: 
   - The gcd of \( x \) and \( y \) where \( y = x // 2 \) is either \( x // 2 \) if \( x \) is even or 1 if \( x \) is odd. This is because \( x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that can divide \( x \) if \( x \) is even.
   - If \( x \) is even, \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = x // 2 \).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = 1 \).

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - For even \( x \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y = (x // 2) + (x // 2) = x \).
   - For odd \( x \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x // 2) \).

3. **Maximizing the Expression**:
   - For even \( x \), \( x // 2 \) is indeed a good choice because it maximizes the gcd part of the expression.
   - For odd \( x \), \( x // 2 \) might not be optimal because \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = 1 \), which is less than the value of \( y \). However, it is not necessarily incorrect, as the problem allows for any \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Checking the Example**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 5 \), \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \), \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). However, \( y = 6 \) gives \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \), which is better.
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 10 \), \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \). However, \( y = 18 \) gives \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \), which is better.
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 50 \), \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \), \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 500 \), \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \), \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

From the above analysis, we can see that the program does not always provide the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), especially for odd numbers. For example, for \( x = 7 \), the optimal \( y \) is 6, not 3.

### Conclusion:

The given program is not always correct because it does not guarantee the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for all test cases, particularly for odd \( x \).
