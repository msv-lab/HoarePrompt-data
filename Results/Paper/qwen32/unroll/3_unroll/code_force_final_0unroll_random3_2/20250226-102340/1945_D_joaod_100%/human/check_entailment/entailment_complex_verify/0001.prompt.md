You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

For each test case, n is the number of people in the queue excluding Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill in the queue. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are the costs Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are the additional costs Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person during a swap (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).

    #State: After processing all test cases, the program will have printed the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach his desired position or better for each test case. The variables `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best` will reflect the state of the last processed test case. Specifically, `cases` will remain unchanged, `na_frente` and `pos_final` will hold the values of the last test case, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` will hold the cost lists of the last test case, `total` will be the total cost accumulated during the processing of the last test case, and `best` will be the minimum cost found for Kirill to reach his desired position or better in the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a queue of people and a cost structure for Kirill to move within the queue. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach a position no greater than a specified maximum allowable final position in the queue.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue by bribing people. The cost of bribing someone to switch places is `a_i`, and the cost of bribing someone to move past them without switching is `b_i`. Kirill needs to determine the minimum cost to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position for Kirill).
2. Reads the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person.
3. Initializes `total` to 0 (total cost) and `best` to a very large number (to track the minimum cost).
4. Iterates from the last person in the queue to the first:
   - If the current position is within the first `m` positions, it updates `best` if the current total cost plus the cost of bribing the current person is less than the current `best`.
   - It then adds the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i` to `total`.
   - If the current position is not within the first `m` positions, it adds the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i` to `total` without updating `best`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The logic for updating `total` and `best` is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the cost of moving past people without switching places. The cost should only be added to `total` if Kirill is actually moving past or switching with that person.
2. **Handling of `best`**: The `best` variable is not correctly updated. It should only be updated when Kirill is within the first `m` positions, but the logic does not correctly handle the cost of moving past people.
3. **Logic for Bribing**: The program does not correctly simulate the process of bribing people to move up the queue. The logic for adding `a_i` or `b_i` to `total` is incorrect and does not reflect the actual process of bribing people.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve using a priority queue or a similar data structure to simulate the process of bribing people efficiently. The program should keep track of the minimum cost to move Kirill to each position and update it based on the costs `a_i` and `b_i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic, it is clear that the provided program is incorrect.
