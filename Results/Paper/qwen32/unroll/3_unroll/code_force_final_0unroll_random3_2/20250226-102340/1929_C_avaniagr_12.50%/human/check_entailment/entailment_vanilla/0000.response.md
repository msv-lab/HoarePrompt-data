Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Sasha starts with `a` coins and wants to be able to achieve any number of coins `n` by placing bets according to the rules:
- Winning a bet of `y` coins gives `y * k` coins, increasing his coins by `y * (k - 1)`.
- Losing a bet of `y` coins reduces his coins by `y`.
- Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

The question is whether, with given `k`, `x`, and `a`, Sasha can guarantee to reach any number of coins `n`.

### Conditions for Winning:
1. **If `x < k - 1`:** 
   - Sasha needs `x + 1` coins to start with to ensure he can manage his losses and wins effectively. This is because he can afford to lose `x` times in a row and still have enough coins to place a bet after that.
   
2. **If `x == k - 1`:**
   - Sasha needs `x + 3` coins to start with. This is a more stringent condition because the number of consecutive losses he can afford is exactly `k - 1`, and he needs more coins to manage the transitions between losses and wins effectively.

3. **If `x > k - 1`:**
   - Sasha needs to calculate a more complex threshold based on the series of bets he can afford. The provided program calculates this threshold by simulating a series of bets and losses up to `x + 1` consecutive losses.

### Program Analysis:
The program correctly implements the logic described above:
- It checks the conditions for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` and prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether `a` meets the required thresholds.
- For `x > k - 1`, it calculates a threshold `z` by simulating a series of bets and losses. This threshold is calculated by iterating up to `x + 1` consecutive losses and updating `z` based on the bet logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee to reach any number of coins `n` based on the given rules and initial conditions.

**Correctness: True**
