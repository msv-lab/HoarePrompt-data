Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The function receives three integers `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 30), `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and `a` (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9) for each test case.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer input by the user. The conditions for the other variables `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case remain as specified in the initial state.
