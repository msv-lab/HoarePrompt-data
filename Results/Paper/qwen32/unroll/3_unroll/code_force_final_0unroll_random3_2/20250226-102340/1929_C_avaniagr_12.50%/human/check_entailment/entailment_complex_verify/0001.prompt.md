You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `k` (the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win), `x` (the maximum number of consecutive losses), and `a` (the initial number of coins Sasha has). For each test case, it determines whether Sasha can continue playing the game without running out of coins based on the given conditions and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
Sasha wants to determine whether he can guarantee that he can have any number of coins `n` by placing bets under the given conditions:
- If he wins, he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins.
- If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
- He starts with `a` coins.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `k`, `x`, and `a`. It then determines whether Sasha can guarantee to have any number of coins based on the following logic:

1. **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
   - If Sasha has at least `x + 1` coins, he can guarantee to have any number of coins.
   - Otherwise, he cannot.
   
2. **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
   - If Sasha has at least `x + 3` coins, he can guarantee to have any number of coins.
   - Otherwise, he cannot.
   
3. **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
   - The program calculates a value `z` which is the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee that Sasha can have any number of coins.
   - `z` is calculated by simulating a series of bets where Sasha loses `x + 1` times in a row but still manages to recover.
   - If Sasha has at least `z` coins, he can guarantee to have any number of coins.
   - Otherwise, he cannot.

### Verification of the Cases

1. **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
   - This case seems reasonable. If Sasha can afford to lose `x` times in a row and still have at least one coin left, he can use a strategy to eventually win enough to cover any loss and have any number of coins.
   
2. **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
   - This case is also reasonable. The additional requirement of `x + 3` coins seems to account for the fact that Sasha needs more coins to recover from the maximum allowed losses and still be able to make further bets.
   
3. **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
   - The calculation of `z` is more complex. The program simulates a series of bets to determine the minimum number of coins needed. This approach seems to be an attempt to accurately calculate the minimum coins required to guarantee any number of coins despite losing up to `x` times in a row.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly handle the different cases based on the relationship between `x` and `k`. It calculates the minimum number of coins needed for each case and checks if Sasha has at least that many coins. Thus, the program seems to be correct based on the provided logic and the problem description.
