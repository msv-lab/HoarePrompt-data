You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum score according to the problem description. The logic for calculating the maximum score is flawed.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling of `k >= n * m` case:**
   - The program calculates the factorial of `n` when `k >= n * m`, which is correct because in this case, you can make all cards have at least `m` occurrences, and the number of permutations of `n` distinct elements is `n!`. However, this part seems correct.

2. **Handling of `k < n * m` case:**
   - The program tries to distribute the remaining `k` cards after setting each card type to `m` occurrences but the logic for this distribution and subsequent calculation of `ans` is incorrect.
   - Specifically, the line `ans = a[0]` and the subsequent loop `for i in range(1, n): ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` do not correctly compute the number of valid subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the number of valid permutations of length `n` that can be formed with the adjusted counts of each card type. The correct approach involves using combinatorial mathematics to count valid permutations.

Here's a corrected approach outline:
- If `k >= n * m`, the answer is `n!` as explained.
- If `k < n * m`, distribute the remaining `k` cards optimally to maximize the number of valid permutations. This involves ensuring that each card type count is as balanced as possible.
- The number of valid permutations can be computed using multinomial coefficients, which account for the counts of each card type.

Given the complexity of the correct implementation, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and thus it is incorrect.
