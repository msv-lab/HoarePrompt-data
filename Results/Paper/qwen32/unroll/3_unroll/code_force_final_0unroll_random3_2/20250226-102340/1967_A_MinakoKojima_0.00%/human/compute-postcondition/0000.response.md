The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `int(input())`. Since the loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. Since the problem states that `1 <= t <= 100`, the loop will always execute with the given constraints. However, if we strictly adhere to the requirement of adjusting only the states of objects in the loop head, we can confirm that `t` is already in the correct state as per the problem constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
