Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee that it will find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized using at most `3n` queries. Here's an analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Finding `maxi`**:
   The program first tries to find the index `maxi` such that the value `p_maxi` is the largest in the permutation. It does this by comparing `p_maxi` with each `p_i` for `i` from `1` to `n-1`. This part is correct and uses `n-1` queries.

2. **Finding `arr`**:
   Next, the program tries to find a set of indices `arr` such that `p_i` for `i` in `arr` are candidates for the second index `j` that will maximize `p_maxi ⊕ p_j`. It does this by comparing `p_maxi` with `p_i` for `i` from `1` to `n-1` again. This part is also correct and uses `n-1` queries.

3. **Finding `mini`**:
   The program then tries to find the index `mini` in `arr` such that `p_mini` is the smallest in `arr`. This part is intended to find a candidate for `j` that will maximize `p_maxi ⊕ p_j`. However, this approach is flawed. The smallest value in `arr` does not necessarily lead to the maximum XOR with `p_maxi`.

The XOR operation is maximized when the bits of the two numbers are as different as possible. The provided program does not ensure that the chosen `mini` will result in the maximum XOR with `p_maxi`. The program should consider the bits of the numbers more carefully to ensure that the XOR is maximized.

A correct approach would involve checking the bits of the numbers more thoroughly, possibly using a strategy that involves more queries but ensures the maximum XOR is found. The current program does not guarantee the correct result for all possible permutations, thus it is incorrect.
