The provided code performs a series of operations to determine the maximum and minimum elements in a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to `n-1`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

1. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` (the size of the permutation).
2. It initializes `maxi` to 0 and then iterates through the permutation to find the maximum element. It does this by comparing each element `i` with `maxi` using the query `? maxi maxi i i`. If the response is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`.
3. After identifying the maximum element, it initializes `arr` with `maxi` and then iterates through the permutation again to find all elements that are equal to `maxi`. It does this by comparing each element `i` with the first element of `arr` using the query `? maxi arr[0] maxi i`. If the response is `<`, it updates `arr` to `[i]`. If the response is `=`, it appends `i` to `arr`.
4. It then identifies the minimum element among the elements in `arr` (which are all equal to `maxi` initially). It does this by comparing each element in `arr` with `mini` (initially set to the first element of `arr`) using the query `? mini mini item item`. If the response is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum and minimum elements found.

Given that the code is designed to find the maximum and minimum elements of the permutation `p`, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be the maximum and minimum values of the permutation for each test case.

Output State: **For each test case, the maximum and minimum elements of the permutation p are printed.**
