The code snippet initializes a list named `ans` with `n` elements, all set to the value \(10^9\). This operation does not affect the values of `arr`, `n`, `t`, or any other variables that might be present in the initial state. The only change is to the `ans` list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(x_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), the length of `arr` is \(n-1\), `t` satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\). `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is \(10^9\).**
