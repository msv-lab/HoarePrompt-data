Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(x_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), the length of `arr` is \(n-1\), `t` satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\). `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is \(10^9\). `i` is assigned the value \(n - 2\).**

In natural language, the output state is: `arr` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, the length of `arr` is still \(n-1\), `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases still does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\). `ans` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is \(10^9\). The variable `i` is now assigned the value \(n - 2\).
