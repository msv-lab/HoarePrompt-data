### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first counting the number of 'F' and 'S' relationships for each scenario. It then determines which scenarios have only 'F' relationships and which have only 'S' relationships. Depending on which list (`sa` or `sb`) is longer, it assigns the remaining '?' characters in the transition matrix to either 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in the longer list.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Handling of '?' Assignments**: The program assigns '?' to 'F' or 'S' based on whether the index is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `sb`. This is an arbitrary and incorrect way to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear. It does not guarantee that the condition will be satisfied for all permutations of scenarios.

2. **Condition for Consecutive Videos**: The program does not explicitly check that for any permutation of scenarios, no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear. It only assigns '?' based on the length of `sa` and `sb`, which is insufficient to ensure the required condition.

3. **Arbitrary Assignment**: The logic for assigning '?' is based on the length of `sa` and `sb` and does not consider the overall distribution of 'F' and 'S' videos across all permutations of scenarios.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned, the program does not guarantee that the output will satisfy the condition of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
