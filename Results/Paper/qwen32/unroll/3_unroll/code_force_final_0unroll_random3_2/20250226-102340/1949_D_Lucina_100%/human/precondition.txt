n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at position (i, j) is the same as the character at position (j, i) for all i and j. There are at most floor(n/2) characters that are either 'F' or 'S'.
