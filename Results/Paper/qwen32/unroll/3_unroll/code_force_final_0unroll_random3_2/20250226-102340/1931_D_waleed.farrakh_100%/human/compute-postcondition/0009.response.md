To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables.

Given:
- `results` is the output of `func_1(test_cases)`.
- The loop iterates over each `result` in `results` and prints it.

The loop itself does not modify `test_cases`, `data`, `t`, or `idx`. It only iterates over `results` and prints each element.

Since the loop's primary action is printing each `result` from `results`, the state of `results` remains unchanged after the loop. The other variables (`test_cases`, `data`, `t`, `idx`) are not affected by the loop.

Thus, the output state will be the same as the initial state with the exception that the contents of `results` will have been printed.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `(n, x, y, arr)` for each test case; `data` is unchanged; `t` is unchanged; `idx` is `1 + 2*t`; `results` is the output of `func_1(test_cases)`.**
