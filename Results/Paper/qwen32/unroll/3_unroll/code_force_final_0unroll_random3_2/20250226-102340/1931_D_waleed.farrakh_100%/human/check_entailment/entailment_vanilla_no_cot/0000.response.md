Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_1(test_cases)`**:
   - This function takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - It iterates through each element in the array `arr` and calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
   - If the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count` of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, splits the input into lines, and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `x`, and `y` followed by the array `arr`.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - It calls `func_1(test_cases)` to get the results for all test cases and prints each result.

The program efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequencies of the pairs, ensuring that the solution is optimal and works within the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
