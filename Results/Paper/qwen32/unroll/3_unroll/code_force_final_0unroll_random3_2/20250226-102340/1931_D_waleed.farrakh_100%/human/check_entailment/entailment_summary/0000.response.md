### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break down the logic and correctness of each function based on the problem description and the execution summaries:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function processes a list of test cases where each test case includes an array `arr` and two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array.
   - **Logic**:
     - It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.
     - For each element `a` in the array:
       - It calculates the remainders `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
       - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before in `freq`. If it has, it adds the count of that pair to the `count` variable.
       - It then updates the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
     - The function returns a list of counts, one for each test case.
   - **Execution Summary**: The function correctly processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs based on the criteria provided in the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads all input data at once and splits it into lines.
     - It extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr`.
     - It collects all test cases in a list and passes them to `func_1` for processing.
     - It prints the results returned by `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Execution Summary**: The function correctly reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and outputs the results.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work in tandem to solve the problem as described. `func_2` handles input/output, while `func_1` performs the core logic of counting beautiful pairs. The execution summaries provided align with the expected behavior of the functions based on the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
