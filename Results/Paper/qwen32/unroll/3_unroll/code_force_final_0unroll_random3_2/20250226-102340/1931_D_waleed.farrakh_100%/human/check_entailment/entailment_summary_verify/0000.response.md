### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (with \(1 \le i < j \le n\)) is considered beautiful if:
  1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1(test_cases)`:
- It initializes an empty list `results` to store the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
- For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)`, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` and a counter `count`.
- For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates:
  - \(rx = (-a \% x + x) \% x\)
  - \(ry = a \% y\)
- It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it does, it increments the `count` by the frequency of this pair.
- It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- Processes each test case and collects them in a list `test_cases`.
- Calls `func_1(test_cases)` to get the results.
- Prints the results for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_2()` reads input, processes multiple test cases using `func_1()`, and prints the results.

### Verification of `func_1(test_cases)`:

#### Correctness of Remainder Calculation:
- \(rx = (-a \% x + x) \% x\) ensures that `rx` is non-negative and represents the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`.
- \(ry = a \% y\) is straightforward and correct.

#### Counting Beautiful Pairs:
- The logic for counting beautiful pairs is based on the idea that for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the remainders must satisfy:
  - \(rx_i + rx_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
  - \(ry_i \equiv ry_j \pmod{y}\)
- The program checks if the complement remainder pair \((rx, ry)\) has been seen before and increments the count accordingly.

#### Handling Multiple Test Cases:
- The program processes each test case independently and collects results in a list, which is then printed.

#### Efficiency:
- The program processes each element of the array in constant time, making it efficient even for large arrays.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Example Input:**
```
7
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
7 9 5
1 10 15 3 8 12 15
9 4 10
14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6
9 5 6
10 7 6 7 9 7 7 10 10
9 6 2
4 9 7 1 2 2 13 3 15
9 2 3
14 6 1 15 12 15 8 2 15
10 5 7
13 3 3 2 12 11 3 7 13 14
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0
1
3
5
7
0
```

The program should correctly output the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. There are no obvious edge cases or issues that would cause the program to fail.

**Final:** **True**. The program is correct.
