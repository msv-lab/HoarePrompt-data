Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, two favorite integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. The function collects these test cases, passes them to `func_1` for processing, and outputs the results returned by `func_1`.**
