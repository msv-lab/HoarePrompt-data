The code snippet `results = func_1(test_cases)` implies that the function `func_1` is called with `test_cases` as an argument, and the result of this function call is stored in the variable `results`. The other variables (`data`, `t`, and `idx`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Given that the initial state specifies that `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `(n, x, y, arr)`, we can infer that `func_1` processes these test cases and returns some results. However, the specific nature of `func_1` and the exact results it returns are not provided, so we can only assume that `results` will hold whatever `func_1` outputs.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `(n, x, y, arr)` for each test case; `data` is unchanged; `t` is unchanged; `idx` is `1 + 2*t`; `results` is the output of `func_1(test_cases)`.**
