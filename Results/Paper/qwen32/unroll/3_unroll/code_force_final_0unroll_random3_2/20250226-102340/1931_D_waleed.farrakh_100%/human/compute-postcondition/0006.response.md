To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand how the variables are being modified within the loop.

1. `t` is the number of iterations the loop will run, which is the integer value of `data[0]`.
2. For each iteration, the loop reads two lines from `data` starting from `idx`:
   - The first line (at `data[idx]`) contains three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - The second line (at `data[idx + 1]`) contains `n` integers which are stored in the list `arr`.
3. A tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is then appended to the `test_cases` list.
4. `idx` is incremented by 2 to move to the next pair of lines for the next iteration.

After all iterations, `test_cases` will contain `t` tuples, each representing the data for one test case.

Let's summarize the final state of the variables:
- `test_cases` will be a list of tuples, each tuple containing `(n, x, y, arr)` for each test case.
- `data` remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- `t` remains unchanged as it defines the number of iterations.
- `idx` will be `1 + 2*t` because it starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 for each of the `t` iterations.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `(n, x, y, arr)` for each test case, `data` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `idx` is `1 + 2*t`.**
