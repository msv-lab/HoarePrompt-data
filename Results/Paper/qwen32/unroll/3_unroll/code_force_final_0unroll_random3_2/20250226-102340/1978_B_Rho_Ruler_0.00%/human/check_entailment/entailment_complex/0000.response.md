Reasoning:
The given program is intended to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns with a promotional pricing strategy. The binary search approach is used to determine the optimal number `k` of buns to sell at the modified price. However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the `func_1` function and the logic used to determine the maximum profit.

The function `func_1` is supposed to evaluate whether selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price results in a profit that is better than the current best profit. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not calculate the actual profit; instead, it checks if the sum of the total price of `k` buns at the modified price and `n-k` buns at the usual price is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition does not make sense for determining the maximum profit.

To correctly determine the maximum profit, the function should calculate the total revenue from selling `k` buns at the modified price and `n-k` buns at the usual price, and then compare this revenue with the revenue from selling all buns at the usual price. The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of `k` and keeping track of the maximum profit obtained.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly compute the maximum profit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
