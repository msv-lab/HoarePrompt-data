Precondition: **k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.**

Note: The function definition provided (`def func_1(k, a, b, n):`) does not match the problem description, as the problem states that `k` is chosen by Bob to maximize profit and is not an input. The correct function definition should only take `n`, `a`, and `b` as inputs, like so: `def func_1(n, a, b):`
