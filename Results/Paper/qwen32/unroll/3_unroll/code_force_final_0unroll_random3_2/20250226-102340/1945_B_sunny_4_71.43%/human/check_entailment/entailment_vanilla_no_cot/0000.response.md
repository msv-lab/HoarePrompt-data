Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program simply calculates the number of fireworks each installation can launch within the visibility period `m` and sums them up, which does not account for overlaps in visibility times between fireworks from the two installations.

To correctly solve the problem, one must consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and then calculate the number of fireworks visible at the same time based on this periodicity. The correct approach involves more complex calculations involving the LCM and the visibility intervals.
