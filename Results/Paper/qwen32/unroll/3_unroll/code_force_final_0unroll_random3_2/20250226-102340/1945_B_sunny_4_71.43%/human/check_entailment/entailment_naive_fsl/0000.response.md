Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` and adds them together, which does not account for overlapping visibility periods between fireworks launched by the two installations.

Let's consider the third example provided in the problem description:

- For the input `7 8 56`, the program calculates `A` as `int(56 / 7) + 1 = 9` and `B` as `int(56 / 8) + 1 = 8`, and then prints `A + B = 17`.

However, the correct answer is `17`, but the explanation given in the problem description shows that there are 9 fireworks from the first installation and 8 fireworks from the second installation, but they overlap at certain points. Specifically, at minute 56, both installations launch fireworks, and these fireworks are visible from minute 56 to 112, inclusive. Therefore, at minute 56, 17 fireworks are visible, but at other times, the number of visible fireworks will be less due to the overlaps.

The program does not account for these overlaps and simply adds the counts, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and calculate the number of overlapping fireworks within the visibility duration `m`.
