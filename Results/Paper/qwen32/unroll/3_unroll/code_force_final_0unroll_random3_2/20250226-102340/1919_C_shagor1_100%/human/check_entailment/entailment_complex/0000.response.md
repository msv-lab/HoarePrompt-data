### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by maintaining two variables, `la` and `lb`, which represent the smallest and the second smallest elements encountered so far in the sequence. The idea is to split the sequence into two subsequences such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty is essentially the number of times a subsequence has an increasing pair of elements. 

The program iterates through the input array and updates `la` and `lb` based on the current element. If the current element is less than or equal to `la`, it updates `la`. If it's greater than `la` but less than or equal to `lb`, it updates `lb`. If the current element is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it implies that there's a new increasing pair in the sequence, and the penalty is incremented by 1. The values of `la` and `lb` are then updated to the last two elements of the increasing subsequence.

The logic behind this approach is that by maintaining `la` and `lb`, the program is effectively keeping track of the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed without increasing the penalty. When a new element is found that is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it means that the current subsequence has ended, and a new one is starting, thus increasing the penalty.

The program then prints the total penalty for each test case.

### Verification Against Examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: A valid split is `s=[2,4,5]` and `t=[1,3]`. The penalty is `p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `8 8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: A valid split is `s=[8,3,1]` and `t=[2,1,7,4,3]`. The penalty is `p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 3 3 3 3 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: A valid split is `s=[]` and `t=[3,3,3,3,3]`. The penalty is `p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: A valid split is `s=[]` and `t=[1]`. The penalty is `p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0`.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 2 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: A valid split is `s=[2]` and `t=[1]`. The penalty is `p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case. The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.

**Correctness: True**
