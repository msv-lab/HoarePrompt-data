#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), representing the size of the array a. The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, and `n` integers representing the elements of the array. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided array elements.
