To understand the output state, let's analyze the provided code:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, two integers `n` and `k` are read. Here, `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
3. An array `array` is created with elements from 1 to `n`.
4. An `answer` list is initialized with the first element as 1.
5. Another list `a` is initialized with `[1, -1]`.
6. A loop runs from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive):
    - If `i` is odd (`(-1) ** i == -1`), the next element in the `answer` list is taken from the `array` at the index `a[-1]` (which is initially -1), and `a[-1]` is decremented.
    - If `i` is even (`(-1) ** i == 1`), the next element in the `answer` list is taken from the `array` at the index `a[0]` (which is initially 1), and `a[0]` is incremented.
7. The `answer` list is printed after each test case.

Given the behavior of the loop, let's deduce the output pattern:

- For `i = 1` (odd), the element at index `-1` of `array` is taken, which is the last element of `array` (since Python allows negative indexing).
- For `i = 2` (even), the element at index `1` of `array` is taken.
- For `i = 3` (odd), the element at index `-2` of `array` is taken.
- For `i = 4` (even), the element at index `2` of `array` is taken.
- This pattern continues until all elements from `array` are used.

So, the `answer` list will contain elements from `array` in the following order: the first element, the last element, the second element, the second last element, and so on.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the `answer` list will be a rearrangement of the `array` where elements are picked alternately from the start and end of the `array`.

Output State: **For each test case, the output is a rearranged list of integers from 1 to n, where elements are picked alternately from the start and end of the list.**
