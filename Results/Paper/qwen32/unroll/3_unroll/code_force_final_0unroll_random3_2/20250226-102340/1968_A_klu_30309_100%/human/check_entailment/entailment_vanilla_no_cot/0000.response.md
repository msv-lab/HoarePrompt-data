Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it incorrectly breaks out of the loop after the first iteration, which means it only checks the largest possible value of y (which is x-1) and does not find the optimal y that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

To fix the program, the `break` statement should be removed so that the loop continues to check all possible values of y from x-1 down to 1. This ensures that the program finds the y that gives the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Here's the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
