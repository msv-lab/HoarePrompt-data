The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the sum of the integers in a specified sub-list meets a certain condition compared to a derived cumulative sum list. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met (except when the sub-list has only one element), otherwise it prints 'NO'.
