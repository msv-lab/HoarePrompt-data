Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but operates based on predefined inputs. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function returns the sum of the integers in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` inclusive.**
