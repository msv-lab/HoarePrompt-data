The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and `n` and `q` are integers that will be defined by the input for each test case. The list `c` and the queries `l_i` and `r_i` are not affected by this particular code snippet.

After executing the code, `n` and `q` will hold the values read from the input, while `t`, `c`, and the queries remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
