The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and constructs a new list `a` where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers read from the input. The values of `n`, `q`, `c`, `t`, and the queries remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are integers read from the input.**
