Output State: **The output state consists of the integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks available, and the list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is still 0. The variable `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that length appears in the list.**
