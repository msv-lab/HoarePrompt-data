Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. The current implementation only checks for the number of squares (polygons with 4 sides) that can be formed by counting sticks in multiples of 4. However, the problem statement requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons with any number of sides, not just squares.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
With six sticks of length 2, we can form a regular hexagon (6-sided polygon).

However, the provided program will output `0` for this input because it only counts sets of 4 sticks (which would form squares), and there are no sets of 4 sticks in this test case.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
