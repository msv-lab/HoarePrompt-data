Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is specified to be within the range of 1 to 10,000. The other variables (`n` and `a`) and their conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
