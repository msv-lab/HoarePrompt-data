You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is even and `n // 2 * 3` is 200 or more, it outputs 'NO'. The values of `t` and `n` for each test case remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Character Set**: The problem requires the string to be made up of uppercase Latin letters (A-Z). However, the program constructs the string using the characters '1', '1', and '0', which are digits, not letters.

2. **Logic for Special Characters**: The logic in the program for determining whether a string can have exactly `n` special characters is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that `n` must be even and constructs a string using the pattern '110'. This pattern does not guarantee that the string will have exactly `n` special characters.

3. **String Length**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200, but it does not ensure that the string meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

- **Input**: `n = 6`
- **Program Output**:
  ```
  YES
  110110
  ```

  In the output string "110110", the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. However, the string is not made up of uppercase Latin letters, and the logic for determining the number of special characters is incorrect.

To fix the program, we need to construct a string using uppercase Latin letters and ensure that the string has exactly `n` special characters. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 0:
            print('YES')
            print('')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')
        else:
            # Construct a string with exactly n special characters
            # Example: For n = 3, the string could be "AABAC"
            s = 'A' * (n + 1) + 'B' + 'A' * (n - 1) + 'C'
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- For `n = 1`, the string "AA" has exactly one special character.
- For `n > 1`, the string is constructed to have exactly `n` special characters using uppercase Latin letters.
