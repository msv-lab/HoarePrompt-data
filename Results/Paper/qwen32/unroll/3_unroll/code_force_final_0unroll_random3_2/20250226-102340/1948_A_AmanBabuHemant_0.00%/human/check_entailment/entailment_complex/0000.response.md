### Reasoning:
The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The provided program follows this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in the string as each special character must be flanked by different characters on either side (except at the boundaries), leading to an even number of special characters.
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating the pattern "110" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters, because each "1" is special (it is equal to the preceding "1" but not the following "0", and vice versa for each "0").
5. It checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200. If so, it prints "YES" followed by the string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The provided program, however, is using the string "110" instead of uppercase Latin letters. This is a mistake because the problem specifies that the string must consist of uppercase Latin letters.

To correct this, the program should use a pattern of uppercase Latin letters that satisfies the condition of having exactly `n` special characters. For example, the pattern "AAAB" can be used where 'A' is special (it is equal to the preceding 'A' but not the following 'B', and vice versa for each 'B').

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it uses the string "110" instead of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement. The logic for determining the existence of a suitable string is correct, but the implementation needs to use valid characters.
