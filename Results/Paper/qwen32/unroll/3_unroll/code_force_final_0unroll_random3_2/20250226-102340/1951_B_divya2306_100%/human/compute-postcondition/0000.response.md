Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; The list `a` contains `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise distinct; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, while `t`, the list `a`, and the conditions on `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
