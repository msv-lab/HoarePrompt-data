Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; The list `a` contains `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise distinct; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`; `wins` is less than `k`; `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the output state means that the value of `win_with_swap` has been updated to be one more than the value of `wins`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
