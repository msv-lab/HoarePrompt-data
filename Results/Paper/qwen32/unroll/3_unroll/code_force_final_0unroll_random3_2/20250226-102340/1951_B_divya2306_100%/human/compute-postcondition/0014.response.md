Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of positions that can be won by potentially swapping elements in the list `a` up to the `k`-th position, based on the values of the elements relative to `a[k-1]`. The function does not return any value.**
