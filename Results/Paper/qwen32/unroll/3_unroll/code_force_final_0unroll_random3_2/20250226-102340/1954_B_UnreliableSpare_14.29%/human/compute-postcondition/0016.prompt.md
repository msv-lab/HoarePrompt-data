You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Since the loop only modifies the `flag` variable, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `arr` are not affected by the loop, the output state will be:
    #
    #- `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `a` remains the same.
    #- `arr` remains the same.
    #- `flag` will be `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` will be `False`.
    #
    #Output State:
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: - `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` before a different element is encountered, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if all elements are equal to `val`.
    #- `val` remains `arr[0]`.
    #- `cnt` will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
    #
    #However, without the specific array `arr` and the value of `n`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ans` and `cnt`. Therefore, the most accurate output state we can specify based on the given information is:
    #
    #Output State:
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt)
    #State: `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`; `val` remains `arr[0]`; `cnt` remains unchanged; `flag` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition evaluated.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It computes and returns a result based on the properties of the list `a`, which is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
