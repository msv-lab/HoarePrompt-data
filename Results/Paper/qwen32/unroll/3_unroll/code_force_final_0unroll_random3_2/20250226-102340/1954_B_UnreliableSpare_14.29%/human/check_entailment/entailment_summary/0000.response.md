Reasoning:  
The provided program is not correctly solving the problem as described. The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. The program incorrectly attempts to find the minimum length of any contiguous subarray where all elements are the same, which does not directly address the problem's requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it correctly outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.
2. If the array is not uniform, the program attempts to find the minimum length of any contiguous subarray where all elements are the same. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
3. The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt the "beautiful" property of the array. The "beautiful" property allows elements to be changed based on a specific rule (choosing an index `i` where `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` and replacing `a_i` with `a_{i - 1}`). The correct solution would involve analyzing the structure of the array and determining the minimal disruption to this property.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
