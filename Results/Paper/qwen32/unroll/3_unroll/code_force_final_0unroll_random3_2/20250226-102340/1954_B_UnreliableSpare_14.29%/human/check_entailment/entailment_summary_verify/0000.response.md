Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. If it's impossible to do so, we return -1.

### Provided Code Analysis

The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself. It then checks if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because a uniform array remains beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

If the array is not uniform, it attempts to find the minimum length of any contiguous subarray where all elements are the same. The idea is that removing such a subarray might help break the "beautiful" property of the array.

### Function Summary
The function summary accurately describes the code's behavior. It reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `arr` where all elements are the same.

### Issues in the Code
The main issue in the code is the incorrect logic for finding the minimum length of contiguous subarrays where all elements are the same. The code initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and updates it with the length of segments of identical elements. However, the logic for identifying the end of one segment and the start of another is flawed.

### Detailed Explanation of Issues
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is intended to store the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify and handle all such segments.
   - The code initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and updates it with the length of segments of identical elements. However, it fails to correctly identify when a segment ends and a new one begins.
   - The code only updates `ans` when it encounters a different element, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where the last segment might be the shortest.

2. **Handling of Identical Elements:**
   - The code correctly identifies if all elements are identical and returns `-1` if they are.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum segment length is flawed. The code does not correctly identify all segments of identical elements and does not handle cases where multiple segments of different lengths coexist.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
1 2 2 1 2 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `[1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]` is beautiful.
- To make it stop being beautiful, we can remove two elements, for example, the two middle `2`s, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, indicating that it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion
The program fails to correctly handle cases where multiple segments of identical elements exist and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
