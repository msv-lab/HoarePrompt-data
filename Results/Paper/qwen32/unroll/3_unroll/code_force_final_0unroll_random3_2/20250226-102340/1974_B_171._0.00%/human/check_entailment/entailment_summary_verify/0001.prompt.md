You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a new string where each unique character in the input is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z', preserving the order of their first appearance.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to decode the string by assigning the first unused character in the alphabet to each new character it encounters in the encoded string. This approach does not take into account the symmetric relationship defined in the problem statement, which requires using a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string and mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Construction of `r`:** The program does not construct the string `r` as described, which consists of all distinct letters in the encoded string in alphabetical order.
2. **Symmetric Mapping:** The program does not create a symmetric mapping based on the string `r`. Instead, it assigns the first unused character in the alphabet to each new character in the encoded string, which is incorrect.
3. **Decoding Process:** The decoding process should involve finding the symmetric character of each character in the encoded string based on the constructed string `r`, but the program does not do this.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:
- Extract all distinct characters from the encoded string and sort them to form the string `r`.
- Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.
- Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
