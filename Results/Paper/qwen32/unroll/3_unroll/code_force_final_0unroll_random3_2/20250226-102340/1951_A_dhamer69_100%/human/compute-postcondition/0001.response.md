To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `t > 0`. The variables `start` and `end` do not affect the execution of this loop, so we only need to adjust the variable `t`.

Given the condition `t > 0`, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

State right before the while loop: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.

To make sure the loop can execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
