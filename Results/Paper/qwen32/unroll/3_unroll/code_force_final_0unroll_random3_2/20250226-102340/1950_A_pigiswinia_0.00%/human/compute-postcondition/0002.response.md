Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Given the loop and the initial state, the loop will execute `t` times. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and prints 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions specified. After all iterations, the only variables that will have changed are those inside the loop: `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t` will remain unchanged as it controls the number of iterations.

Since the loop modifies `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration based on the input, and `i` is simply an iteration counter, their final values after the loop will be the values from the last iteration. However, these values are not stored or accumulated in any way that affects the overall output state beyond the print statements.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the final print statement's condition result from the last test case. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those from the last input, and `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes.

Output State: **`i` is `t`, and `a`, `b`, `c` are the values from the last test case, with the final print statement being 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the last test case's values.**
