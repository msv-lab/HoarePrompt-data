Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not work correctly for the given problem description because it prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" when the digits form a stair. The problem description explicitly states that the output should be "STAIR" when the digits form a stair, not "STAIRS". 

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
if a < b < c:
    print('STAIRS')  # This should be 'STAIR'
```

For example, for the input `1 2 3`, the correct output should be `STAIR`, but the program outputs `STAIRS`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
