You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Stair Condition**: `a < b < c`
2. **Peak Condition**: `a < b > c`
3. **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, it should be "NONE".

### Program Analysis:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIRS".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

### Issues Identified:
The only issue in the provided program is a typo in the string that should be printed for the stair condition. The program prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR".

### Corrected Output:
The correct output for the stair condition should be "STAIR" (without an 'S' at the end).

### Conclusion:
Because of the typo in the string "STAIRS", the program does not produce the correct output for the stair condition and thus does not fully meet the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
