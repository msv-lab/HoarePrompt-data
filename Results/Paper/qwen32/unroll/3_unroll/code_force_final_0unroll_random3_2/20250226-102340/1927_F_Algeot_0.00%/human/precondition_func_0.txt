The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (3 ≤ n) and m (n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2 * 10^5)) representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The next m lines each contain three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and no loops. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
