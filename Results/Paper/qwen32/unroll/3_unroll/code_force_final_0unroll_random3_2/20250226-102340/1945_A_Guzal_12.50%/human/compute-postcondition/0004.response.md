Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these integers. The printed value is either `-1` if certain conditions are not met, or the total number of individuals adjusted by the number of extroverts and universals divided by three, with an additional increment if the sum of extroverts and universals is not divisible by three.**
