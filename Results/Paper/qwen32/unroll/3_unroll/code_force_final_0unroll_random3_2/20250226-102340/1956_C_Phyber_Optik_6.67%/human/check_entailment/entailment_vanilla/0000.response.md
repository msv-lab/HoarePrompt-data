Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations.
2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Assign a row `i` with a permutation `p` of integers from `1` to `n`.
   - **Type 2**: Assign a column `i` with a permutation `p` of integers from `1` to `n`.
3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the maximum sum and the number of operations used.
   - Describe each operation by its type, the row/column it affects, and the permutation used.

### Provided Program Analysis:

The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case:
1. It reads the size of the matrix `n`.
2. It initializes `sum` to `0` and `r` to `0`.
3. It then iterates from `1` to `n`:
   - If the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`n*(n+1)//2`) is greater than `i*n`, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n*(n+1)//2` to `sum`.
   - Otherwise, it adds `i*n` to `sum`.
4. It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (`n + r`).
5. It then prints the operations:
   - For the first `n` operations, it sets each row `j` to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For the remaining `r` operations, it sets each column `j % n` to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:

1. **Calculation of `sum` and `r`**:
   - The logic for calculating `sum` and `r` is incorrect. The program does not properly calculate the maximum possible sum for the matrix.
   - The maximum possible sum for an `n x n` matrix where each row and each column is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` is `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`, which is the sum of all numbers from `1` to `n` repeated `n` times in each row and each column.

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program outputs `n + r` operations, but it does not ensure that `r` is correctly calculated to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The program should perform `n` row operations and `n` column operations to achieve the maximum sum, totaling `2n` operations.

3. **Output of Operations**:
   - The operations are not correctly outputted to achieve the maximum sum. The program should perform `n` row operations and `n` column operations, each using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not properly output the operations to achieve this sum.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Approach:

The correct approach would be to:
1. Calculate the maximum sum as `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`.
2. Perform `n` row operations, each setting a row to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
3. Perform `n` column operations, each setting a column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

This ensures the maximum sum is achieved with exactly `2n` operations.
