### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix where each cell can be filled using two types of operations, each of which involves permuting a row or a column of the matrix. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix with no more than \( 2n \) operations.

The provided program calculates the maximum sum and the operations required to achieve that sum. Let's break down the program to see if it meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the matrix by iterating through each row and adding the maximum possible sum for that row.
   - For each row \( i \), if the total sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers (\( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \)) is greater than \( i \times n \), it adds the total sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers to the sum. Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to the sum.
   - This logic seems incorrect. The correct approach would be to simply add the total sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers for each row, which is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), because each row can be filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] to maximize the sum.

2. **Operations Output:**
   - The program outputs \( n + r \) operations, where \( r \) seems to be incorrectly calculated based on the sum condition.
   - It outputs type 1 operations for the first \( n \) rows, filling each row with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].
   - For the remaining \( r \) operations, it outputs type 2 operations, filling each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]. However, the calculation of \( r \) is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or the operations required to achieve that sum. The sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) (since each row can be filled optimally with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]), and the operations should be exactly \( n \) type 1 operations (filling each row optimally).

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
