Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and the corresponding operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The program tries to calculate the sum by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` for certain rows and `i * n` for others, which doesn't align with the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix. The maximum sum is simply the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is `n^2 * (n^2 + 1) / 2`. This is because each cell in the matrix can be set to a unique value from 1 to `n^2` using the operations allowed.

2. **Operations:**
   The operations described in the output are not correctly forming the permutations that would achieve the maximum sum. The program is supposed to fill the matrix in such a way that each row and column is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The current implementation does not guarantee this and does not correctly describe the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Number of Operations:**
   The number of operations `m` should be no more than `2n`. While the program attempts to generate operations, they are not correctly formed and do not ensure the maximum sum.

### Counter-Example:
Let's consider the case when `n = 2`:

- **Expected Output:**
  - The maximum sum is `7` (which is `1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7` if we fill the matrix as follows: `[[1, 2], [3, 1]]` or similar configurations).
  - Operations could be:
    ```
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    ```
  - This results in the matrix:
    ```
    1 2
    1 2
    ```
  - Sum = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 (incorrect, the correct maximum sum is 7).

- **Actual Output from the Program:**
  - The program outputs `7 3` for the sum and number of operations, which seems correct at first glance, but the operations are not correctly formed.
  - The operations are:
    ```
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    ```
  - This results in the matrix:
    ```
    1 2
    1 2
    ```
  - Sum = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 (incorrect, the correct maximum sum is 7).

The program does not correctly maximize the sum and does not correctly describe the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
