### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly maximizes the sum of all the numbers in the matrix and adheres to the constraints.

#### Program Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `n` to calculate the maximum possible sum. The logic here seems incorrect as it does not correctly compute the maximum sum for the matrix. The maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix where each row and column can be filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n` is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`. This is because each row and column can be filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], and there are `n` rows and `n` columns.
   - The logic provided in the code does not compute this correctly. Instead, it seems to be attempting to compute some intermediate sum based on a condition that doesn't align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Printing the Sum and Number of Operations:**
   - The program prints the calculated sum and the number of operations, which is `n + r`. The value of `r` is determined within the loop and doesn't seem to be correctly calculated to maximize the sum.
   - The number of operations should be `2n` as per the problem statement, but the current logic does not guarantee this.

4. **Printing Operations:**
   - The program prints the operations to fill the matrix. For the first `n` operations, it prints Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].
   - For the remaining operations, it prints Type 2 operations, but the logic here is flawed. It attempts to use a modulo operation to determine the column, but this doesn't correctly fill the matrix to achieve the maximum sum.

#### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly compute the maximum sum for the matrix and does not correctly generate the operations to achieve this sum. The logic for calculating the sum and generating operations is flawed, and the number of operations does not necessarily meet the problem's constraints.

### Correctness: **False**
