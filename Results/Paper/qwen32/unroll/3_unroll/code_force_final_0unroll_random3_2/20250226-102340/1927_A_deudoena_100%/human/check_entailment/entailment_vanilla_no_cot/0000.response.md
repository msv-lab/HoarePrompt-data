Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum segment length to paint all cells white, but it does so incorrectly. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only considers the first and last black cell in the string and calculates the distance between them plus two, which does not necessarily give the minimum segment length that needs to be painted to make all cells white.

The correct approach involves finding the longest sequence of consecutive black cells ('B') in the string, as this sequence represents the minimum segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. The given program does not implement this logic.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_black_streak = 0
    current_black_streak = 0
    
    for j in s:
        if j == 'B':
            current_black_streak += 1
            if current_black_streak > max_black_streak:
                max_black_streak = current_black_streak
        else:
            current_black_streak = 0
            
    return max_black_streak
```

This function correctly finds the longest streak of black cells and returns that as the minimum segment length to be painted white.
