Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 'B' in the string s. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer.**

In this state, the variable `m` has been assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged at 0. The descriptions of the test cases and the conditions for the string `s` remain valid.
