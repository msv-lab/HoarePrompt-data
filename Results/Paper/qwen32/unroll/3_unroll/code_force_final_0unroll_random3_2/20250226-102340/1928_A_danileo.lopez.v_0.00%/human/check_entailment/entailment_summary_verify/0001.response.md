### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from a given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key observation is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can always rearrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle. Conversely, if both dimensions are odd, he cannot form a new rectangle different from the original one.

Let's break down the given program and function summary:

1. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly states that the function processes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it prints "Yes" if at least one of the integers `a` or `b` is even, otherwise it prints "No".

3. **Validation Against Problem Description**:
   - **Case 1**: If either `a` or `b` is even, the program prints "Yes".
     - This is correct because if `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of sizes `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)`, which can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a, b/2)`.
     - Similarly, if `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of sizes `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)`, which can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a/2, b)`.
   - **Case 2**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints "No".
     - This is correct because if both dimensions are odd, any cut will result in smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and rearranging these will not form a new rectangle different from the original one.

4. **Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1`, both dimensions are odd, so the output is "No".
   - For the input `2 1`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For the input `2 6`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For the input `3 2`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For the input `2 2`, both dimensions are even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For the input `2 4`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For the input `6 3`, one dimension is even, so the output is "No".

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
