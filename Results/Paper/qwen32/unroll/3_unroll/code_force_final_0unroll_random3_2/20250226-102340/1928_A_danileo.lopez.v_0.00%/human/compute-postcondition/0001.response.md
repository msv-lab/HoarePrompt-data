To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the only variable we need to consider is `t`.

The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the loop will naturally execute without any need for adjustment to `t` itself because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

However, the loop head does not include `a` and `b`, so we cannot adjust those variables to ensure the loop executes. They are mentioned in the problem description but are not part of the loop head, and thus, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop will execute, and we do not need to make any adjustments to the variables in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9**
