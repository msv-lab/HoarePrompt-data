### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original (ignoring rotations).

The key insight is:
- If either dimension \( a \) or \( b \) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, the rectangle can only be cut into smaller rectangles of size \( 1 \times \text{odd} \), which can only rearrange to form the same rectangle (considering rotations).

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
- If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
- Otherwise, it prints 'No', indicating that no other rectangle can be formed.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the test cases described in the problem statement and the execution summary aligns with the expected behavior.

**Correctness: True**
