You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Given a trace array `a` of an unknown string `s`, the goal is to reconstruct any string `s` that could have produced this trace. The trace array `a` indicates, for each character in `s`, how many times this character has appeared before it in the string `s`.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`: This is the alphabet string from which we will draw characters to construct our string `s`.
   - `b = [0] * 26`: This is a list to keep track of how many times each letter from 'a' to 'z' has been used in the current string `s` that we are constructing.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `n = int(input())`: Read the length of the string `s` for the current test case.
   - `s = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Read the trace array `a` for the current test case.
   - `r = ''`: Initialize an empty string `r` to build the result string `s`.

3. **Reconstructing the String**:
   - For each value `i` in the trace array `s`:
     - `x = b.index(i)`: Find the index `x` in `b` where the count matches `i`. This index `x` corresponds to the next character to add to `r` because `b[x]` tells us how many times the character `a[x]` has been used so far.
     - `r += a[x]`: Append the character `a[x]` to the result string `r`.
     - `b[x] += 1`: Increment the count of the character `a[x]` in `b` to reflect that it has been used one more time.

4. **Output**:
   - `print(r)`: Print the reconstructed string `r` for the current test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Finding the Correct Character**:
  - The program uses `b.index(i)` to find the character that has been used `i` times before. This works because initially, all counts in `b` are zero, and as the string is constructed, the counts are incremented correctly.
  - However, `b.index(i)` will always return the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`. If the same count appears multiple times in `b`, it will always choose the first letter in the alphabet that has that count. This ensures that the first time a particular count `i` is encountered, it will pick the first available letter that has been used `i` times, which is correct according to the problem statement.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by resetting `r` and `b` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` for each test case based on the given trace array `a`. It ensures that the trace array is respected and that the string consists of lowercase Latin letters.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
