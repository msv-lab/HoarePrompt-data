You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(input())
        
        res = [0] * n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        
        c = 1
        
        l = 0
        
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is a list `res` of length `n` where each element is the result of the computations described above, printed in a single line. The state of other variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, `c`, `l`, `r` does not need to be specified as they are not part of the output.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the provided values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
