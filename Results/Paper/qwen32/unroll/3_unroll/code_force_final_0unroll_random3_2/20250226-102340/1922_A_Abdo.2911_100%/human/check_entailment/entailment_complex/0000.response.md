### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` processes each test case by checking each character position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine if a valid template `t` can exist. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the function reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Possibility Check**:
    - The variable `possible` is initialized to `False`.
    - The function iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
    - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, it means that at this position, both `a` and `b` have the same character. For a template to match `a` and `b` while not matching `c`, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]` since they are the same). If this condition holds, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
    - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it means `a` and `b` have different characters at this position. For the template to match `a` and `b` while not matching `c`, `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the loop continues, checking the next position. If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

3. **Output**: After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it means there exists at least one template that satisfies the conditions, and the function prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The function correctly checks the conditions for each character position and determines if a template can exist that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.
- The logic ensures that if there is any position where `a` and `b` match and `c` does not, or where `a` and `b` differ and `c` is different from both, the function will correctly identify this and print "YES".

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid template exists for each test case as per the problem description.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The function `func_1` correctly checks each character position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine if a valid template can exist. It ensures that if there is any position where `a` and `b` match and `c` does not, or where `a` and `b` differ and `c` is different from both, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
Correctness: **True**
