Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three strings of equal length. For each test case, it determines if there exists at least one position where the third string differs from the first two strings, or if the third string matches at least one of the first two strings at every position. It prints 'YES' if such a condition is met for any test case, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
