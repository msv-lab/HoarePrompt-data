Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case it outputs a series of lines. For each test case, it first outputs `1 1` and `1 2`, then for each integer `i` from 3 to `n` (where `n` is the input for that test case), it outputs `i i`. The values of `t` and `n` for each test case remain unchanged.**
