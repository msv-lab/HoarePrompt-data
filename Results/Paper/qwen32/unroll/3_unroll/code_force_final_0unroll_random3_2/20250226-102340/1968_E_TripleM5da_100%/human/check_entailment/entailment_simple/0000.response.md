Reasoning: 
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all values of n. The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells. The code always outputs the points (1,1), (1,2), and then (i,i) for i from 3 to n. This strategy does not guarantee that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is achieved.

For small values of n, such as n=2 and n=3, the given code might happen to produce a set of points that yields a relatively large set of distinct Manhattan distances, but for larger values of n, the strategy is suboptimal. The arrangement of points should be such that it maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances, which is not achieved by the given code.

For example, for n=4, the code outputs the points (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), and (4,4). The distinct Manhattan distances are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which is 6 in total. However, a better arrangement could be (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), and (4,4), which produces the distinct Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, which is 8 in total.

Therefore, the given code does not correctly solve the problem for all values of n.

Correctness: **False**
