You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` of length `n`. A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
- `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`
- `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`

### Solution Analysis:
The solution provided involves reading the input, processing each test case, and counting the number of beautiful pairs in each array.

#### Key Steps in the Solution:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The entire input is read at once and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `t` is extracted.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted, followed by the array `arr` of length `n`.
   - This information is stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, a `residue_map` dictionary is initialized to keep track of pairs of residues.
   - The solution iterates through each number in the array `arr`.
   - For each number `num` in the array, it calculates:
     - `r_x = -num % x`
     - `r_y = num % y`
   - The count of beautiful pairs is incremented by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before (using `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`).
   - The current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` is added to the `residue_map` and its count is incremented.

3. **Calculating Residues:**
   - The key part of the solution is the calculation of residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that the residue is non-negative.
     - `r_y = num % y` is straightforward.
   - The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful can be rephrased in terms of residues:
     - `a[i] + a[j] ≡ 0 (mod x)` ⟹ `a[i] ≡ -a[j] (mod x)` ⟹ `a[i] % x ≡ -a[j] % x (mod x)`
     - `a[i] - a[j] ≡ 0 (mod y)` ⟹ `a[i] ≡ a[j] (mod y)` ⟹ `a[i] % y ≡ a[j] % y (mod y)`
   - Therefore, a pair `(i, j)` is beautiful if `(a[i] % x, a[i] % y)` has been seen before as `(-a[j] % x, a[j] % y)`.

### Correctness:
The solution correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs by using a dictionary to keep track of the residues seen so far. The logic for calculating residues and checking for beautiful pairs is sound. The solution efficiently processes each test case in a single pass through the array, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct based on the problem description and the constraints.

**Correctness: True**
