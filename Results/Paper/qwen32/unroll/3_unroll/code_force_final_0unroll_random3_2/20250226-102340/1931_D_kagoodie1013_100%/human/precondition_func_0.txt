test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) representing Polycarp's favorite integers, and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The total number of elements across all arrays in test_cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
