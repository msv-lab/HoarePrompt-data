### Reasoning:

The program is designed to count the number of beautiful pairs in an array for each test case. A pair of indices \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The key to solving this problem efficiently is to use a dictionary (or hashmap) to keep track of the remainders of the array elements when divided by \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, for each element \(a_i\) in the array, the program calculates:
- \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\)
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\)

The logic is based on the fact that for a pair \((i, j)\) to be beautiful:
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \mod x\), which implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \mod x\).
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \mod y\), which implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \mod y\).

Thus, for each element \(a_i\), the program checks how many previous elements in the array have the same \(r_y\) and the complementary \(r_x\) (i.e., \(-a_j \mod x\)). This is efficiently done using a dictionary `residue_map` that maps pairs \((r_x, r_y)\) to the count of elements with those remainders.

The program iterates through each element of the array, updates the count of beautiful pairs based on the current element and the previously stored remainders, and then updates the dictionary with the current element's remainders.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The use of a dictionary to store and look up remainders ensures that the solution is efficient, even for large input sizes.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
