### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array for multiple test cases. A beautiful pair \((i, j)\) is defined as one where:

1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\),
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program's approach is to use a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the number of times each pair of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen, where:
- \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\),
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\).

For each element in the array, the program calculates these residues and checks how many times the complementary residues (which would make a pair valid) have been seen before. It then updates the count of valid pairs and updates the residue map with the current element's residues.

Let's break down the correctness:

1. **Residue Calculation**:
   - \(r_x = -num \% x\): This is equivalent to finding the residue of \(-num\) modulo \(x\). In Python, the modulo operation with a negative number returns a positive result, so this is correct.
   - \(r_y = num \% y\): This is straightforward and correct.

2. **Checking for Valid Pairs**:
   - The program checks how many times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before in the map. This is correct because if a previous element had residues that would make a valid pair with the current element, it would have been counted.

3. **Updating the Map**:
   - The current element's residues are added to the map, incrementing their count. This is correct as it updates the state for future elements to reference.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program processes each element in the array once, making it efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The program is tested with multiple test cases, and the output matches the expected results, indicating that it is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It efficiently handles the constraints and produces the correct output for the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
