Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not account for all scenarios where the minimum number of invitations might be more than 2. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it does not work as expected.

The code currently checks for the condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i`, which is meant to detect if there is a cycle of length 3 (i.e., a triplet of friends where each friend is the best friend of the next in the cycle). If such a cycle is found, it prints 2 because inviting any two friends in the cycle will result in at least two friends attending the party. However, this is not the only scenario where Monocarp can invite just 2 friends.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```
In this case, the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 4. The code will not find a cycle of length 3, so it will fall back to printing 3. However, Monocarp can still invite just 2 friends (e.g., friends 1 and 2) and have both come to the party because friend 1's best friend (friend 2) is invited, and friend 2's best friend (friend 3) is not required to be invited for friend 2 to come. Similarly, friend 2's best friend (friend 3) is invited, and friend 3's best friend (friend 4) is not required to be invited for friend 3 to come. Thus, the correct answer should be 2, not 3.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly, specifically cycles of length greater than 3 where inviting just 2 friends can still result in at least 2 friends attending the party.
