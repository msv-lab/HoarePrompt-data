Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
Monocarp wants to invite at least 2 friends to a party. Each friend \( i \) has a best friend \( p_i \), and the best friend relationship is one-to-one (i.e., \( p_i \neq i \) and all \( p_i \) are distinct). A friend \( i \) will come to the party if both \( i \) and \( p_i \) receive invitations. We need to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( n \) and the list of best friends \( p \). It then determines the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Base Case for \( n = 2 \)**:
   - If there are only 2 friends, both must be invited for either to attend. Thus, the program correctly prints `2` for this scenario.

2. **Checking for Triangular Relationships**:
   - The program checks if there exists a triplet \( i \), \( v[i] \), and \( v[v[i]] \) such that \( v[v[v[i]]] = i \). If such a triplet is found, it means that inviting two friends in this cycle is sufficient to ensure at least two friends attend the party. This is because:
     - If \( v[v[v[i]]] = i \), then \( i \), \( v[i] \), and \( v[v[i]] \) form a cycle.
     - Inviting any two friends in this cycle (say \( i \) and \( v[i] \)) ensures that both \( i \) and \( v[i] \) come to the party because \( v[i] \) is the best friend of \( i \) and vice versa.
     - Thus, the program correctly prints `2` if such a cycle is found.

3. **Default Case**:
   - If no such triplet is found, the program defaults to printing `3`. This is because in the worst case, Monocarp may need to invite 3 friends to ensure at least 2 attend. This is a conservative estimate and can be true in scenarios where no such triplet exists.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the base case for \( n = 2 \) and efficiently checks for a cycle of three friends that can be invited to ensure at least two attend. If no such cycle is found, it defaults to inviting 3 friends, which is a valid, albeit not necessarily optimal, solution.

Thus, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly handles the base case for \( n = 2 \), checks for a cycle of three friends that can be invited to ensure at least two attend, and defaults to inviting 3 friends if no such cycle is found. This logic aligns with the problem requirements.
Correctness: **True**
