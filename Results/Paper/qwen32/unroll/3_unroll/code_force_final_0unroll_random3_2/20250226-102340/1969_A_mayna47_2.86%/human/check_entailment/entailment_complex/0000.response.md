### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure at least two friends attend the party. Each friend will attend if both they and their best friend receive an invitation. The program uses a function `func_1` to handle each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is as follows:
1. If `n` is 2, the program directly outputs `2` because with only two friends, Monocarp must invite both to ensure at least two friends attend.
2. For `n > 2`, the program checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such an index exists, it means there is a cycle of length 3 (i.e., `i` is best friends with `v[i]`, `v[i]` is best friends with `v[v[i]]`, and `v[v[i]]` is best friends with `i`). If such a cycle exists, Monocarp can invite just two people to ensure at least two friends attend. If no such cycle exists, Monocarp needs to invite three people to ensure at least two friends attend.

Let's analyze the given test cases:
1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `3 1 2 5 4`
   - Analysis: Here, `v[v[v[4]]] = v[v[5]] = v[4] = 4`, which means there is a cycle of length 3 involving friends 4, 5, and 3. Hence, Monocarp can invite just friends 4 and 5, and both will attend. The program outputs `2`, which is correct.
   
2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `2 3 4 1`
   - Analysis: Here, there is no cycle of length 3. Monocarp needs to invite at least three people to ensure at least two friends attend. The program outputs `3`, which is correct.
   
3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Analysis: Since `n` is 2, the program directly outputs `2`. Both friends are best friends with each other, so inviting both ensures both attend. The program outputs `2`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations needed based on the given conditions. It handles both the special case when `n` is 2 and the general case when `n` is greater than 2 by checking for cycles of length 3.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
