The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `testcases`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `testcases`.

The loop will execute if `testcases` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `testcases` holds a value that is greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` holds the value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0**
