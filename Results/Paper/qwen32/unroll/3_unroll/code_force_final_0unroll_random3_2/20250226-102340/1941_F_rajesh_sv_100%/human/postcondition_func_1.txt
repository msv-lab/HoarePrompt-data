The function returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` was not originally in `d`, it adds a new key-value pair to `d` where the key is `args` and the value is the result of `func(*args)`, and then returns this result. If `args` was already in `d`, it returns the previously stored value associated with `args`.
