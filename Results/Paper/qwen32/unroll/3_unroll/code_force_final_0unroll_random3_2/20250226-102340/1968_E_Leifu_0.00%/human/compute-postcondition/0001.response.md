The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The value of `n` does not affect whether the loop executes, so it does not need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, `i` is not initialized, so it needs to be set to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
