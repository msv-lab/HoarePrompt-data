To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given code snippet. The code consists of an outer loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the code performs the following actions:

1. It reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3).
2. It prints the pairs '1 1' and '1 2'.
3. If `n` is 3, it prints the pair '2 3'.
4. If `n` is not 3, it prints the pair '2 4' and then enters an inner loop that prints pairs from '4 4' to 'n n'.

Let's break down the output for a few values of `n` to understand the pattern:

- For `n = 2`:
  - Output: '1 1', '1 2'

- For `n = 3`:
  - Output: '1 1', '1 2', '2 3'

- For `n >= 4`:
  - Output: '1 1', '1 2', '2 4', '4 4', '5 5', ..., 'n n'

Since the code only prints pairs and does not modify any variables other than `n` within the loop body, the only state that changes is the printed output. The variables `t` and `n` are not modified in a way that affects their values outside the loop iterations.

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop will be the printed output for each test case, which is determined by the value of `n` for each test case.

Output State: **The printed output for each test case, which includes the pairs '1 1', '1 2', and additional pairs based on the value of `n` as described above.**
