Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It then prints specific pairs of numbers: '1 1', '1 2', and additional pairs based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. Otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of the form 'j j' for each `j` from 4 to `n`.**
