### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to output `n` points in an `n x n` grid that maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, denoted as \(\mathcal{H}\). The program seems to follow a specific pattern for selecting these points based on the value of `n`.

Let's break down the program's logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - For `n = 2`, the program outputs the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. The Manhattan distances between these points are `0` (distance between the same point) and `1` (distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`). This set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\) has a size of 2, which is optimal for `n = 2`.

2. **For `n = 3`:**
   - The program outputs the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`. The Manhattan distances between these points are:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `1`
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`: `3`
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)`: `2`
     - Self-distances: `0`
   - The set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) has a size of 4, which is optimal for `n = 3`.

3. **For `n >= 4`:**
   - The program outputs the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for `j` from `4` to `n`.
   - The Manhattan distances between these points include:
     - `0` (self-distances)
     - `1` (between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`)
     - `3` (between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`)
     - `2` (between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`)
     - Distances of the form `|1 - j| + |1 - j| = 2 * (j - 1)` (between `(1, 1)` and `(j, j)`)
     - Distances of the form `|1 - j| + |2 - j| = |1 - j| + |j - 2|` (between `(1, 2)` and `(j, j)`)
     - Distances of the form `|2 - j| + |4 - j|` (between `(2, 4)` and `(j, j)`)
     - Distances of the form `|j - k| + |j - k| = 2 * |j - k|` (between `(j, j)` and `(k, k)` for `j != k`)

   - The program ensures that there are enough distinct distances to maximize \(\mathcal{H}\).

However, the program does not guarantee that it will always produce the maximum possible set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`. For example, when `n = 4`, the program outputs the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(4, 4)`. The set of distinct Manhattan distances is:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `4`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `3`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `6`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: `5`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `2`
   - Self-distances: `0`
   - The set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) has a size of 7, which is optimal for `n = 4`.

The program does not correctly handle the case where `n = 4` because it outputs the point `(2, 4)` instead of a point that would maximize the set of distinct distances. The optimal points for `n = 4` should be `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(3, 1)`, and `(4, 4)` to achieve the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the maximum possible set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness:** **False**
