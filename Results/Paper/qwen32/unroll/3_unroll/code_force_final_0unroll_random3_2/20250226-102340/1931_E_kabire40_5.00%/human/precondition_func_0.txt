t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains integers n and m such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
