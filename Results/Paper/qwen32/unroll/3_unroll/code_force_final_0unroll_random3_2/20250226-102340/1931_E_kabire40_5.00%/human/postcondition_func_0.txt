The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and an integer `m`. For each test case, it constructs a new integer by reversing some of the integers in the list according to specific rules and then compares this constructed integer to `10^m`. It prints 'Sasha' if the constructed integer is greater than `10^m` and 'Anna' otherwise.
