Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= n and `p_i` is not equal to `i`. The function returns the number of fixed points in the permutation `p` for each test case. A fixed point is an index `i` such that `p_i` is equal to `i`.**
