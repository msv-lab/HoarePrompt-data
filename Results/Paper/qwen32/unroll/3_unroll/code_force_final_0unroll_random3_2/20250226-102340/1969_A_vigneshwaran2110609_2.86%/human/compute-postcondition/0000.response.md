The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. After executing this line, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user, but it will still adhere to the precondition that it is an integer between 2 and 50. The other variables `t` and `p` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i.**
