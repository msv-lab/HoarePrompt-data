To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(w):`, which means the loop will execute based on the value of `w`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute `w` times.
- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted since it is not used in the loop body.
- The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 0.

### Given State:
- `w` is an integer input (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), the number of test cases.

### Required Adjustments:
- The value of `w` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
Since `w` is already constrained to be between 1 and 100, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for `w` to ensure the loop executes.

### Final State:
State: **`w` is an integer input (1 ≤ w ≤ 100)**

This state already ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
