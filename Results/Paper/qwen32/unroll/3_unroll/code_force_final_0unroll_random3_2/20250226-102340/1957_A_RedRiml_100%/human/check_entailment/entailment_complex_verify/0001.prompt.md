You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the number of triangles that can be formed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of stick lengths, and for each test case, it calculates and prints the number of triangles that can be formed using the sticks, where each triangle requires at least three sticks of the same length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from given sticks, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

### Key Points
1. **Regular Polygon**: A regular polygon has all sides of equal length.
2. **Minimum Sides for a Polygon**: The minimum number of sides a polygon can have is 3 (a triangle).
3. **Constraints**: 
   - Each stick length can be used to form sides of polygons.
   - Each stick can be used only once.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - First, it reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Maximum Polygons**:
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, if the count of that stick length `d[j]` is at least 3, it calculates how many polygons can be formed using those sticks (`d[j] // 3`) and adds this to the `shapes` counter.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the total number of polygons that can be formed for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

The main issue with the program is that it incorrectly assumes that any set of 3 sticks of the same length can form a polygon. However, the program does not account for polygons with more than 3 sides. For example, if there are 6 sticks of the same length, the program will only count 2 triangles, but it could actually form 1 hexagon (a 6-sided polygon).

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) that can be formed with the given sticks. For each unique stick length, we should determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of that stick length by the sides of the polygon, starting from triangles (3 sides) and going up.

### Conclusion

The current implementation is incorrect because it only considers forming triangles and does not account for polygons with more than 3 sides.

### Correctness

Correctness: **False**
