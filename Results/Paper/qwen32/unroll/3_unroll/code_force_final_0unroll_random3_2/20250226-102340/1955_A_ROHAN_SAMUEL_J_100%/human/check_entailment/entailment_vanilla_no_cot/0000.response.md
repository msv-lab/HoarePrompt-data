To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze if it correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the provided prices `a` and `b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic the program should follow:

1. **Determine if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price**:
   - If `b < 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
   - If `b >= 2 * a`, it is cheaper or equally expensive to buy two yogurts at the regular price.

2. **Calculate the minimum cost**:
   - If `n` is even, the minimum cost is `(n // 2) * b` if `b < 2 * a`, otherwise it is `n * a`.
   - If `n` is odd, the minimum cost is `((n - 1) // 2) * b + a` if `b < 2 * a`, otherwise it is `n * a`.

Let's verify the program against this logic:

- If `n % 2` is `True` (i.e., `n` is odd):
  - The program checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it prints `a * n`.
  - If false, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`.
  
- If `n % 2` is `False` (i.e., `n` is even):
  - The program checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it prints `a * n`.
  - If false, it prints `n // 2 * b`.

The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd and `b < 2 * a` correctly. When `n` is odd, the correct formula is `((n - 1) // 2) * b + a`, but the program incorrectly uses `n // 2 * b + a` instead. This leads to an incorrect calculation in some scenarios.

Let's correct the logic for the odd case:

- For odd `n`, the number of pairs of yogurts is `(n - 1) // 2`, and one yogurt is bought individually.

Thus, the correct program should be:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print((n // 2) * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

The given program does not handle the case correctly, so the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
