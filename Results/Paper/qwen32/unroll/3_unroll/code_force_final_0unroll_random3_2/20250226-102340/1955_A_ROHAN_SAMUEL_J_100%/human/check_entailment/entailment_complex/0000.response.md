Reasoning:  
The program correctly determines the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Odd `n` Handling**: If `n` is odd (`n % 2` is true), the program checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`2 * a`). If `2 * a` is cheaper, it prints `a * n` (the cost of buying all yogurts individually). Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a` (the cost of buying `n - 1` yogurts in pairs and one yogurt individually).
3. **Even `n` Handling**: If `n` is even (`n % 2` is false), the program similarly checks whether the promotion price (`b`) for two yogurts is cheaper than buying them individually (`2 * a`). If `2 * a` is cheaper, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b` (the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs).

This logic ensures that the program always calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices.

Correctness: **True**
