### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem described, but there are several issues with the code that prevent it from functioning correctly. Here are the key points:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Argument**: The function `func_1` is called with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x` as arguments. However, the function `func_1` expects `q` to be a single integer, not a list. The variable `q` inside `func_1` is incorrectly treated as a list when `math.sqrt(q)` is called, which will raise a `TypeError`.

2. **Logic Error in Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, the current implementation includes `w // 1` which is unnecessary since `w` is already an integer (result of `math.sqrt(q)`). Additionally, the range for the loop should start from 1 up to `int(w) + 1` to ensure all divisors are considered.

3. **Handling of Divisors**: The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where `i` and `q // i` are the same (i.e., when `q` is a perfect square). This should be handled to avoid adding the same divisor twice.

4. **Logic for Counting Valid `k` Values**: The logic for counting valid `k` values based on the conditions `n >= 3 * x - 2` and the merging of results from `func_1` is correct in theory, but the incorrect implementation of `func_1` will prevent it from working as intended.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: The program should handle edge cases and constraints correctly, but due to the above issues, it will not produce the correct results.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct and will not produce the expected results for the given problem. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
