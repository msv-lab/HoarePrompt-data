### Reasoning:

The provided code has several issues that need to be addressed to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with arguments `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. However, the function `func_1` is defined to take a single argument `q`, which is expected to be a number, not a list of tuples. The function is incorrectly called with a number instead of the intended list `q`.

2. **Incorrect Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of a number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The logic for finding divisors is correct, but the way `q` is being handled is incorrect.

3. **Handling the Input**:
   - The input handling is correct. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`.

4. **Logic for Determining `k`**:
   - The logic to determine the possible values of `k` is partially correct. The program checks if `y % 2 != 0` and if `n >= 3 * x - 2` to add more potential values of `k`. However, the function `func_1` is not being used correctly, and the logic to derive `k` from the divisors needs to be fixed.

5. **State of the Program**:
   - The state of the program before the function call is incorrect due to the wrong argument being passed to `func_1`.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, particularly the incorrect handling of the function `func_1`, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be corrected to properly call `func_1` with the correct argument and ensure that the logic for determining `k` is correctly implemented.
