Let's analyze the program and determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated states.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice starts and picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy:
- To maximize the MEX, Alice should aim to ensure that the smallest possible integers are included in `c` as long as possible.
- To minimize the MEX, Bob should aim to prevent the inclusion of the smallest possible integers in `c`.
- The optimal strategy involves understanding the frequency of each integer in the array and how it affects the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
2. **Determine MEX**:
   - The program iterates over the range `[0, N]` (where `N` is the length of `a`).
   - It checks for the first integer `i` such that either:
     - At least two integers in `a` appear exactly once (`t >= 2`), or
     - `i` does not appear in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`).

### Correctness of the Program:
- **Key Insight**: The program essentially determines the MEX by finding the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once (and there are at least two such integers).
- **Justification**:
  - If `cnt[i] == 0`, then `i` is the smallest integer not in `a`, which is the MEX.
  - If `t >= 2`, it means there are at least two integers that appear exactly once. Since Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice will pick one of these integers on her turn, and Bob will pick the other, ensuring that these two integers are included in `c`. The next smallest integer not in `c` (which is `i`) will be the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

**Correctness: True**
