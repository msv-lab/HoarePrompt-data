Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game and determine the final score. Here's why:

The program seems to be attempting to calculate the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed, and it does not consider the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Optimal Moves**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The program does not simulate the optimal moves of both players. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the initial counts of each number in the array. This approach does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during the game.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The program attempts to calculate this by iterating through numbers from 0 to `N` and checking their counts. However, this is not sufficient to determine the MEX after the game ends because the final array `c` depends on the sequence of moves made by Alice and Bob.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when all elements in the array are the same, the MEX should be 1 (since 0 will be in the final array `c`), but the program might return 0 in such cases.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
0 0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice can pick `0`, making `c = [0]` and `a = [0, 0]`.
- Bob picks `0`, making `a = [0]`.
- Alice picks `0`, making `c = [0, 0]` and `a = []`.
- The final array `c` is `[0, 0]`, and its MEX is `1`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
0
```

The program incorrectly returns `0` because it does not simulate the game and directly computes the MEX based on the initial counts, which is not the correct approach.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
