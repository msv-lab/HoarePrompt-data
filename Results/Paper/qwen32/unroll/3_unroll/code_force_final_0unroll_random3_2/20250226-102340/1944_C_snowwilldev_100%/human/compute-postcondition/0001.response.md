The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `N` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.**
