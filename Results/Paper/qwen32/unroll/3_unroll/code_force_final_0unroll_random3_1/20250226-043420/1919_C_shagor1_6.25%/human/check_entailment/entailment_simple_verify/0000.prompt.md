You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of size n . You will do the following process to
calculate your penalty:

  1. Split array a into two (possibly empty) subsequences^\dagger s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t^\ddagger . 
  2. For an array b of size m , define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1} . 
  3. The total penalty you will receive is p(s) + p(t) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained
from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

^\ddagger Some valid ways to split array a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (s,t) are
([3,4,1,5],[1]) , ([1,1],[3,4,5]) and ([\,],[3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,4,5],[1]) , ([3,1,4,1],[1,5]) and ([1,3,4],[5,1]) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\le n\le 2\cdot
10^5 ) — the size of the array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

    1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    3
    1
    0
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] .
The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 .

In the second test case, a possible way to split a is s=[8,3,1] and
t=[2,1,7,4,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1 .

In the third test case, a possible way to split a is s=[\,] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]
. The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Initialization of `x` and `y`:**
   ```python
   x = y = n + 1
   ```
   This is fine as it initializes `x` and `y` to a value greater than any element in the array.

2. **Logic inside the loop:**
   ```python
   for a in inp:
       if a <= x:
           x = a
       elif a <= y:
           y = a
       else:
           x == y
           y = a
           ans += 1
   ```
   - The first two conditions (`if a <= x:` and `elif a <= y:`) correctly update `x` and `y` if the current element `a` is less than or equal to `x` or `y` respectively.
   - However, the `else` block has a logical error:
     ```python
     x == y
     y = a
     ans += 1
     ```
     - The line `x == y` is a comparison and does nothing to update `x` or `y`.
     - The intention seems to be to update `x` to `y` and then update `y` to `a`, but this is not done correctly. The correct logic should be:
       ```python
       else:
           x = y
           y = a
           ans += 1
       ```

3. **Handling edge cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where all elements in the array are the same or where the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, these cases should still be handled correctly with the corrected logic.

4. **Example to demonstrate incorrectness:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
     - The correct output should be `3` (as per the problem description).
     - With the current code, the output would be incorrect because the logic to update `x` and `y` is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
