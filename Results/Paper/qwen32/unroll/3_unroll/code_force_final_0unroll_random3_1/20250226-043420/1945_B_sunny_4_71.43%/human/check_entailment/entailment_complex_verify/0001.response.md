### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a fundamental flaw in the provided program. Let's break down the issues and verify the logic step-by-step:

1. **Calculation of A and B:**
   - The program calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1`. This represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility duration `m` plus one. This calculation is correct in the sense that it counts the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that could be visible within the first `m` minutes.
   - Similarly, `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`. This represents the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility duration `m` plus one. This calculation is also correct for counting the fireworks launched by the second installation within the first `m` minutes.

2. **Issue with Overlap:**
   - The critical issue is that the program does not account for the overlap in visibility times between fireworks from the two installations. If fireworks from both installations are launched within `m` minutes of each other, they will be visible simultaneously. The provided program simply adds `A` and `B`, which does not consider these overlaps.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - Then, we need to calculate the number of fireworks visible at each period, taking into account the visibility duration `m`. This involves checking all possible launch times within the LCM period and counting the overlapping visibility times.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly account for the overlap in visibility times between fireworks from the two installations. Therefore, the program logic is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
