The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect any other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within a certain range, and there are multiple test cases, each with its own `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Since the code snippet only initializes the `results` list, the values of `t`, `n`, and the integers `a_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list.**
