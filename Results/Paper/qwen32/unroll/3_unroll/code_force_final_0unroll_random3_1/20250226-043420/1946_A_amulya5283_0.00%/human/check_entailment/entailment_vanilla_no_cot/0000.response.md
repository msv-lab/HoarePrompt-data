Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The program calculates the median as the middle element of the sorted array, which is correct for odd-length arrays. However, for even-length arrays, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but in this problem, we need to consider the larger of the two middle elements as the median.

2. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a heap to find the smallest element among the elements that are candidates for the median. However, the logic does not correctly handle the case when the array length is even, and it does not correctly account for the need to increase the median to be strictly greater than the current median.

3. **Logic for Increasing Median**: The program only increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. However, it does not consider the possibility of increasing other elements to achieve the minimum number of operations. For example, in the case of an even-length array, it might be more efficient to increase one of the two middle elements rather than the smallest element.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Correctly identify the median for both odd and even-length arrays.
- Use a more strategic approach to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, possibly by considering the smallest elements that need to be increased to make the median strictly greater than its current value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        (n, arr) = test_cases[i]
        arr.sort()
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        if n % 2 == 0:
            current_median = arr[median_index + 1]
        heap = arr[:median_index + 1]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        operations = 0
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        results.append(operations)
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        test_cases.append((n, arr))
        index += 1 + n
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This version correctly identifies the median and uses a heap to efficiently determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. However, it still might need further refinement to handle all edge cases optimally.
