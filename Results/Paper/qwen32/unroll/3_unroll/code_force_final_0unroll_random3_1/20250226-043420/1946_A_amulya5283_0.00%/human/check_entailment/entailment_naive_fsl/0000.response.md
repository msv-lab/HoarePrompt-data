Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array in all cases. Specifically, the code only considers the elements from the median index to the end of the array when determining the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median. However, to correctly increase the median, we need to consider the entire array and ensure that the new median is greater than the current median.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The current median of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3` (since it is the element at index `ceil(5/2) = 3` in the sorted array). To increase the median, we need to make sure that the new median is greater than `3`. The correct approach would involve increasing the appropriate elements to ensure that the new median is greater than `3`.

The provided code, however, will only consider the elements from the median index to the end of the array, which in this case are `[3, 4, 5]`. It will push the smallest element in this sublist to the heap and increment it until it is greater than the current median, which is `3`. In this case, no operations are needed according to the code, but we can increase the median by performing just one operation (e.g., increasing the element `3` to `4`).

Thus, the code is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly. It only considers a subset of the array and does not guarantee that the new median will be greater than the current median in all scenarios.
