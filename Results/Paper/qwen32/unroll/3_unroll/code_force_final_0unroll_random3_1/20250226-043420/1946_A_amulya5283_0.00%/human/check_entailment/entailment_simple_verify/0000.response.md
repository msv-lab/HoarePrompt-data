Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array by at least one unit. The median is the middle element in the sorted array, and if the array length is even, it's the element at the higher middle index.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code sorts the array and then focuses on the elements from the median index to the end of the array. It uses a min-heap to repeatedly increment the smallest element from this subarray until the smallest element is greater than the current median.

### Detailed Evaluation
1. **Sorting and Median Calculation**:
   - The array is sorted.
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for both odd and even `n` since Python's integer division floors the result, and the problem specifies the median as the higher middle element for even `n`.

2. **Heap Operations**:
   - The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the array.
   - The code repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element is greater than the current median.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The code correctly identifies the median and the elements that need to be increased to raise the median.
   - By focusing on the elements from the median index to the end, the code ensures that the new median will be greater than the current median. This is because the median in the sorted array is the element at the `median_index`, and increasing elements from this index upwards will shift the median upwards.

### Counterexample Analysis
Let's revisit the counterexample provided in the original assessment:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The median is `3` (at index `2`).
- The code initializes the heap with `[3, 4, 5]`.
- The smallest element in the heap is `3`, which is equal to the current median. The code increments it to `4` and pushes it back into the heap.
- The heap now contains `[4, 4, 5]`.
- The smallest element in the heap is `4`, which is greater than the current median `3`.
- The code correctly identifies that one operation is needed to increase the median.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly computes the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array in all cases. The original assessment is incorrect because it incorrectly claims that the code only considers a subset of the array and does not guarantee that the new median will be greater than the current median. The code actually ensures that the new median will be greater by focusing on the elements from the median index to the end.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
