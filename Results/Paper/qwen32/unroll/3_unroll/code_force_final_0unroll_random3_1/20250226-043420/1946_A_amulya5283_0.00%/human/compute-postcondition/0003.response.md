To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the code:

The given code snippet processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. It sorts the array `arr` and finds the median.
2. It initializes a heap with the second half of the sorted array (including the median if `n` is odd).
3. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap, until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the median.
4. It counts the number of such operations and appends this count to the `results` list.

Given the initial state, the `results` list is initially empty. After processing all `t` test cases, the `results` list will contain `t` integers, each representing the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.

Since the state of `t` and the `test_cases` list does not change during the execution of the loop, and the only variable that gets modified and appended to is the `results` list, the output state will only describe the `results` list after all iterations.

Output State: **results is a list containing t integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.**
