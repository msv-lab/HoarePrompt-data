You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: results is a list containing t integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' containing t integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list named `results` containing `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' containing t integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
