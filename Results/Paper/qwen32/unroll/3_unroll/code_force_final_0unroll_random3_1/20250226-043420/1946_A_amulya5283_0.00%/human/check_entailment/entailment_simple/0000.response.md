### Reasoning:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The program first sorts the array to determine the current median. This is essential because the median is defined based on the sorted order of the array.
2. **Median Calculation**: The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for both even and odd-length arrays since the problem statement specifies the median as the element at position `ceil(n/2)`, which corresponds to `n // 2` in zero-based indexing.
3. **Heap Initialization**: The program initializes a heap with the second half of the sorted array, starting from the median index. This is done to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements that need to be increased to raise the median.
4. **Heap Operations**: The program repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. This ensures that the median is increased by the minimum number of operations.
5. **Counting Operations**: The number of operations required to achieve this is counted and stored for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Median Calculation**: The median is correctly identified and the operations are performed to increase it.
- **Efficiency**: Using a heap allows the program to efficiently find and update the smallest elements in the second half of the sorted array, which is crucial given the constraints.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as arrays with a single element and arrays where all elements are the same.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case. The logic is sound and the implementation is efficient.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly sorts the array, identifies the median, uses a heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements in the second half of the array until the median is increased, and counts the number of operations required.
Correctness: **True**
