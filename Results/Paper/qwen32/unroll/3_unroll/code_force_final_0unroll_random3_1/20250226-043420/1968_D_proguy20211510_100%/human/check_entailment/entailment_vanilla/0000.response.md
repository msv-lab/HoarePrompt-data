Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the permutation), `k` (number of turns), `pb` (Bodya's starting position), and `ps` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - For both players, the program calculates the path they will follow based on the permutation `p`.
   - It uses a list `vis` to track visited positions to detect cycles.
   - For each player, it appends the value of `a` at their current position to their respective path list (`pathb` for Bodya and `paths` for Sasha) and updates their position according to the permutation `p`.
   - The loop breaks when a position is visited again, indicating a cycle.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - For both players, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve in `k` turns.
   - It iterates through their respective path lists, calculating the score for staying at the current position for the remaining turns.
   - The score is calculated as the sum of the scores from previous positions plus the current position's score multiplied by the remaining turns.
   - It keeps track of the maximum score for each player.

4. **Determine Winner**:
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input parsing and the cycle detection for both players.
- The score calculation logic appears to be correct, considering the remaining turns and the scores from the path.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases, such as cycles and the maximum number of turns.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input parsing, cycle detection, score calculation, and winner determination accurately.

**Correctness: True**
