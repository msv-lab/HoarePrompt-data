The provided code snippet only initializes two string variables `YES` and `NO` with the values `'YES'` and `'NO'`, respectively. No other variables are modified, and no other operations are performed that would affect the initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n; `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'.**
