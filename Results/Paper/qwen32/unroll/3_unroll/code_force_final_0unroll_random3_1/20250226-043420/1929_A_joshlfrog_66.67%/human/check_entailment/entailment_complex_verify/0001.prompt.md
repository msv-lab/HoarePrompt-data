You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

    2 1 3

    3 4 3 3

    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `a` remains unchanged. For each of the `t` iterations, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the input list `nums` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The input integers and their counts remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is intended to determine the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. According to the problem statement, the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the optimal arrangement is to sort the array in either ascending or descending order. However, the program provided does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and computes their difference (x - y). This approach does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array.

For example, consider the test case with the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. The correct maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array in ascending order [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] or descending order [100, 90, 80, 54, 43], both of which yield a beauty of 57. However, the program will output 100 - 43 = 57, which happens to be correct for this specific case but is not the intended logic. The program's logic would fail for other cases where the maximum beauty is not simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

Therefore, while the program might produce the correct answer for some specific cases, it does not follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.
