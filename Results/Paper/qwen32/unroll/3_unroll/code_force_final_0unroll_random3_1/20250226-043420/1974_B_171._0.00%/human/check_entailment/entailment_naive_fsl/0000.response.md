Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which attempts to map characters from the encoded string to the original characters based on the incorrect assumption that the mapping can be determined by assigning the first unused character in the alphabet to each new character encountered in the encoded string. This approach does not consider the requirement to use the symmetric character from the string `r` (which consists of all distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order).

Here is an example to illustrate why the code is incorrect:

**Example:**

Encoded string: `serofedsoc`

According to the problem description, the decoding process should be as follows:
1. Identify the distinct characters in the encoded string and arrange them in alphabetical order to form `r`: `cdefors`.
2. Replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from `r`:
   - `s` -> `c`
   - `e` -> `o`
   - `r` -> `d`
   - `o` -> `e`
   - `f` -> `r`
   - `e` -> `o`
   - `d` -> `f`
   - `s` -> `c`
   - `o` -> `e`
   - `c` -> `s`

Thus, the decoded string should be `codeforces`.

However, the provided code will not produce this result. Instead, it will assign the first unused character from the alphabet to each new character in the encoded string, leading to an incorrect mapping.

For instance, the code will map:
- `s` to `a`
- `e` to `b`
- `r` to `c`
- `o` to `d`
- `f` to `e`
- `d` to `f`
- `c` to `g`

And so on, which results in an incorrect decoded string.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for this and other potential cases.
