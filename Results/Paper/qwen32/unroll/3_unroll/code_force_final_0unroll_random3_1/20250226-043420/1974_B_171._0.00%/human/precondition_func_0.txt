The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the input is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string b, followed by the string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
