To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the `encoded` string. The loop will execute if `encoded` is not empty. Given that `encoded` is the string `b` provided in the input, we need to make sure `b` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Here are the states we need to adjust:
1. `encoded` should be the string `b` and it must not be empty.
2. `mapping` is an empty dictionary, which is fine as it doesn't affect the execution of the loop.
3. `decoded` is an empty list, which is also fine as it doesn't affect the execution of the loop.

Since the input guarantees that `n` (the length of `b`) is between 1 and 2 â‹… 10^5, `b` will never be empty. Therefore, we don't need to make any additional adjustments to `n`.

State: **`encoded` is the string `b` which is not empty, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list**
