You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are reset for each test case, `rep` is 0, `number` is undefined, `tab` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. It determines whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins, and for each test case, it outputs "YES" along with the number of transactions and the details of each transaction if possible, or "NO" if it is not possible to buy exactly `k` jewels.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The core of the problem is to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a specific price per jewel, such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next stall, and so on.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (the number of jewels Alice should buy).
3. It initializes an empty list `tab` to store the prices of the stalls.
4. It enters a loop that continues as long as Alice has coins left (`n != 0`), Alice still needs to buy more jewels (`k > 0`), there are fewer than 60 stalls (`rep < 60`), and Alice has enough coins to buy at least one jewel from the next stall (`n >= k`).
5. Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` values based on the current number of coins and jewels.
6. Depending on the conditions, it appends a price to `tab`, updates `n` and `k`, and increments the stall count `rep`.
7. After the loop, if `k` is 0 (meaning Alice bought exactly `k` jewels), it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Calculating Prices**: The logic for calculating `Min` and `Max` and deciding which one to use seems flawed. The program does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices. Instead of a greedy approach that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, it seems to try to buy as many jewels as possible with the remaining coins, which may not lead to exactly `k` jewels being bought.
2. **Termination Conditions**: The loop termination conditions are not sufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The program could exit the loop with `k` not equal to 0, meaning Alice did not buy the required number of jewels.
3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `k` is very large compared to `n` or when `n` is very large compared to `k`.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for setting up the stalls and prices is flawed, and the program does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
