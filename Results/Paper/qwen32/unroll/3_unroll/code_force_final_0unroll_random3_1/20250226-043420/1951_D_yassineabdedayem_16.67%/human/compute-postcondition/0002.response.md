To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing for all test cases, we need to understand the behavior of the provided code.

The code processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy). For each test case, it enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, the number of repetitions (`rep`) is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Within the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` based on the division of `n` by `k`, and then adjusts `number`, `k`, and `n` based on specific conditions. It appends `number` to a list `tab` and decrements `n` by `Min * Max` each time.

The loop terminates under certain conditions, and the code then checks if `k` is zero. If `k` is zero, it prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the contents of `tab`. If `k` is not zero, it prints 'NO'.

Given the nature of the loop and the conditions under which it operates, the output state after all test cases are processed will depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case. However, we can describe the final state of the variables in a general sense:

- `t`: This variable is the number of test cases and will not be modified within the loop. It will retain its initial value.
- `n` and `k`: These variables are re-initialized for each test case and will not retain their values after the loop for that test case.
- `rep`: This variable keeps track of the number of repetitions for each test case and will be reset to 0 for each new test case.
- `number`: This variable is used within the loop to store intermediate results and will not retain its value after the loop for that test case.
- `tab`: This list is used to store the sequence of numbers for each test case and will be reset to an empty list for each new test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and resets the necessary variables for each test case, the final output state will be based on the results of each test case being processed, but the variables themselves will be in their initial state for the next test case.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are reset for each test case, `rep` is 0, `number` is undefined, `tab` is an empty list.**
