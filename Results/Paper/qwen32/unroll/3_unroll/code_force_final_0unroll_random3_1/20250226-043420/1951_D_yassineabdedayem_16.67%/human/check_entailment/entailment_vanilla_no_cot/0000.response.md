Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some key issues:

1. **Logic for Price Determination**: The logic used to determine the prices (`Min`, `Max`) and how many jewels Alice buys at each stall is incorrect. The program does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in total.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints properly. For example, it doesn't ensure that the sum of the jewels bought from each stall equals `k`.

3. **Output Format**: The program doesn't format the output correctly. The prices should be printed on a single line with spaces between them, but the current implementation prints each price on a new line.

4. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions are not correctly set up to ensure that the program terminates when exactly `k` jewels have been bought or when it's determined that it's impossible to buy exactly `k` jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > n:
            print('NO')
            continue
        prices = []
        remaining_jewels = k
        remaining_coins = n
        for price in range(1, 61):
            if remaining_jewels == 0:
                break
            jewels_bought = min(remaining_jewels, remaining_coins // price)
            if jewels_bought == 0:
                continue
            prices.append(price)
            remaining_jewels -= jewels_bought
            remaining_coins -= jewels_bought * price
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(prices))
            print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by iteratively assigning prices to stalls and checking if the remaining jewels can be bought with the remaining coins. It also formats the output correctly.
