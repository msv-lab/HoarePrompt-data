Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Range Handling**: The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment where the range `[l, r]` starts and then checks the conditions to find a pair of indices. However, the logic for determining whether a valid pair exists and which pair to choose is incorrect and does not cover all scenarios.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same. It should output `-1 -1` in such cases, but the current logic may not always do so.

3. **Index Offsets**: There are issues with how the indices are calculated and compared. The program does not correctly account for the 1-based indexing specified in the problem statement.

4. **Efficiency**: The program attempts to preprocess the array into segments of consecutive identical elements, but the logic for querying these segments is incorrect and inefficient for the given constraints.

To fix these issues, the program should:

- Iterate through each query and directly check the elements in the range `[l, r]` for a pair of different elements.
- Use 1-based indexing correctly by adjusting the indices when accessing the array.
- Ensure that the program correctly handles cases where all elements in the range are the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def process():
    N = int(stdin.readline())
    nums = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
    q = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        found = False
        for i in range(l - 1, r):
            for j in range(i + 1, r):
                if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                    print(i + 1, j + 1)
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print(-1, -1)

def main():
    tc = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(tc):
        process()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version directly checks each pair of indices within the range `[l, r]` for a pair of different elements, ensuring correctness and efficiency within the given constraints.
