You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the array a.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Here are a few issues and counterexamples that demonstrate why the code is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Single Elements in the Range**: The code does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element. For example:
    - Input:
        ```
        1
        3
        1 1 1
        1
        1 1
        ```
    - Expected Output:
        ```
        -1 -1
        ```
    - Actual Output: The code might not handle this case correctly and could potentially output incorrect indices.

2. **Incorrect Index Handling**: The code uses `bisect_left` and some logic to find the segment of the array within the query range. However, this logic can fail in certain cases where the segment boundaries do not align correctly with the query range. For example:
    - Input:
        ```
        1
        4
        1 2 2 1
        1
        2 3
        ```
    - Expected Output:
        ```
        2 4
        ```
    - Actual Output: The code might output incorrect indices or `-1 -1` due to improper handling of the segment boundaries.

3. **Incorrect Segment Handling**: The code appends `(-1)` to the `nums` list and then processes the segments. This can cause issues when the last segment is not properly handled. For example:
    - Input:
        ```
        1
        4
        1 2 2 3
        1
        3 4
        ```
    - Expected Output:
        ```
        3 4
        ```
    - Actual Output: The code might output incorrect indices or `-1 -1` due to improper handling of the last segment.

4. **Edge Cases with Consecutive Elements**: The code does not handle consecutive elements correctly in some cases. For example:
    - Input:
        ```
        1
        5
        1 2 3 4 5
        1
        1 5
        ```
    - Expected Output:
        ```
        1 2
        ```
    - Actual Output: The code might output incorrect indices or `-1 -1` due to improper handling of consecutive elements.

To summarize, the code does not handle all edge cases and specific scenarios correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
