The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `arr`. None of the other variables (`N`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is the integer input representing the length of the array `a`; `q` and the query boundaries `l` and `r` remain unchanged; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**
