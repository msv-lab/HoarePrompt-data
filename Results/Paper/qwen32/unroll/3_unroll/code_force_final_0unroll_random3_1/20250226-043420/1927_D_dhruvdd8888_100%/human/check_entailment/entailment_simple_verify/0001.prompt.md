You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the program and see if it correctly addresses the problem requirements.

### Problem Understanding:
For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we should return `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes each test case by first reading the array and then processing each query. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array elements `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Compressing the Array:**
   - The program uses a list `arr` to store segments of the array where all elements are the same. Each segment is represented as a tuple `(start, end, value)`.
   - The program iterates through the array and identifies these segments. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, the segments would be `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 3, 2), (4, 5, 1)]`.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The program then checks if there is a valid pair of indices within the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition `a[i] != a[j]`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Segment Handling:**
   - The program incorrectly handles segments and does not correctly identify if a valid pair exists within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The conditions for printing `-1 -1` are not correctly defined. For example, if a segment starts after `l` and ends before `r`, it should not necessarily print `-1 -1`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the range `[l, r]` contains only one segment correctly.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the segment ends exactly at `r`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly handle all cases and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly identify valid pairs of indices for all queries and may incorrectly return `-1 -1` in scenarios where a valid pair exists.
