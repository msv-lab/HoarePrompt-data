To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the logic of the nested loops and how the variables `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `results` are updated.

1. The outer loop iterates over each integer `x` in the `test_cases` list.
2. For each `x`, the inner loop starts from `y = x - 1` and decrements `y` until `y = 1`.
3. For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`, adds `y` to the GCD, and checks if this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`.
4. If the sum is greater, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current `y`, but then immediately breaks out of the inner loop.
5. Due to the `break` statement, the inner loop will only run once per `x`, and `best_y` will always be set to `x - 1` because the first `y` checked is `x - 1`, and the loop breaks immediately after this check.

Thus, for each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` will be `x - 1`, and this value will be appended to the `results` list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000
- `results` is an empty list

After the loop executes:
- `results` will be a list containing `x - 1` for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`results` is a list where each element is `x - 1` for each `x` in `test_cases`.**
