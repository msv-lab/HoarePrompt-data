Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. For each test case, it checks if at least one of the dimensions is even and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each case based on the evenness of the dimensions.**
