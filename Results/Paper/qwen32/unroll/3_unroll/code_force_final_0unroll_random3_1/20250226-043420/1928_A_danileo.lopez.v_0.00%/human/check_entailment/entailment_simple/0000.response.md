### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle different from the original one by cutting the given rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key insight here is that for Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle must be even. 

Here's why:

- If both dimensions are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into two smaller rectangles with one dimension being 1 (since we can only cut parallel to one of the sides). For example, if the original rectangle is 3x5, cutting it would result in two 3x1 rectangles, which can only form a 3x2 or 2x3 rectangle, which is essentially the same as 3x2. Thus, no new rectangle different from the original can be formed.

- If at least one dimension is even, then we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. For example, a 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x3 rectangle.

The provided program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints "Yes", indicating that a new rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described above. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
