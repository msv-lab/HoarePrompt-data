The code snippet provided only reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. It does not affect the values of `a` and `b` or the number of test cases `t` directly, except for assigning the input value to `t`.

Output State: **Each test case consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. There are `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases, where `t` is an input integer.**
