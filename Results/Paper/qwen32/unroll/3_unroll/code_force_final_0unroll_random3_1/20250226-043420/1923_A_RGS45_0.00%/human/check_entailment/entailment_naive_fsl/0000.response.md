Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Here is why:

1. The program reads the input for the number of test cases and the details of each test case, but it does not correctly handle the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to group all chips together.

2. The program attempts to find the first occurrence of '1' and the last occurrence of '1' in the string representation of the array. However, it then slices the array from the first '1' to the last '1' and counts the number of '0's in that slice. This count does not correctly represent the minimum number of moves required.

3. The logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to move chips to form a contiguous block. For example, consider the following test case:

    ```
    5
    1 0 1 0 1
    ```

    The correct answer is 2, as you can move the chip at position 3 to position 2, and then the chip at position 5 to position 3. However, the provided program would output 3, which is incorrect.

4. Another example:

    ```
    9
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
    ```

    The correct answer is 3, but the program would output 4. It fails to account for the optimal sequence of moves.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to calculate the minimum number of moves by considering the optimal way to group all chips together, which involves moving chips to the leftmost possible positions in a way that minimizes the total number of moves. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly.
