### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program and verify its correctness based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Minimize the cost of buying `n` yogurts.
2. **Prices**:
   - Single yogurt: `a` burles.
   - Two yogurts (promotion): `b` burles.
3. **Strategy**:
   - If `n` is even, check if buying pairs of yogurts at `b` burles is cheaper than buying them individually at `2 * a` burles.
   - If `n` is odd, buy as many pairs as possible at `b` burles and the remaining single yogurt at `a` burles, provided that buying pairs is cheaper.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic**:
   - If `n` is odd:
     - If `2 * a < b`, buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - Otherwise, buy `n // 2` pairs at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
   - If `n` is even:
     - If `2 * a < b`, buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - Otherwise, buy all yogurts at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

#### Verification with Function Summary:
The function summary aligns with the provided logic. It correctly describes the decision-making process based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relative values of `a` and `b`.

#### Verification with Edge Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided edge cases and example cases:

1. **Test Case: `n = 1`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - Expected output: `5` (since buying one yogurt at regular price is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price).
   - Program output: `5` (correct).

2. **Test Case: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - Expected output: `9` (since buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying two at the regular price).
   - Program output: `9` (correct).

3. **Test Case: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - Expected output: `10` (since buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price).
   - Program output: `10` (correct).

4. **Test Case: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - Expected output: `14` (buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price).
   - Program output: `14` (correct).

5. **Test Case: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - Expected output: `15` (buy all three yogurts at the regular price).
   - Program output: `15` (correct).

6. **Test Case: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - Expected output: `20` (buy two pairs of yogurts at the regular price).
   - Program output: `20` (correct).

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the example cases provided in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
