To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and what it prints based on the conditions provided.

Given the loop:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2:
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
    elif 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b)
```

We can break down the logic as follows:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - **If `n` is odd (`n % 2`):**
     - If `2 * a < b`, print `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, print `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - **If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`):**
     - If `2 * a < b`, print `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, print `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Output:**
   - The output for each test case is printed based on the above conditions.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the output is determined by the conditions within the loop, the output state will be a series of printed values corresponding to the results of each test case.

The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will not persist after the loop execution as they are re-assigned in each iteration. The only thing that remains after the loop is the printed output for each test case.

Given the initial state where `t` test cases are provided, the output state will be the printed results of each test case based on the provided logic.

**Output State:** **The printed results for each of the `t` test cases based on the conditions provided in the loop.**
