Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step-by-step to ensure the correctness:

### Problem Breakdown
- **Objective:** Minimize the cost of buying `n` yogurts.
- **Prices:**
  - Single yogurt: `a` burles
  - Two yogurts (promotion): `b` burles

### Program Logic
1. **Input Handling:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n` is odd:
     - If `2 * a < b`, buy all yogurts individually: `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, buy `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at `b` burles each and one yogurt individually at `a` burles: `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If `n` is even:
     - If `2 * a < b`, buy all yogurts individually: `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, buy `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at `b` burles each: `n // 2 * b`.

### Function Summary
The function summary accurately describes the logic of the program. It checks the parity of `n` and compares the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs to determine the minimum cost.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and states that the program should produce the correct output based on the given problem description and the logic implemented.

### Verification
Let's verify the logic with the given example:

#### Example Test Cases
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `n` is even.
     - `2 * a = 10`, which is greater than `b = 9`.
     - Cost = `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
     - Output: `9` (Correct).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `n` is odd.
     - `2 * a = 10`, which is greater than `b = 9`.
     - Cost = `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
     - Output: `14` (Correct).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `n` is odd.
     - `2 * a = 10`, which is less than `b = 11`.
     - Cost = `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
     - Output: `15` (Correct).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `n` is even.
     - `2 * a = 10`, which is less than `b = 11`.
     - Cost = `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
     - Output: `20` (Correct).

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b`. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
