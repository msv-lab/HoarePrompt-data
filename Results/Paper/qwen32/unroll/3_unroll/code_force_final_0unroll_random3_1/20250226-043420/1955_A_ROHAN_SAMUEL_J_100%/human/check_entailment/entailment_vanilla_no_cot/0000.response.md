Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles, and the cost of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

### Logic of the Program:
1. For each test case, the program reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. If `n` is odd (`n % 2` is True):
   - If the price of two yogurts at regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then buy all `n` yogurts at regular price.
   - Otherwise, buy `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at promotion price and the remaining one yogurt at regular price.
3. If `n` is even:
   - If the price of two yogurts at regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then buy all `n` yogurts at regular price.
   - Otherwise, buy `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at promotion price.

### Correctness Check:
The logic is correct, but the implementation can be simplified. Specifically, the condition `if 2 * a < b` is repeated in two different branches, which can be simplified to a single check before branching based on whether `n` is odd or even.

However, the logic itself is correct, and the program will produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
