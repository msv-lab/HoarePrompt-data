### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to ensure it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Program Logic Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If `n` is odd:
     - It checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it calculates the total cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - If false, it calculates the total cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price).
   - If `n` is even:
     - It checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it calculates the total cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - If false, it calculates the total cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts at the promotion price).

#### Edge Cases Verification:
1. **When `n` is 1**:
   - The program will always buy one yogurt at the regular price `a` because the condition `n % 2` is true and `n // 2 * b + a` simplifies to `a`.

2. **When `n` is 2**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it buys two yogurts at the regular price.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, it buys two yogurts at the promotion price.

3. **When `n` is greater than 2**:
   - The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price if `n` is odd.

#### Annotated Code Validation:
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations, which align with the logic described above. The program correctly handles the input and computes the minimum cost based on the conditions provided.

#### Example Verification:
The example cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program:
- For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the output is `9`.
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the output is `14`.
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the output is `15`.
- For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the output is `20`.

All these cases are consistent with the expected outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. The annotations and the reasoning provided in the original assessment are accurate and consistent with the program's behavior.

**Final: True**
