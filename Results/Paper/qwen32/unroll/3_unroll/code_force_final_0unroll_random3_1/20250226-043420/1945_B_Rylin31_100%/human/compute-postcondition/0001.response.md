The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Given the provided state before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), there is no need to adjust `t` because it is already specified to be within the valid range for the loop to execute. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted manually as it is automatically initialized by the `for` loop.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is initialized to 0 by the loop**
