To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the program's logic and verify that it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them from `a` (Bob).**
2. **Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.**
3. **The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.**

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a list `cntl` to count occurrences of each element in `a` up to `n`.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If there are no `0`s in `a` (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX is `0` (since `0` is the smallest non-negative integer).
   - If there are `0`s, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s in `a`.
   - It then iterates over the range from `1` to `n` and checks the count of each number:
     - If the count of a number is less than `2`, it decrements `c` by `1`.
     - If `c` reaches `0` or the end of the range is reached, the current number `j` is printed as the MEX.

### Verification of Logic:
- **Base Case:** If there are no `0`s, the MEX is indeed `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- **General Case:** The logic to find the MEX is based on the observation that the MEX will be the smallest number that appears less than twice in `c`. This is because Alice will try to include as many distinct numbers as possible to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent this.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where all numbers are the same, or where numbers are distributed in such a way that the MEX is influenced by the count of `0`s and the first number that appears less than twice.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The provided examples in the problem statement are consistent with the program's output.

**Reasoning:** The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element, determines the MEX based on the rules of the game, and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness:** **True**
