Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Character Set**: The problem specifies that the string should consist of uppercase Latin letters. However, the program constructs the string using the characters '1', '1', and '0', which are digits, not uppercase Latin letters.

2. **Condition for Special Characters**: The program incorrectly assumes that there must be an even number of special characters to construct a valid string. However, the problem does not impose this condition. A string can have an odd number of special characters as long as the condition of having exactly `n` special characters is met.

3. **String Length**: The program constructs a string of length `3 * (n // 2)`, which is not always the minimum possible length. It could be shorter and still meet the criteria.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AB')
        elif n == 2:
            print('YES')
            print('ABA')
        else:
            s = 'A' * (n - 1) + 'B' + 'A' * (n - 1)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

This version constructs a string of uppercase Latin letters and ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters. For `n = 1`, it uses "AB" (A is special), and for `n = 2`, it uses "ABA" (A and B are special). For `n > 2`, it constructs a string like "AAAA...ABAAAA..." where the number of 'A's on each side of 'B' is `n-1`, ensuring that 'B' and all 'A's next to 'B' are special.
