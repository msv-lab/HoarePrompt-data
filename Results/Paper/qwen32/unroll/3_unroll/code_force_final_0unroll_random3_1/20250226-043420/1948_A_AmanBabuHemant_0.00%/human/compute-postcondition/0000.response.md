The code snippet `t = int(input())` updates the value of `t` to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. After the execution of the code, `t` takes on the value provided by the user, which is still guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 50, assuming the user input adheres to the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 50.**
