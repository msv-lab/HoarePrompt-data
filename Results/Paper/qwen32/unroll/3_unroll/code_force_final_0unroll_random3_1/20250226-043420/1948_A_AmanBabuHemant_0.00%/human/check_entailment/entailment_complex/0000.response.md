### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

The task is to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Constructing the String:**
   - If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string of uppercase Latin letters where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string consisting of the pattern "110" repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each '1' is a special character (it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, the other '1'). The string is constructed to have exactly `n` special characters.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if `n` is even and the string length is less than 200. Since the string is constructed by repeating "110" `n // 2` times, the length of the string is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than 200 for `n` up to 50.

### Verification with Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 6`
  - Output: `YES` followed by `110110110` (which has 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11).
  
- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 1`
  - Output: `NO` (since 1 is odd, it's impossible to have exactly 1 special character).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 2`
  - Output: `YES` followed by `110` (which has 2 special characters at positions 1 and 3).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the given problem constraints and produces the expected output for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
