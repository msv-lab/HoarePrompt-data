Reasoning: 
The given program is intended to solve the problem as described, but there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Character Set**: The problem specifies that the string should be composed of uppercase Latin letters, but the program uses the characters '1', '1', and '0'. This does not meet the problem requirements.

2. **Special Character Definition**: The problem defines a special character as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. However, the constructed string '110' does not satisfy this requirement because the '1' characters are not special (each '1' is equal to both of its neighbors), and the '0' characters are not special either (each '0' has no neighbors that are equal to it).

3. **Handling Even `n`**: The program correctly identifies that a solution exists only if `n` is even. However, the constructed string '110' * (n // 2) does not meet the criteria for special characters as defined in the problem.

4. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the string is less than 200, which is unnecessary given the constraints of the problem (the maximum length of the string will be 150 for `n = 50`).

To correct the program, we need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly `n` characters are special. One possible solution is to use a pattern that alternates between two letters in a way that satisfies the special character condition. For example, the pattern "ABA" can be used, where 'B' is the special character.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'ABA' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version constructs a string using the pattern "ABA", which ensures that exactly `n` characters are special when `n` is even.

Given the issues in the original program, the original implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
