### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem as described, but there are some issues and misunderstandings in the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Modulo Operation Misunderstanding**:
   - The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` and applies it in several places. However, the modulo operation should only be taken with respect to `m` as per the problem statement. The `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` is unnecessary and incorrect in this context.

2. **Integer Division Issue**:
   - The program uses integer division (`//`) to update the product after removing an element. This is incorrect because the product of the remaining elements is not simply the integer division of the previous product by the removed element, especially when considering the modulo operation. The correct way to handle this is to keep track of the product modulo `m` and update it accordingly.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - The initial product is calculated correctly, but the modulo operation should be taken with respect to `m`, not `MOD`.

4. **Updating the Product**:
   - When a command is 'L', the product should be updated by removing the leftmost element. Similarly, when a command is 'R', the product should be updated by removing the rightmost element. This can be done by maintaining a running product and updating it by multiplying or dividing by the appropriate element and taking the modulo `m` at each step.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the results, but due to the issues mentioned above, the results may not be correct.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = input().strip()
        
        res = [0] * n
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        
        res[0] = ans
        
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                r -= 1
            res[k + 1] = ans
        
        print(*res)

# Call the function to process input
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Implementation:

- **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product is calculated modulo `m`.
- **Modular Multiplicative Inverse**: When removing an element, the product is updated using the modular multiplicative inverse. This is necessary because direct division is not possible in modular arithmetic. The modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `m` is a number `x` such that `(a * x) % m = 1`. This can be computed using `pow(a, m - 2, m)` if `m` is a prime number, which is the case here since `m` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 10,000.
- **Output**: The results are stored in the `res` list and printed at the end.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the misuse of the `MOD` constant and the incorrect handling of the product update. The corrected version addresses these issues.

**Correctness: False**
