You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` (length of the array) and `m` (the divisor for the remainder operation).
   - It then reads the array `arr` of `n` integers.
   - The commands string `s` of length `n` is read next.

2. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in the variable `ans`.
   - It then calculates the remainder of this product when divided by `m` and stores it in the first position of the result array `res`.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to point to the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array, respectively.
   - It iterates over the commands string `s` and processes each command one by one.
   - If the command is 'L', it divides the current product `ans` by the leftmost element of the array `arr[l]` and updates `l` to point to the next element.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides the current product `ans` by the rightmost element of the array `arr[r]` and updates `r` to point to the previous element.
   - After processing each command, it calculates the remainder of the updated product `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in the result array `res`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the program prints the result array `res` for the current test case.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Product Calculation After Removing Elements:**
  - The program incorrectly divides the product `ans` by the element to be removed. However, integer division (`//`) is not the correct operation here. When an element `x` is removed from the product, the new product should be `ans/x`. But, because of the nature of integer division, this operation can lead to incorrect results if `ans` is not perfectly divisible by `x`.
  - For example, if `ans` is 24 and `x` is 3, `ans // x` would be 8, which is correct. But if `ans` is 25 and `x` is 3, `ans // x` would be 8, which is not the correct product when 3 is removed from 25.

- **Modulo Operation Misuse:**
  - The program incorrectly applies the modulo operation `MOD` after each division. The modulo operation should only be applied to the final product before taking the remainder with `m`.

- **Initial Product Calculation:**
  - The initial product calculation is correct, but the subsequent divisions and modulo operations are not handled correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified above, the program does not correctly process the commands and calculate the required remainders. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
