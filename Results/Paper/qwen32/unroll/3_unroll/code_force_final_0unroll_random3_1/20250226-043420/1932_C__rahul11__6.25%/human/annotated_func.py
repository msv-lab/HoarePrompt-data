#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: res is a list of n integers representing the intermediate results of the product of the elements in arr after dividing out elements based on the directions in s, taken modulo m and then modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a corresponding string of directions ('L' and 'R'). For each test case, it calculates a sequence of results by iteratively dividing the product of the list of integers by elements specified by the directions, taking the result modulo `m` and then modulo a large constant `MOD`. The final output for each test case is a list of these calculated results.
