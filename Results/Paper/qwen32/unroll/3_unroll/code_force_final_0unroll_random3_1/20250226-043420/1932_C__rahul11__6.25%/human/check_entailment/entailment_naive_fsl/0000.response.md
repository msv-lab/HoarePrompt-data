Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Product and Modulo**:
   - The program calculates the initial product of the array elements and then divides it by the removed element to update the product for the next iteration. However, integer division (`//`) does not work correctly when the product is not perfectly divisible by the removed element, especially under modulo operations. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Modulo Operation Misuse**:
   - The code uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` which is unnecessary and incorrect in this context. The problem only requires taking the modulo `m` of the product, not an additional large modulo.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the product becomes zero modulo `m` early in the process. Once the product modulo `m` becomes zero, it should remain zero for all subsequent commands.

Here is an example that demonstrates the incorrect behavior:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
LRR
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 2 2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial product modulo 3: `(1 * 2 * 3) % 3 = 6 % 3 = 0`
- Process 'L': Remove 1, new product modulo 3: `(2 * 3) % 3 = 6 % 3 = 0`
- Process 'R': Remove 3, new product modulo 3: `2 % 3 = 2`
- Process 'R': Remove 2, new product modulo 3: `0` (since the product was already zero)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
- The program might output incorrect values due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all cases, so the correctness is **False**.
