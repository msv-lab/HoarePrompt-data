Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function Definitions**: The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are not used in the program, and `func_1` is incorrectly defined. It does not return a `wrapper` function because `d` is not defined in the global scope where `wrapper` is used.

2. **Logic for Finding the Minimum Imbalance**: The logic for finding the minimum imbalance is flawed. The program calculates the maximum and next maximum differences and then tries to minimize the maximum difference by inserting a new problem. However, the binary search logic to find the optimal position for the new problem is incorrect and does not guarantee the minimum imbalance.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where adding a new problem does not change the imbalance or where the new problem should be inserted at the beginning or the end of the list.

4. **Efficiency**: The program uses `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` inside a loop over `F`, which can be inefficient given the constraints. A more efficient approach would be to use a different strategy to find the optimal position for the new problem.

To correctly solve the problem, a more efficient and accurate approach is required, such as using a two-pointer technique or a more refined binary search strategy to find the optimal position for the new problem. The current implementation does not ensure the correct minimum imbalance for all test cases.
