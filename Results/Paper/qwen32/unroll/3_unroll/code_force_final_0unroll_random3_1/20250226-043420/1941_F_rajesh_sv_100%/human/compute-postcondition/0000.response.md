Output State: **testcases is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, func_3() and func_6() are functions that provide the necessary input data and perform the required computations for each test case, respectively.**

Natural Language: The variable `testcases` is updated to hold the value returned by the function `func_3()`. The functions `func_3()` and `func_6()` remain as described in the initial state, providing input data and performing computations for each test case.
