To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, we need to understand the roles and values of the variables `ans` and `next_max_diff` based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F` are mentioned but their specific values are not provided.
- `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are also mentioned but their specific values are not provided.
- `index`, `left`, `right` are mentioned but their specific values are not provided.
- `ans` is described as the minimum of the maximum differences found during the loop iterations.

### Analysis:
- `ans` is the minimum value of the maximum differences calculated during some loop iterations. This implies that `ans` holds a specific numerical value that represents the smallest maximum difference encountered.
- `next_max_diff` is a variable that presumably holds the maximum difference found in the current or most recent iteration of the loop.

### Output Determination:
The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the larger of the two values: `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Since the exact values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The output will be the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Final Output:
Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum of the maximum differences found during the loop iterations and next_max_diff is the maximum difference found in the current or most recent iteration)**
