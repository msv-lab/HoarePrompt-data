In the provided code, the for loop iterates `y` times, where `y` is determined by the integer input. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `y` in the loop head. The variable `y` is derived from the integer input, so we need to ensure that this input results in a value greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Input for `y`:** The loop will execute `y` times, where `y` is the integer read from the input. For the loop to execute at least once, `y` must be at least 1.

2. **Variables in the loop head:** The only variable in the loop head is `y`. We need to ensure that `y` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the integer input results in `y` being at least 1. Since `t` (the number of test cases) is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we can assume that the input for `y` will be provided correctly for each test case.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `y` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` must be at least 1**
