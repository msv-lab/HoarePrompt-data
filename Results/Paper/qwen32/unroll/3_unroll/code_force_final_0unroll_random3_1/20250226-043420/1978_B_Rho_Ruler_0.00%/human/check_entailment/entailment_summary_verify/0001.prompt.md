You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Function Summary: 
The function takes four integer parameters `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, with the constraints that 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. It calculates a value based on these parameters and returns True if this calculated value is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i-th` bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k`. Here are the steps in the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to `n`.
   - `ans` is initialized to -1, which will store the optimal `k`.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The program performs a binary search between `low` and `high` to find the maximum `k` that satisfies a certain condition.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current search range.
   - It then calls `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` to check if selling `mid` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price results in a valid profit condition.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - It sums the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.
   - It then checks if this total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. However, this condition does not make sense in the context of maximizing profit. The condition seems to be checking if the total profit is less than or equal to the maximum possible profit if all buns were sold at the maximum of `a` and `b`, which is not the correct approach to maximize the profit.

### Correctness

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because the condition in `func_1` is not appropriate for maximizing the profit. Instead, we need to directly calculate the profit for each possible `k` and find the `k` that gives the maximum profit.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to calculate the profit for each possible `k` and find the maximum profit. The profit for a given `k` can be calculated as follows:

- Profit from the first `k` buns: Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`, which is `k * b - (k * (k - 1)) / 2`.
- Profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `(n - k) * a`.

The total profit for a given `k` is the sum of the above two profits. We need to find the `k` that maximizes this total profit.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it uses an inappropriate condition in `func_1`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
