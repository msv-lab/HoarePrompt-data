Reasoning:  
The given program is not correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` is not actually calculating the profit for a given `k` and comparing it with other possible profits. Instead, it calculates a value that does not represent the profit and checks if this value is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition does not help in finding the maximum profit.

The correct approach should be to calculate the profit for each possible `k` and keep track of the maximum profit. Here's how it should be done:

1. For each `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)`, calculate the profit as follows:
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of the series `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1)`, which can be calculated as `k * b - (k * (k - 1)) // 2`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
2. The total profit for a given `k` is the sum of these two values.
3. Track the maximum profit across all possible values of `k`.

The current implementation does not follow this logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
