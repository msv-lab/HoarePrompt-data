You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: - The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions mentioned above.
    #   - The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are modified during each iteration of the loop, but the final output state is determined by the printed results for each test case.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing '<' and/or '>' characters. For each test case, it determines whether it's possible to match each '>' in the second string with a '<' in the first string such that each pair of matched characters are facing each other. The function outputs 'YES' if such a matching is possible for a test case and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, starting from (1, 1). The robot moves in two steps:
1. A free move (up, down, left, or right).
2. A move along the arrow in the current cell.

The grid is described by two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' (left) or '>' (right).

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through each test case and performs the following steps:

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the number of columns `n`.
     - Read the first row of arrows `a`.
     - Read the second row of arrows `b`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - If the second-to-last arrow in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not '>', the program immediately prints 'NO' because the robot cannot move to (2, n) if the second-to-last arrow in the second row does not point to the right.

3. **Special Case for n = 1:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'YES'. However, this case is invalid according to the problem constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).

4. **Path Checking:**
   - Initialize `no_path` to `True`.
   - Check all even-indexed arrows in the second row (`b[k]` for k = 0, 2, 4, ...):
     - If any of these arrows is not '>', set `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True`, reset it to `True` and check all odd-indexed arrows in the first row (`a[k]` for k = 1, 3, 5, ..., n-2):
     - If any of these arrows is not '>', set `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Special Case for n = 1:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the case when `n == 1` by printing 'YES', but this case is not possible according to the problem constraints.

2. **Logic for Path Checking:**
   - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The program checks only specific patterns of arrows without considering all possible paths the robot can take.
   - The program assumes that the robot must follow a specific sequence of moves (alternating between rows and following arrows in a particular direction) to reach the destination. This assumption is incorrect because the robot can move freely in the first step and then follow the arrow.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the first test case from the example:

```
4
4
>><<
>>><
```

- The program checks `b[-2]` which is '>', so it proceeds.
- It then checks all even-indexed arrows in `b`: `b[0]` is '>' and `b[2]` is '>', so `no_path` remains `True`.
- It then checks all odd-indexed arrows in `a`: `a[1]` is '>' and `a[3]` is '<', so `no_path` is set to `False`.
- Since `no_path` is `False`, the program prints 'NO', which is incorrect. The correct path is (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 4).

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine all possible paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

Correctness: **False**
