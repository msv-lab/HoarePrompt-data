The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing '<' and/or '>' characters. For each test case, it determines whether it's possible to match each '>' in the second string with a '<' in the first string such that each pair of matched characters are facing each other. The function outputs 'YES' if such a matching is possible for a test case and 'NO' otherwise.
