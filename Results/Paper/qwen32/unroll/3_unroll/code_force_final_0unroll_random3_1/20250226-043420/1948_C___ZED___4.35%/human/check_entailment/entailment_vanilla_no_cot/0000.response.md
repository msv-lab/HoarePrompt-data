Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all possible configurations of arrows. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. The program incorrectly assumes that if the second last arrow in the second row is not pointing to the right, the robot cannot reach the destination. This is not true because the robot can still reach the destination if there is a path that leads to the last cell.

2. The program does not correctly handle cases where the robot can switch rows and follow arrows to eventually reach the destination. It only checks for specific patterns of arrows, which is not sufficient.

3. The program incorrectly assumes that if all arrows in the second row at even indices are pointing to the right, the robot can reach the destination. This is not necessarily true because the robot might need to switch rows to reach the destination.

4. The program incorrectly assumes that if all arrows in the first row at odd indices (except the last one) are pointing to the right, the robot can reach the destination. This is not necessarily true for the same reason as above.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        visited = set()
        stack = [(1, 1)]  # Starting position (row, column)
        while stack:
            row, col = stack.pop()
            if (row, col) == (2, n):
                print('YES')
                break
            if (row, col) in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((row, col))
            if row == 1:
                if col < n:
                    stack.append((1, col + 1))
                    if a[col] == '>':
                        stack.append((1, col + 1))
                    elif a[col] == '<':
                        stack.append((1, col - 1))
                if col > 1:
                    stack.append((1, col - 1))
                stack.append((2, col))
            else:
                if col < n:
                    stack.append((2, col + 1))
                    if b[col] == '>':
                        stack.append((2, col + 1))
                    elif b[col] == '<':
                        stack.append((2, col - 1))
                if col > 1:
                    stack.append((2, col - 1))
                stack.append((1, col))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths the robot can take and checks if it can reach the destination cell (2, n).
