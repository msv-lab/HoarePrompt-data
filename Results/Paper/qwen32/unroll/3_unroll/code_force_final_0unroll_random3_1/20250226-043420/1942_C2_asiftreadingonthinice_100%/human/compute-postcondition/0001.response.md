The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop will execute `tt` times, where `tt` is the number of test cases. To ensure the loop executes, `tt` must be at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `tt`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) are part of the input data for each test case and are not directly related to the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `tt` is at least 1. The other variables can remain as they are because they are part of the input data for each test case.

State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
