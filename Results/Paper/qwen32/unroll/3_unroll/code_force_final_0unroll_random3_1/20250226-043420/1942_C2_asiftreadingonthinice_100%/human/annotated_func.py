#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of chosen vertices on a line of `n` vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents the maximum number of additional vertices Bessie can choose, given the constraints of `x` (the number of initially chosen vertices), `y` (an additional parameter affecting the calculation), and the specific positions of the initially chosen vertices. The final output for each test case is the minimum of the calculated value and `n - 2`.
