The code sorts the list `trumps` in descending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `trumps` list will be in a sorted state with its elements ordered from highest to lowest.

Output State: **`t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `trump` remains the same; `cards` remains the same; `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order; `answers` will contain additional pairs; `suits` will have all values set to `None`.**
