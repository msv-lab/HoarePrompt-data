Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send for at least 2 friends to come to the party. The logic for handling the cases where `n > 2` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i` is not sufficient to guarantee that sending 2 invitations will result in 2 friends coming to the party. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider cycles in the best friend relationships and determine the smallest set of friends to invite such that at least two of them and their best friends are invited. The current implementation does not account for all possible scenarios and may incorrectly output 2 or 3 invitations in cases where a different number is required.

Here's a more correct approach:

1. Identify cycles in the best friend relationships.
2. For cycles of length 2, only 2 invitations are needed.
3. For cycles of length greater than 2, more than 2 invitations may be required.
4. Ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

A correct implementation would involve more sophisticated cycle detection and handling logic.
