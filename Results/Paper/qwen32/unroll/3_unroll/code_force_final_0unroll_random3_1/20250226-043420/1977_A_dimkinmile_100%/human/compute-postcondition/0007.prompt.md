You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n is the number of moves Nikita can make and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100), where `n` is the number of moves Nikita can make and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. For each test case, if the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even, the current test case satisfies the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. Otherwise, either `n - m` is not divisible by 2 or `n - m` is less than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters directly as per the provided code snippet. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of moves Nikita can make and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. The function returns a result for each test case, indicating whether the desired number of cubes can be achieved with the given number of moves.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
