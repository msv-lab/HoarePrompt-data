### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the problem and the program. It correctly identifies the key condition that needs to be satisfied for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is indeed the correct logical check to determine if it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

- **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. Since each move changes the number of cubes by 1, an even difference means we can reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes by an even number of moves.
- **`n - m >= 0`**: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the number of cubes we want to have. If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

The assessment also correctly verifies the program with the provided examples, showing that the program's output matches the expected results for each test case.

### Edge Cases:
- **`n = m`**: This should return "Yes" because we can simply add one cube per move.
- **`n > m`**: This should return "Yes" if `n - m` is even, because we can add `m` cubes and then remove `(n - m)` cubes in pairs.
- **`n < m`**: This should return "No" because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the program's state and behavior at each step, further validating the original assessment. There are no discrepancies between the problem description, the program code, and the annotations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all valid inputs as expected.

**Final: True**
