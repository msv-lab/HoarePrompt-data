Postcondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100), where `n` is the number of moves Nikita can make and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the current test case input. Either `n - m` is not divisible by 2, or `n - m` is less than 0.**
