### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing exactly one cube.

The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it checks whether the difference `n - m` is non-negative and even. This is because:
- If `n - m` is even, it means that the total number of moves required to balance the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes can be achieved by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
- If `n - m` is non-negative, it ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach the desired number of cubes (or more, which can be adjusted by removing cubes).

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Otherwise, it is not possible.

The provided program correctly implements this logic in the `func_1` function:
- It reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`.
- If true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

### Example Walkthrough:
1. **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n - m = 0`, which is even and non-negative.
   - Expected Output: "Yes"
   - Program Output: "Yes"

2. **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n - m = -2`, which is even but negative.
   - Expected Output: "No"
   - Program Output: "No"

3. **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n - m = 2`, which is even and non-negative.
   - Expected Output: "Yes"
   - Program Output: "Yes"

The program correctly handles all provided test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
