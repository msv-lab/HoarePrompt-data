### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program step-by-step using the given function summary and the problem constraints.

#### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Key Observations:
- Each move changes the number of cubes by Â±1.
- Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes can only be an integer `k` such that `|k| <= n`.
- To have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, `m` must be reachable from 0 in `n` moves. This means `m` must be within the range `[-n, n]`.
- Additionally, since each move changes the number of cubes by 1, the parity (oddness or evenness) of the number of cubes must match the parity of `n`. Specifically, `m` and `n` must have the same parity (both odd or both even) because an even number of moves can only change the parity of the number of cubes an even number of times, and an odd number of moves can only change the parity an odd number of times.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `kreker` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`.

- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity.
- The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n` (since `m` cannot be greater than `n` moves away from 0).

However, the condition `n - m >= 0` is not necessary to determine if `m` is reachable from 0 in `n` moves. The correct condition should be:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to check for the same parity.
- `m <= n` to ensure `m` is within the reachable range.

Given the problem constraints, `m` is always at least 1, so `n - m >= 0` is effectively ensuring `m <= n` in this specific context. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem constraints.

#### Function Summary Validation:
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it determines if the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even, printing "Yes" if true and "No" otherwise. This is accurate as per the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct for the given problem constraints. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
