You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

            print(ans)
        
    #State: t is an input integer, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, s is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if there is no suitable string (which is the case when `n` is 1), the program should print "NO". However, the code incorrectly handles this case by printing "NO" only when `n` is 1, but it does not correctly handle other cases where `n` is an odd number greater than 1. 

For example, when `n` is 3, the code will output "YES" followed by "AAA", which is incorrect because "AAA" does not have exactly 3 special characters. The correct output for `n = 3` should be "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly 3 special characters in a string of length 3 where each character is either equal to its neighbor or not.

To fix this, the code should be modified to correctly handle all cases, especially when `n` is odd. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    import string
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the cases where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
