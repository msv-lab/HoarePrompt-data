The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet, ensuring that the string is composed of pairs of the same letter, and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string.
