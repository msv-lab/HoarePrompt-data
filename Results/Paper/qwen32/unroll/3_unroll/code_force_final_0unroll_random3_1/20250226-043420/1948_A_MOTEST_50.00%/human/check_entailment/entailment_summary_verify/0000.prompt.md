You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet, ensuring that the string is composed of pairs of the same letter, and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if there is no suitable string (which is the case when `n` is 1), the program should print "NO". However, the code incorrectly handles this case by printing "NO" only when `n` is 1, but it does not correctly handle other cases where `n` is an odd number greater than 1. 

For example, when `n` is 3, the code will output "YES" followed by "AAA", which is incorrect because "AAA" does not have exactly 3 special characters. The correct output for `n = 3` should be "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly 3 special characters in a string of length 3 where each character is either equal to its neighbor or not.

To fix this, the code should be modified to correctly handle all cases, especially when `n` is odd. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    import string
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the cases where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
