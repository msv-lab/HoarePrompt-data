### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and check if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `t` (number of test cases) and then for each test case, it reads `n` (number of special characters required).

2. **Special Case Handling for n = 1**: The program correctly identifies that if `n` is 1, it is impossible to create a string with exactly 1 special character and prints `NO`.

3. **Constructing the String for n > 1**:
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of different letters. For example, for `n = 6`, it could produce `AABBCC`. Here, positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are special, which is `n` special characters.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with `AAA` and then repeats pairs of different letters. For example, for `n = 5`, it could produce `AAABB`. Here, positions 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are special, which is `n` special characters.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints `YES` followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be formed, and `NO` if it cannot.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 by printing `NO`.
- For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string that meets the criteria of having exactly `n` special characters.
- The constructed string is always of length at most 200, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly.

**Correctness: True**
