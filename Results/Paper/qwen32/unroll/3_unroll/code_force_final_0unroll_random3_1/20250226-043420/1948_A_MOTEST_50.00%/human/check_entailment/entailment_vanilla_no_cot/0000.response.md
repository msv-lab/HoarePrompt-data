Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not handle the case when `n == 1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n == 1`, there should be a string of length 2 with exactly one special character. For example, "AA" or "BB" would be valid outputs for `n == 1`. However, the current implementation prints "NO" for `n == 1`, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the program does not handle all cases where `n` is odd correctly. For example, when `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then adds pairs of different letters, but it does not ensure that the final string has exactly `n` special characters. The logic should be adjusted to ensure that the final string has exactly `n` special characters for all valid `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import string

def func():
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')  # or any other string of length 2 with one special character
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans = s[x] * 3  # Start with three of the same character
                x += 1
                for j in range((n - 1) // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version handles the case when `n == 1` by returning "YES" and a string of length 2 with one special character. It also correctly handles the case when `n` is odd by starting with three of the same character and then adding pairs of different characters.
