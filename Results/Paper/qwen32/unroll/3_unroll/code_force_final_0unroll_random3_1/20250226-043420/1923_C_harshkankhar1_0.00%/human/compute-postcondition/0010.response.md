Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each test case, it calculates cumulative sums of the list and answers queries about sublists, printing "YES" or "NO" based on specific conditions. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with constraints on the total number of elements and queries across all test cases.**
