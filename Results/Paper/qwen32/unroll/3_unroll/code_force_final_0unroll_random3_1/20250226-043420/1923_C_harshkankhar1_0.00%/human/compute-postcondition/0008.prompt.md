Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the original list `a`; `b` is a list of n + 1 integers where b[i] is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on whether a[i] > 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
