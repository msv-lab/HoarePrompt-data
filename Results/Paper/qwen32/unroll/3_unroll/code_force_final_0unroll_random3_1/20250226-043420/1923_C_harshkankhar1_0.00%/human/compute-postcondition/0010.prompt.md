You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next n elements are the integers read from the input; `b` is a list of n + 1 integers where b[i] is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on whether a[i] > 1.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: a[0] a[1] a[2] ... a[n-1] (where each a[i] is the cumulative sum of the first i+1 elements of the list c)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: the loop has executed q times, printing "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions specified, with t, n, q, c, a, and b remaining unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list `c` of `n` integers. For each query, which is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`, the function processes the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive). The function returns the result of each query, which is not specified in the given constraints and relationships. The function handles up to `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of all `q` values across test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
