### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the problem requirements and the provided code to determine if the code correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
A subarray `c[l_i : r_i]` is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length where:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray `c[l_i : r_i]` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
2. No element in `c[l_i : r_i]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The input is read and parsed.
   - `a` is initialized as the input array `c` with a leading 0 for easier indexing.
   - `b` is initialized as an array of zeros with the same length as `a`.

2. **Building `b`**:
   - For each element in `a` (starting from index 1), `b[i]` is set to `b[i-1] + 1` if `a[i] > 1`, otherwise `b[i] = b[i-1] + 2`.
   - This step is intended to create a `b` array where the sum of `b` is at least the sum of `a` (with a slight increment to ensure `a[i] != b[i]`).

3. **Accumulate Sums**:
   - `a` is transformed into a prefix sum array using `accumulate`.
   - This allows for quick computation of the sum of any subarray `c[l_i : r_i]` using `a[r_i] - a[l_i - 1]`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the sum of the subarray `c[l_i : r_i]` is compared against the sum of the corresponding segment in `b`.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is used to determine if the subarray is good. If this condition is true, "NO" is printed; otherwise, "YES" is printed.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Condition for Good Subarray**:
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is flawed.
   - It does not ensure that all elements in `b` are positive.
   - It does not ensure that `a[i] != b[i]` for all `i` in the subarray.
   - The condition `x == y` is not a valid check for the subarray being good.

2. **Constructing `b`**:
   - The construction of `b` does not guarantee that `b` can be adjusted to match the sum of `c[l_i : r_i]` while ensuring all elements in `b` are positive and different from `c[l_i : r_i]`.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine if a subarray is good, we need to ensure:
- The sum of `b` matches the sum of the subarray.
- Each element in `b` is positive and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.

A correct approach would involve constructing `b` such that:
- If `c[i] > 1`, set `b[i]` to `c[i] - 1` (ensuring `b[i]` is positive and different from `c[i]`).
- If `c[i] == 1`, set `b[i]` to `2` (ensuring `b[i]` is positive and different from `c[i]`).

Then, check if the sum of `b[l_i : r_i]` equals the sum of `c[l_i : r_i]`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified with the provided code, it is clear that the code does not correctly determine if a subarray is good based on the problem's criteria.

**Final: False**
