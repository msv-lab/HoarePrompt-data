The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4, which already ensures that the loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized within the `range` function, so no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

However, the state of `answers` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4, `answers` is an empty list**
