Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives six integers: `h` (height), `w` (width), `x_a`, `y_a` (coordinates of point A), and `x_b`, `y_b` (coordinates of point B). The function checks the relationship between points A and B within a rectangle of dimensions `h` by `w`. If the coordinates are valid and the points are not the same, it determines whether the points are in the same row, the same column, or neither, and returns a corresponding result for each test case.**
