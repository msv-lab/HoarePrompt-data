The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the iterable is `answers`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `answers` must be a list that contains at least one element. The state of `j` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it will be assigned the first element of `answers` during the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `answers` must be a list with at least one string ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw').

State: **`answers` is a list of length `test_cases` containing at least one string ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw')**
