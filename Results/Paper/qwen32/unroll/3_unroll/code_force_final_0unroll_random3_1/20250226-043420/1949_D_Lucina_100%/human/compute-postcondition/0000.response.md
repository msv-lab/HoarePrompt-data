Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `n` is assigned the value of the input integer. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the transition video type between scenarios i and j, where '?' indicates an undecided video, 'F' indicates a funny video, 'S' indicates a scary video, and '.' indicates i=j. The input guarantees that the i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j, and that at most floor(n/2) transition videos are already decided.**

In simpler terms, `n` is now the integer value input by the user, which represents the number of lines and characters per line in the subsequent input. The conditions and guarantees about the characters in the input remain unchanged.
