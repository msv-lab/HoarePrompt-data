n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where 'F' indicates a funny transition video, 'S' indicates a scary transition video, '?' indicates an undecided transition video, and '.' indicates the same scenario (i.e., i=j). The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. There are at most ⌊n/2⌋ decided transition videos (i.e., 'F' or 'S').
