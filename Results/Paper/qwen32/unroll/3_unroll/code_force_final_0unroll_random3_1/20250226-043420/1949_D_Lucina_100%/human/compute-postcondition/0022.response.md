The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input also consists of `n` lines, each containing `n` characters. Each character in the i-th line represents the transition video type between scenarios `i` and `j`, where `j` is the position of the character in the line. The characters can be 'F' (funny video), 'S' (scary video), '?' (undecided video), or '.' (indicating i=j). The input guarantees symmetry in the matrix (i.e., the i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line) and that at most floor(n/2) transition videos are already decided.

The function returns:
- Case_1: A valid configuration of the matrix where all '?' characters are replaced with either 'F' or 'S' such that the constraints are satisfied.
- Case_2: If it is not possible to replace all '?' characters while satisfying the constraints, the function returns an error message indicating that it is not possible to decide the transition videos.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix of characters representing transition video types between scenarios, and returns a valid configuration of the matrix with all '?' characters replaced by 'F' or 'S' if possible, otherwise returns an error message.**
