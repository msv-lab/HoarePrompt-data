The given Python code snippet only initializes a list `xx` with a single empty string. None of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are affected by this code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `xx` is `['']`**
