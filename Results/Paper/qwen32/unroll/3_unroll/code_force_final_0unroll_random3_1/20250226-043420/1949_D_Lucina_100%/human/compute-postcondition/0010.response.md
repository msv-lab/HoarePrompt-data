Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the count of 'F's involving the `i`-th position, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the count of 'S's involving the `i`-th position, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, the first being `''` and the rest being the input strings, `sa` is a list of indices where there are 'F's but no 'S's, `sb` is a list of indices where there are 'S's but no 'F's, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
