Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the count of 'F's involving the `i`-th position, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the count of 'S's involving the `i`-th position, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, the first being `''`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `xx` contains the transformed strings based on the presence of '?' characters and the indices in `sa`, and `sa` includes any indices where both 'F' and 'S' counts are zero. Otherwise, `xx` is set to `['', 'SSFSS', 'SFFFF', 'SSFSS', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF']`. `sa` is a list of indices where there are 'F's but no 'S's, plus any indices where both 'F' and 'S' counts are zero, and `sb` is a list of indices where there are 'S's but no 'F's.**
