Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix of characters representing transition video types between scenarios. It then replaces all '?' characters in the matrix with either 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F's and 'S's in each row/column, ensuring that the resulting matrix is valid according to the rules provided. The function outputs the modified matrix.**
