The code creates a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0.**
