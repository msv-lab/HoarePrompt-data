Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `dp` Array**: The `dp` array is initialized with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, but it is not clear how this array is supposed to be used. The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to keep track of the optimal scores for both players.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Cards**: The `cards.count(j + 1)` operation is inefficient and can be slow, especially for large values of `n` (up to `2 * 10^5`). This operation is called multiple times in nested loops, which can lead to a time complexity of O(n^3), which is not feasible given the problem constraints.

3. **Incorrect Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transitions in the `dp` array do not correctly reflect the rules of the game. The code attempts to use a dynamic programming approach but does not account for the optimal moves of both players.

4. **Lack of Explanation for `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to process each test case, but there is no clear explanation of how it works or why it is correct. The logic inside `func_1` is not aligned with the problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming with memoization or a greedy strategy that takes into account the optimal moves of both players. The current implementation does not handle these aspects correctly.

Here is a potential counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

The provided code might not handle this case correctly due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
