The code snippet `cards = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `cards`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer representing the number of cards, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are the integers on the cards. After executing the code, `cards` will hold these integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand.**
