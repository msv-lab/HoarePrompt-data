In the given for loop, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function with parameters `n - 3`, `-1`, and `-1`. This means the loop will iterate from `n - 3` down to `0`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least `3`. If `n` is less than `3`, the range `(n - 3, -1, -1)` will be invalid and the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `3`.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value will be `n - 3`. The other variables `cards` and `dp` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cards each player receives and must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of `n` integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, `i` is `n - 3`**
