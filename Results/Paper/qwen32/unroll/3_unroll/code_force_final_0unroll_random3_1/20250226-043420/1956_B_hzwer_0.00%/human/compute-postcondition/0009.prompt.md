You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with values updated based on the maximum number of cards that can be collected without picking two consecutive cards of the same value.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[0][0]`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It returns the value of `dp[0][0]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `dp[0][0]`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
