Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The program incorrectly assumes that if there is a pile with exactly 1 stone, Bob will win. However, the game is more complex than that and depends on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

The correct approach to determine the winner is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (Alice in this case). Otherwise, it is winning for the player about to move (Alice in this case).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for stones in l:
            nim_sum ^= stones
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This program calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
