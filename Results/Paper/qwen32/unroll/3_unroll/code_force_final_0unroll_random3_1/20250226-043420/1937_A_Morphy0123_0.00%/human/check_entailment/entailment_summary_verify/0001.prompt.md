You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each test case, it outputs the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
- We start with an array `a` of length `n` where `a[i] = i` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
- We perform a series of `swap(k)` operations for `k` ranging from `2` to `n`.
- In each `swap(k)` operation, we find the largest divisor `d` of `k` (other than `k` itself) and swap `a[d]` and `a[k]`.
- After performing all the swaps, we need to determine the position `j` such that `a[j] = 1`.

### Key Observations:
- The number `1` starts at position `1` and will only be swapped if there is a `k` such that `d = 1` (i.e., `k` is a prime number).
- However, the key insight is that `1` will be moved to the position of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- If `n` is `1`, the position of `1` remains `1`.
- For `n > 1`, the position of `1` after all swaps will be the largest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads the value of `n`.
- If `n` is `1`, it correctly prints `1`.
- For `n > 1`, it calculates the largest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n` using a loop that increments `power` until `2 ** power` exceeds `log2(n)`. This part of the code is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the largest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would be to find the highest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n`. This can be done using `2 ** int(log2(n))`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the position of `1` in the array after performing the swaps for all `n > 1`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
