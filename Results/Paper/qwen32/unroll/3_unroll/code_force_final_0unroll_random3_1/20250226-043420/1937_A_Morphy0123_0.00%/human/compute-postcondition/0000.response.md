The code snippet reads the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. This value is assigned to the variable `n_cases`. The initial state mentioned that `t` is the number of test cases, and `n` is the length of the array `a` for each test case. After executing the code snippet, the value of `t` is now stored in `n_cases`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n_cases` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4), `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the array `a` for each test case (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9)**
