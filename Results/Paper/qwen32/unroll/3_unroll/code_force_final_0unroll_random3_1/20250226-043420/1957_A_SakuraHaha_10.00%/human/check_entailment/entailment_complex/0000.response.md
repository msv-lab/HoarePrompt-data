### Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on the idea that a regular polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length. However, the implementation provided in the function `func_1()` only counts the number of sets of 4 sticks of the same length and sums these counts to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

This is incorrect because it does not consider polygons with fewer than 4 sides (triangles, for example), and it also does not consider polygons with more than 4 sides (pentagons, hexagons, etc.). The problem statement does not specify a minimum or maximum number of sides for the polygons, so the solution should account for all possible regular polygons that can be formed with the given sticks.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program is **incorrect** because it only considers sets of 4 sticks of the same length, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
