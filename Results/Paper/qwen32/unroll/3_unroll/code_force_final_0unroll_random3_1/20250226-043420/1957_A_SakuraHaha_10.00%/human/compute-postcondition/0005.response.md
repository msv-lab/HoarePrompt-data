Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that length appears in `a`.**
