Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The function determines if it is possible to form a triangle using any three of the given sticks and returns "YES" if it is possible, otherwise "NO".**
