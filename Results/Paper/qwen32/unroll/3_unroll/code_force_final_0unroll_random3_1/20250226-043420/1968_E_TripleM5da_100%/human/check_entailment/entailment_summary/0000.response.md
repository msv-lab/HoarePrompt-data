### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a set of points for each test case that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances. However, the strategy used in the program does not guarantee that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances will be achieved.

Here's a breakdown of the program's approach:
- It starts by placing the first point at `(1, 1)`.
- It places the second point at `(1, 2)`.
- For each subsequent point (from the third to the nth), it places the point at `(i, i)`.

Let's analyze the Manhattan distances for this arrangement:
- The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is `1`.
- The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` is `|1 - i| + |1 - i| = 2(i - 1)`.
- The distance between `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` is `|1 - i| + |2 - i| = 2(i - 1) - 1`.

This strategy will generate some distinct Manhattan distances, but it does not cover all possible distances. For example, it does not generate distances like `2`, `3`, `4`, etc., which could be achieved by placing points in a different manner.

The optimal strategy to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances involves placing points in a way that they cover a wide range of possible distances. The provided examples in the problem statement show more optimal placements.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not necessarily generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Correctness: **False**
