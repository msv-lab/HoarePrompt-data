To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to evaluate whether it maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case.

The provided program starts by placing the first point at (1,1) and the second point at (1,2). For the remaining points, it places them along the line \(y=x\) from (3,3) to (n,n).

Let's analyze the output for different values of \(n\):

1. **For \(n=2\)**:
   - Points: (1,1) and (1,2)
   - Distances: \(|1-1|+|1-1|=0\), \(|1-1|+|2-2|=0\), \(|1-1|+|1-2|=1\)
   - Distinct distances: \(\{0,1\}\)
   - This is correct, as the maximum number of distinct distances is 2.

2. **For \(n=3\)**:
   - Points: (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3)
   - Distances: \(|1-1|+|1-1|=0\), \(|1-1|+|2-2|=0\), \(|1-1|+|1-2|=1\), \(|1-3|+|1-3|=4\), \(|1-3|+|2-3|=3\), \(|3-3|+|3-3|=0\)
   - Distinct distances: \(\{0,1,3,4\}\)
   - This is not optimal. The optimal set of points for \(n=3\) should result in more distinct distances. For example, placing points at (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1) would yield distinct distances \(\{0,1,2,3\}\).

3. **For \(n=4\)**:
   - Points: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)
   - Distances: \(|1-1|+|1-1|=0\), \(|1-1|+|2-2|=0\), \(|1-1|+|1-2|=1\), \(|1-3|+|1-3|=4\), \(|1-3|+|2-3|=3\), \(|1-4|+|1-4|=6\), \(|1-4|+|2-4|=5\), \(|3-3|+|3-3|=0\), \(|3-4|+|3-4|=2\), \(|4-4|+|4-4|=0\)
   - Distinct distances: \(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)
   - This is not optimal. The optimal set of points for \(n=4\) should result in more distinct distances. For example, placing points at (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), and (4,4) would yield distinct distances \(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}\).

The pattern observed in the program does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for \(n \geq 3\). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
