Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally in the card game described. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - It calculates the number of pairs in your hand using `Counter` from the `collections` module.
   - It counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in the list `a` (which represents the cards in your hand).
   - The maximum points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and half the total number of cards you have (`n // 2`). This is because you can only score a point when you play a card that has already been played (i.e., its pair is on the table). Since there are `n` cards in total and each player takes `n` turns, you can only play a card that has a pair on the table at most `n // 2` times.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads the input data, which includes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a` in your hand.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, a)` to calculate the maximum points you can get and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic and implementation of both functions align with the problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
