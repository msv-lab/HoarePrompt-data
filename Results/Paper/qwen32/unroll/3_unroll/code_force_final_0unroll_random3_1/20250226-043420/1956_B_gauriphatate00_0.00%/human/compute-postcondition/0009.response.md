The provided loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. Since the loop only involves printing and does not modify any of the variables (`idx`, `n`, `a`, `t`, `data`, `results`), the state of these variables will remain unchanged after the loop completes.

Output State: **`idx` is the total number of elements processed in `data`, `n` is the value used in the last iteration, `a` is the list of integers used in the last iteration, `t` remains the same, `data` remains the same, and `results` is a list of results from `func_1` for each iteration.**
