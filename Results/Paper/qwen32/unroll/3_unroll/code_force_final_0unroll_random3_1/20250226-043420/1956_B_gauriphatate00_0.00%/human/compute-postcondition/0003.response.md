`t` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of `data[idx]`. Since `idx` is 0, `t` will be the integer value of the first element in the `data` list. The values of `n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards you and Nene each receive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 0, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
