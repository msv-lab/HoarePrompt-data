The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list `results` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The other variables (`idx`, `n`, `a`, `t`, `data`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The variable `result` should be the first element in the `results` list.

State: **`idx` is the total number of elements processed in `data`, `n` is the value used in the last iteration, `a` is the list of integers used in the last iteration, `t` remains the same, `data` remains the same, and `results` is a list of results from `func_1` for each iteration that must have at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in the `results` list**
