Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The problem description involves a card game where each player tries to maximize their score by placing cards on a table. The key point is that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a)`: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get given the number of cards `n` and the list `a` of integers on your cards.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input data, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Analysis of `func_1(n, a)`:
- The function uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
- It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
- It returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This logic seems to be based on the idea that you can only get a point if there's already a card of the same number on the table, and since Nene plays optimally, she will try to minimize your points while maximizing hers. The value `n // 2` represents the maximum number of turns you can make.

### Analysis of `func_2()`:
- This function reads input data, processes each test case, and prints the results.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of integers.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints all the results.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of points you can get under the assumption that Nene plays optimally.
- The function handles the constraints given in the problem description, such as the maximum number of test cases and the maximum value of `n`.
- The program reads input data correctly and processes each test case independently.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `4\n1 1 2 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: You can get at most 1 point by placing the second `1` when there's already a `1` on the table.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `8\n7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: You can get at most 2 points by placing the second `8` and the second `5` when there are already cards of the same number on the table.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `8\n7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: You can get at most 1 point by placing the second `4` when there's already a `4` on the table.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: You cannot get any points since each number appears only once in your hand.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `1\n1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: You cannot get any points since there's only one card and no pair.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly handle the problem description and all the provided examples. It calculates the maximum number of points you can get by considering the pairs of numbers in your hand and the optimal play by Nene.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by considering the pairs of numbers in your hand and the optimal play by Nene. It handles all the provided examples correctly and adheres to the constraints given in the problem description.
