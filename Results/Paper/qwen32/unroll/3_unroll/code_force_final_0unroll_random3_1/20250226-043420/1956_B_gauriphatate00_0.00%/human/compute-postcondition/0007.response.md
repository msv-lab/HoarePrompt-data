To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, let's break down the loop's behavior step-by-step:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
2. For each iteration:
   - `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
   - `idx` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` is updated to a list of `n` integers starting from `data[idx]` up to `data[idx + n - 1]`.
   - `idx` is incremented by `n`.
   - `results` is appended with the result of `func_1(n, a)`.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the `idx`, `n`, `a`, and `results` will change. However, `t` and the initial `data` list will remain unchanged.

After the loop completes, the output state will be:
- `idx` will be `1 + t + sum(n for each iteration)`, which is the total number of elements processed in `data`.
- `n` will be the value used in the last iteration of the loop.
- `a` will be the list of integers used in the last iteration of the loop.
- `results` will be a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.

The final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`idx` is the total number of elements processed in `data`, `n` is the value used in the last iteration, `a` is the list of integers used in the last iteration, `t` remains the same, `data` remains the same, and `results` is a list of results from `func_1` for each iteration.**
