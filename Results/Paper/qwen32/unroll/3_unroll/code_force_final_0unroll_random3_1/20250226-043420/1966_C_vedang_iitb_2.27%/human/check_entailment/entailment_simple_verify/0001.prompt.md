You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where players take stones from piles in a specific way. The key point is that in each turn, a player must remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile, and the number of stones removed cannot exceed the size of the smallest non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers (or Nimbers) from combinatorial game theory. However, a simpler observation can be made based on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, the first player (Alice) can force a win. If it's even, the second player (Bob) can force a win. This is because each move can change the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to be calculating some kind of differential array from the sorted unique elements of the list `a`. However, this does not directly relate to determining the winner of the game.
   - For example, if `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, `func_1(a)` will return `[3]` because all elements are the same, and the differential array will only have one element.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the configuration of the piles.
   - The base cases handle specific scenarios for `n = 1` and `n = 2`, but these do not cover the general case.
   - The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` is intended to determine the winner for the remaining piles, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly account for the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. It does not consider the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones, which is the correct approach to solving this problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should count the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If this count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
