### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` and see if they correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
The game is a variant of the Nim game where players remove stones from piles, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The key to solving this game is to understand the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) in combinatorial game theory. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (assuming optimal play). Otherwise, it is a winning position.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a list `a` and returns a new list where each element (except the first) is the difference between the current sorted unique element and the previous one.
   - This transformation seems unrelated to the game rules or determining the winner. It does not contribute to the logic of the game.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to determine the winner recursively based on the number of piles `n` and the stones in the piles `a`.
   - The function logic does not seem to follow the rules of the game or the concept of Nim-sum. The recursive logic does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players.

#### Example Test Case:
Let's consider the test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3

Expected Output:
Alice
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- Alice can choose `k=1` on her first turn, reducing the piles to `[0, 1, 2]`.
- Bob then chooses `k=1`, reducing the piles to `[0, 0, 1]`.
- Alice chooses `k=1`, reducing the piles to `[0, 0, 0]`.
- Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

However, the provided function `func_2` does not correctly handle this scenario. The function does not simulate the game rules or follow the optimal moves for both players.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game. The function `func_1` is not needed for the problem, and `func_2` does not correctly simulate the game rules or follow the optimal moves for both players.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
