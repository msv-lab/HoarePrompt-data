The function `func_2` determines a winning strategy for a game involving piles of stones. It accepts a list `a` of integers representing the number of stones in each pile and a positive integer `n` representing the number of piles such that `n == len(a)`. The function returns 1 if the current player can force a win, and 2 if the opponent can force a win, based on the configuration of the piles.
