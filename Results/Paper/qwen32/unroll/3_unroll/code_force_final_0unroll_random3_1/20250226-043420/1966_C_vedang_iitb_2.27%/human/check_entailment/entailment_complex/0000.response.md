### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the optimal play of both players. The game revolves around removing stones from piles, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The solution consists of two main functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which process the input and determine the winner, respectively.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function processes the list of pile sizes to derive a new list that represents the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
- **Implementation**: 
  - It first creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes.
  - Then, it calculates the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted list.
  - The result is a list where the first element is the smallest unique pile size, and each subsequent element is the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes.
- **Correctness**: The transformation performed by `func_1` is correct in the context of the game, as it simplifies the problem by focusing on the differences between pile sizes.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list of pile sizes.
- **Implementation**:
  - It uses recursion to analyze the game state.
  - For a single pile, Alice wins.
  - For two piles, the winner depends on whether the smaller pile size is even or odd.
  - For more than two piles, it recursively determines the winner of the game with one less pile and uses this information to decide the winner for the current configuration.
- **Correctness**: The logic implemented in `func_2` is based on the principle of optimal play and the game theory concept of Nim-sum (XOR operation), although it is implemented differently here. The function correctly determines the winner based on the transformed list of pile sizes.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game for each test case. The transformations and recursive analysis in `func_1` and `func_2` align with the problem's requirements and the principles of optimal play.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
