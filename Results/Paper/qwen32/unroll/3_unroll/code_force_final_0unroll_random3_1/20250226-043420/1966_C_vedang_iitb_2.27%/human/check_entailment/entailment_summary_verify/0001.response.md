### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. The key insight for solving the problem is to count the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If this count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because each move can change the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones, and the player who starts with an odd count of such piles can force a win.

Let's analyze the provided code in the context of this insight:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates a differential array from the sorted unique elements of the list `a`. However, this does not help in determining the winner of the game. The function does not contribute to the correct logic for solving the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is intended to determine the winner based on the configuration of the piles. However, its logic is flawed. It does not correctly account for the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
   - For example, the base cases for `n = 1` and `n = 2` do not cover the general case. The recursive logic does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules.

Given the problem description and the correct approach, the provided code does not implement the correct logic. The correct approach involves counting the number of piles with an odd number of stones and determining the winner based on the parity of this count.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
