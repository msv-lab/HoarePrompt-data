Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and three lists: `A` (of length `n`), `D` (of length `m`), and `F` (of length `k`). The list `A` contains integers representing the complexities of prepared problems, sorted in ascending order. The list `D` contains unique integers representing the complexities of models, sorted in ascending order. The list `F` contains integers representing the complexities of functions. The function returns the number of functions that can be matched with both a problem and a model, where the complexity of the function is between the complexity of the problem and the complexity of the model.**
