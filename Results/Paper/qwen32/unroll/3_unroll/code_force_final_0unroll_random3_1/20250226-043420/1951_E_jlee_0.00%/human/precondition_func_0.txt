The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
