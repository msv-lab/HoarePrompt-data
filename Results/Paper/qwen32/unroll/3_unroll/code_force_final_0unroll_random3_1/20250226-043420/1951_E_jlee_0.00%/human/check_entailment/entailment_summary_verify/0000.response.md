Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program needs to handle multiple test cases and provide a valid partition if possible, or determine that no such partition exists.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to handle different cases based on the first and last characters of the string, the count of the first character, and other patterns. However, the program does not ensure that it covers all possible scenarios for partitioning the string into non-palindrome substrings.

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary suggests that the program checks for specific patterns to determine if a valid partition exists. Specifically, it looks for cases where the first and last characters of the string differ, or where a character appears only once in the middle. However, this approach is not comprehensive enough to handle all cases.

### Case Analysis

Let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:

```
Input:
1
abacaba

Expected Output:
YES
3
aba cab a
```

For the string `abacaba`, the program will not correctly identify a valid partition. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the length of the string is 1, which is not the case.
2. It then checks if the first and last characters are different, which they are not.
3. It checks if all characters in the string are the same, which they are not.
4. It checks if all characters except one are the same, which they are not.
5. It then enters a loop to check for specific patterns, but it fails to find a valid partition for `abacaba`.

### Correct Approach

A more comprehensive approach would be to split the string into substrings of length 2 or more, ensuring that each substring is not a palindrome. For example, for the string `abacaba`, a valid partition could be `aba cab a`.

### Implementation of Correct Approach

Here is a simpler and more effective implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        # Try to split the string into non-palindrome substrings
        result = []
        j = 0
        while j < n:
            # Find the longest non-palindrome substring starting at j
            for k in range(j + 2, n + 1):
                if string[j:k] != string[j:k][::-1]:
                    result.append(string[j:k])
                    j = k
                    break
            else:
                # If no non-palindrome substring of length 2 or more is found, return NO
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(len(result))
            print(' '.join(result))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly and fails to produce a valid partition for some inputs. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
