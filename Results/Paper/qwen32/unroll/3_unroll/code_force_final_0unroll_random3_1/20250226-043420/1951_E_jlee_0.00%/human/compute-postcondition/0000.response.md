Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The other conditions regarding the test cases and strings remain unchanged.
