You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines of results, each corresponding to one of the `t` test cases. For each test case, the output is either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by additional information if 'YES'. The 'NO' output indicates that it's not possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the first character of the first part is not equal to the last character of the second part, and the string cannot be split into two parts with a character that appears only once in the middle. The 'YES' output is followed by the number of splits needed (either 1 or 2) and the split strings if applicable. The state of the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` are not preserved between iterations and are reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a string `s` made up of lowercase Latin characters. The function processes these strings and returns the count of each unique character in the string for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
