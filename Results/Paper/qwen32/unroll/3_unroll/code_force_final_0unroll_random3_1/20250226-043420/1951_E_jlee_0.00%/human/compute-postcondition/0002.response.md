Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines of results, each corresponding to one of the `t` test cases. For each test case, the output is either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by additional information if 'YES'. The 'NO' output indicates that it's not possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the first character of the first part is not equal to the last character of the second part, and the string cannot be split into two parts with a character that appears only once in the middle. The 'YES' output is followed by the number of splits needed (either 1 or 2) and the split strings if applicable. The state of the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` are not preserved between iterations and are reset for each test case.**
