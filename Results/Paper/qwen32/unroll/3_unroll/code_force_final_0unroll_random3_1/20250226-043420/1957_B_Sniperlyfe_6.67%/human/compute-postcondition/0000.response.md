The code snippet creates a list named `nums` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9` still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**
