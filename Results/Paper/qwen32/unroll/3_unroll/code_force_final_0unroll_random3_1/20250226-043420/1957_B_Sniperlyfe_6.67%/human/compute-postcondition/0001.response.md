The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop index and does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function.

Before the loop starts, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` are given. The value of `t` does not affect the execution of the loop, and `k` is also not relevant to the loop's execution. The list `nums` being a list of `n` zeros does not affect whether the loop can execute or not.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Since the problem states that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, this condition is already satisfied by the problem constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros**
