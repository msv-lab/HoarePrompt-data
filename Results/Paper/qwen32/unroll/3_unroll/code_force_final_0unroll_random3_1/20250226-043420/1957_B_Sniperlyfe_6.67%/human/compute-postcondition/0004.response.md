To determine the output state, we need to understand how the list `nums` is constructed based on the given initial state:

1. `nums` is a list of `n` elements.
2. Each element in `nums` is the largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k` at the start of that iteration.
3. The last element of `nums` (`nums[-1]`) is increased by `k`.

Let's break it down:

- The largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k` is `2^b - 1`, where `b` is the number of bits in `k`.
- `k` will be reduced by the sum of the values assigned to `nums`.

However, the problem does not specify how `k` is reduced in each iteration, but it does specify the construction of `nums`. The final `nums[-1]` is increased by the remaining `k` after constructing the rest of the list.

Given the constraints, we can infer that `nums` is constructed as follows:
- The first `n-1` elements of `nums` are `2^b - 1`.
- The last element of `nums` is `(2^b - 1) + k`.

Since the exact value of `k` after reduction is not specified, we will assume the construction process as described.

Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are the largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k` (i.e., `2^b - 1`), and the last element is this value plus `k`.**
