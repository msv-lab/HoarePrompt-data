Let's analyze the given loop and the state before the loop starts.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in s[::-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, `j` is the loop variable that will take on the values of the characters in the string `s` in reverse order. 

The state before the loop starts includes:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10
- `s` is a new input string consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`
- `ma` is 0
- `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`
- `m` is an input integer
- `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`
- `d` is 0
- `l` is an empty list

From the loop statement, the only variable that can be adjusted is `s` because `j` is the loop variable that will iterate over the characters of `s` in reverse order. 

Since the loop iterates over the string `s` in reverse, the only requirement is that `s` must be a non-empty string with at least one 'B'. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `c`, `d`, and `l`) are not directly related to the execution of the loop and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `s` is a string with at least one 'B'. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list**
