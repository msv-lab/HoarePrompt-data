Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`. The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the first 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2.**
