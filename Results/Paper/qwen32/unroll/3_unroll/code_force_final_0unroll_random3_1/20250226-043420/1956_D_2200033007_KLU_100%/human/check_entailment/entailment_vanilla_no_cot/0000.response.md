Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Global Variables and Scope Issues**: The program uses `arr`, `res_dict`, `start_index`, `res`, and other variables without properly defining them as global or passing them as parameters. This can lead to undefined behavior and errors.

2. **Logic Errors**: The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not correctly determine the MEX of a subarray and apply the operations to maximize the sum of the array. The approach seems to be more focused on partitioning the array and finding maximum sums, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to use the MEX operation.

3. **MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. The MEX operation is not implemented, and the program does not update the array elements based on the MEX value.

4. **Operation Construction**: The program does not correctly construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum. The `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented and does not align with the problem's requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array is already optimal or when the array has repeated elements.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. One possible strategy is to iteratively find the MEX of the entire array, update the array to this MEX value, and repeat this process until no further improvement can be made. This approach ensures that the array is transformed to maximize the sum using the allowed operations.
