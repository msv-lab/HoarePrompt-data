Let's carefully analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array `a` by performing a series of operations where each operation replaces a subarray with its MEX (Minimum EXcluded value). The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray defined by `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming with memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems.
   - The function considers three cases:
     - When the subarray length is 1, it returns the maximum of 1 and the current value of the element.
     - When the entire subarray can be turned into a sequence of consecutive integers from 0 to `length - 1` (which would maximize the sum to `length^2`).
     - It recursively considers splitting the subarray into smaller parts and calculates the maximum sum for each split, including the case where the MEX is used.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the optimal splits and operations.
   - It handles the base case where the subarray length is 1 and checks if the subarray can be turned into a sequence of consecutive integers.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is supposed to transform a subarray into a sequence of consecutive integers from 0 to `i`.
   - However, it has a critical issue: it uses a global `start_index` variable which is not defined within the function and causes a `NameError`. This function also modifies the global `arr` and `res` variables directly, which is not ideal for a recursive function.

### Issues and Corrections

- **Global Variables**: The use of global variables `start_index`, `arr`, and `res` within `make_stairs` is problematic. These should be passed as parameters to the function.
- **Logic for `make_stairs`**: The logic for transforming a subarray into a sequence of consecutive integers is correct, but it needs to be fixed to work properly without relying on global variables.
- **Memoization**: The memoization in `func_1` is efficient, but it should ensure that the recursive calls are correctly structured to avoid redundant calculations.

### Correctness

Given the issues with the `make_stairs` function and the reliance on global variables, the program as written is not correct. It will not run as intended and will likely produce incorrect results due to the `NameError`.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The program needs fixing to properly handle the transformation of subarrays and to avoid the use of global variables within recursive functions.
