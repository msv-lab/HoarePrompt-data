### Reasoning:

Let's analyze each function and how they interact to determine if the program meets the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index + 1]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - **Approach**: It uses a recursive strategy with memoization (via `res_dict`) to avoid recalculating results for the same subarray. It considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the sum for each possible split, keeping track of the maximum sum found.
   - **Output**: Returns the maximum sum possible for the given subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - **Approach**: It recursively identifies subarrays that contribute to the maximum sum and records the operations needed to transform these subarrays into the optimal configuration.
   - **Output**: Returns a list of tuples representing the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function modifies a subarray to form a "staircase" pattern where each element at index `start_index + j` is equal to `j`.
   - **Approach**: It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern. If not, it recursively modifies the subarray, recording the operations needed to achieve the staircase pattern.
   - **Output**: Modifies the subarray in place and appends tuples to the `res` list indicating the ranges that were modified.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - It correctly calculates the maximum sum possible for a subarray by considering all possible splits and recursively evaluating the sums.
  - The memoization ensures that the function does not recompute results for the same subarray, improving efficiency.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - It correctly identifies the subarrays that contribute to the maximum sum and records the operations needed to achieve this configuration.
  - It handles different cases, including when the maximum sum is achieved by making the entire subarray a staircase pattern.

- **Function `make_stairs`**:
  - It correctly modifies a subarray to form a staircase pattern, recording the operations needed.
  - It ensures that the subarray is modified in the correct order to achieve the desired pattern.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations and provides a sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The functions work together to ensure that the solution meets the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
