After carefully reviewing the provided program, I have identified several issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program lacks a definition for `res_dict`, `arr`, `res`, and `start_index`. These variables are used in the functions but are not defined anywhere in the provided code. This makes the program incomplete and unable to run as intended.

2. **Logical Errors**: The `make_stairs` function modifies the global `arr` array directly but does not ensure that the changes align with the problem requirements. The function also does not handle cases where the array segment is already in the desired form correctly.

3. **Missing Output**: The program does not generate the required output format. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the sequence of operations. The program does not return or print these values.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with a single element, or arrays with all elements being zero.

5. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray, which is crucial for determining the optimal operations to maximize the sum.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

**Correctness: False**.

### Explanation of Why the Program is Incorrect:
- **Incomplete Code**: The program is missing necessary variable definitions (`res_dict`, `arr`, `res`, `start_index`).
- **Logical Errors**: The `make_stairs` function does not correctly handle all cases and modifies the array improperly.
- **Missing Output**: The program does not generate the required output format.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle various edge cases effectively.
- **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of subarrays, which is essential for determining the optimal operations.
