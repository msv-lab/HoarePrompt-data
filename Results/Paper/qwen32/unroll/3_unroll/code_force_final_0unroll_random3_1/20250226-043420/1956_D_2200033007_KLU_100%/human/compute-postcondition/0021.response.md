Functionality: **The function `make_stairs` modifies a subarray of `arr` starting from `start_index` to ensure that the subarray represents a "staircase" pattern where each element at index `start_index + j` is equal to `j`. If the subarray does not already meet this condition, it appends tuples to the list `res` indicating the ranges that were modified, and updates the subarray elements accordingly. The function does not return any value.**
