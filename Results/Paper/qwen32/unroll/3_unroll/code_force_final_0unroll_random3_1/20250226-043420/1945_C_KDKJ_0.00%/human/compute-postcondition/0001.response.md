To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the functions involved. The loop iterates a number of times equal to the integer value provided by the user input. During each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`. However, the initial state specifies that no variables are present in the function signature of `func_2()`, and there is no information provided about the implementation of `func_1()`. This means we can only describe the state based on the loop's execution without knowing the side effects of `func_1()`.

The loop itself does not modify any variables in its head or body that are not already present. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the number of times `func_1()` is called, which is determined by the user input. Since there are no variables in the loop's head or body that are being modified or tracked, and no variables in `func_2()` to begin with, the output state remains the same as the initial state in terms of variable presence.

Output State: **No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2()`.**
