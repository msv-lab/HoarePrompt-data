### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to ensure the program meets the requirements.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Input**: 
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case:
    - Integer `n` (number of houses).
    - String `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, determine the position `i` after which the road should be laid to satisfy the conditions:
    - At least half of the residents on the left side of the road should want to live on the left side.
    - At least half of the residents on the right side of the road should want to live on the right side.
    - Among all suitable positions, choose the one closest to the middle (`|n/2 - i|` minimized).
    - If there are multiple such positions, choose the smallest `i`.

#### Provided Functions:
1. **`func_1`**:
   - Reads `n` and `a` from input.
   - Constructs a cumulative sum array `S` where `S[i]` contains the number of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to the `i`-th position.
   - Iterates through possible positions `i` to check if the balance condition is met:
     - `left` is the number of '0's on the left side.
     - `lsum` is the total number of houses on the left side.
     - `right` is the number of '1's on the right side.
     - `rsum` is the total number of houses on the right side.
     - Checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied.
     - Updates the answer `ans` if the current position is closer to the middle or if it's the first valid position found.
   - Prints the result `ans`.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Analysis:
- **Cumulative Sum Array `S`**:
  - `S` is correctly used to keep track of the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position.
- **Balance Condition**:
  - The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- **Choosing the Optimal `i`**:
  - The code correctly updates `ans` to the position that is closest to the middle and satisfies the balance condition.
  - If multiple positions are equally close to the middle, the smallest `i` is chosen due to the `<=` comparison in `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal position `i` for laying the road in each test case. It handles all given constraints and examples correctly.
