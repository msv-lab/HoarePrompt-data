Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates and updates the answer `ans`. Specifically, the condition for updating `ans` should not only check if the current position `i` satisfies the condition but also whether it is closer to the middle of the village compared to the current `ans`. If the current `i` is equally close to the middle but smaller, it should still be chosen.

Here's the problematic part of the code:

```python
if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
    continue
elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
    ans = i
```

The condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` should be `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)` to ensure that we choose the smaller `i` when there is a tie in distance to the middle. The current code does not update `ans` when `i` is closer or equal in distance to the middle but smaller.

To fix this, the condition should be:

```python
if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
    continue
elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans) or (abs(n / 2 - i) == abs(n / 2 - ans) and i < ans):
    ans = i
```

This ensures that `ans` is updated to the smaller `i` when there is a tie in the distance to the middle.
