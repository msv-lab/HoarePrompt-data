Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i. The function returns the number of cycles in the permutation described by the list `p` for each test case.**
