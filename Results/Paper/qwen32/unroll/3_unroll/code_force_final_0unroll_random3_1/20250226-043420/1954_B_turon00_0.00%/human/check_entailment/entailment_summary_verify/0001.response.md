### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution in detail to determine if the solution is correct based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- An array is "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same using a specific operation.
- The operation allows choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. If it's impossible, return -1.

#### Provided Solution Recap:
1. **Input Reading**: The solution reads the number of test cases and for each, the length of the array and the array itself.
2. **Uniform Array Check**: If all elements in the array are the same, it outputs `-1` because such an array is already non-beautiful.
3. **Counting Consecutive Elements**: For non-uniform arrays, it calculates the length of the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and considers this as the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it determines the length of the shortest contiguous subarray in a list `a` that contains all elements equal to the first element of the list.
- If all elements in the list are the same, it outputs `-1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Uniform Array Check**: The solution correctly identifies that if all elements are the same, the array is already non-beautiful, and thus returns `-1`. This part is correct.
2. **Non-Uniform Array Handling**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence of identical elements minus one. This is not correct because the problem requires the array to be non-beautiful after operations, not just by removing elements from a sequence.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
- The longest sequence of identical elements is `1` and `2`, each of length 3.
- According to the solution, the answer would be `2` (removing 2 elements from the longest sequence).
- However, removing any one element from this array (e.g., the middle `2`), results in `[1, 2, 1, 1]`, which is still beautiful because you can perform operations to make all elements `1`.

This counterexample demonstrates that the solution is incorrect because it fails to account for the operations allowed and only considers the longest sequence of identical elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It fails to account for the operations allowed and only considers the longest sequence of identical elements.

**Final: False**
