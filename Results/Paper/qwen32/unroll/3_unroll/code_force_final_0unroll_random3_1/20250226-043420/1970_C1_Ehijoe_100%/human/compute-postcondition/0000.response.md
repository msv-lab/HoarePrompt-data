The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already specified to be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `t` is specified to be 1. The code does not change the value of `n` but assigns the value of `t` from the input, which is already known to be 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1.**
