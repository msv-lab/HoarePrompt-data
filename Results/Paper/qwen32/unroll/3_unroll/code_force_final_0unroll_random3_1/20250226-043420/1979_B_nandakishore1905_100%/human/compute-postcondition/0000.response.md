To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In the provided for loop:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head contains the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the upper bound of the range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state related to `int(input())` to ensure the loop can execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. If it is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
   - The loop will iterate `int(input())` times.

2. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `int(input())` is derived from the input function, we need to ensure that the input provided to the program is such that `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - Given the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, indicating that `t` is always greater than 0.
   - Therefore, the input to the loop should be `t`, which is already stated to be in the range 1 to 10^4.

### Conclusion:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input to `int(input())` is `t`, which is guaranteed to be greater than 0 based on the problem statement. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is not initialized yet and will be initialized by the loop**.

However, to strictly adhere to the format and only mention objects in the loop head, we can state it as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**.
