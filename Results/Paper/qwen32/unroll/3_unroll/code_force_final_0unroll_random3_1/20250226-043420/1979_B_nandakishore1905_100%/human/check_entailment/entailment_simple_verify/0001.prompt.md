You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the described problem.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of two infinite sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\), where:
- \(a_n = n \oplus x\)
- \(b_n = n \oplus y\)
- \(x\) and \(y\) are distinct non-negative integers.

### Key Insight:
The critical insight here is that the longest common subsegment between \(a\) and \(b\) corresponds to the longest sequence of consecutive integers \(n\) for which \(a_n = b_n\). This happens when:
\[ n \oplus x = n \oplus y \]
which simplifies to:
\[ x \oplus y = 0 \]
This is not possible since \(x\) and \(y\) are distinct. However, what we're looking for is the longest sequence where the pattern of XOR results repeats, which is determined by the highest power of 2 that divides \(|x - y|\).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) (which should be \(x\) and \(y\)). It calculates the absolute difference \(k = |n - m|\) and then determines the length of the longest common subsegment based on the properties of \(k\).

1. **If \(k\) is a power of 2**:
   - This is checked using the condition `k & (k - 1) == 0`. If true, the longest common subsegment length is \(k\).
2. **If \(k\) is odd**:
   - This is checked using the condition `k % 2 != 0`. If true, the longest common subsegment length is 1.
3. **If \(k\) is even but not a power of 2**:
   - The program finds the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\) by repeatedly subtracting the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) until the result is a power of 2. This is done using the loop:
     ```python
     while f & (f - 1) != 0:
         l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
         p = len(l)
         q = 2 ** (p - 1)
         f = f - q
     print(f)
     ```

### Correctness Check:
The logic of the program is correct based on the mathematical properties of XOR and the sequences described. The program correctly identifies the longest common subsegment length for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
