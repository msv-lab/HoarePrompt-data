Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 2 * 10^5; for each test case, `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `N`; the sum of all `N` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is 0.**

The variable `s` is assigned the value 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
