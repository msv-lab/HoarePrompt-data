The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array. Then, there is an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of queries, followed by q lines, each containing two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
