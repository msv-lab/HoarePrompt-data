To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in the given code is:

```python
for i in range(N + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is controlled by the `range(N + 1)` function. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 0, because `range(N + 1)` will generate at least one value (0) if `N` is 0 or more.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6
- `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5
- For each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `N`
- The sum of all `N` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- The sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional `-1` appended to it
- `s` is 0
- `e` is 0
- `num` is `nums[0]`
- `arr` is an empty list

The only variable that needs adjustment to ensure the loop executes is `N`. Since `N` is already defined to be in the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, it already guarantees that `N + 1` will be at least 3, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

Thus, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state remains as provided:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `N`; the sum of all `N` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional `-1` appended to it; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list**
