Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of `n` integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each integer in `a` is between 1 and 10^6. For each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` representing a range in the list `a`. The function returns the sum of the integers in the range from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) for each query.**
