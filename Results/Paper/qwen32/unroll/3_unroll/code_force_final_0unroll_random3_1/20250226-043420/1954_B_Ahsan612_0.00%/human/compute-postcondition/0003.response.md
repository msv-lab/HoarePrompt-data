Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements in the list `a`. If no such count can be determined (which should not happen given the problem constraints), it prints `-1`.**
