Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it non-beautiful. According to the problem, a beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements using the specified operation. To stop being beautiful, the array should not allow such a transformation.

The program's approach is to identify the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array. If the array consists of only one type of element throughout, it will be impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and the program should return `-1`. Otherwise, the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt the pattern of consecutive identical elements is the length of the shortest such sequence.

The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior: it iterates through the array, counts consecutive identical elements, and keeps track of the minimum count. If the array is uniform (the minimum count is `inf`), it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely uniform (all elements are the same). In such a case, `minn` will be set to the length of the entire array, not `inf`. Therefore, the condition `if minn == inf` will never be true, and the program will incorrectly output the length of the array instead of `-1`.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if all elements in the array are the same and output `-1` in that case.

Therefore, the current implementation is incorrect due to this oversight.

Correctness: **False**
