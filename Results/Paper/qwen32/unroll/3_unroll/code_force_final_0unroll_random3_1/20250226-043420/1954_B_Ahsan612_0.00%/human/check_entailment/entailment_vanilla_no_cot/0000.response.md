Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the code is flawed as it only checks for consecutive identical numbers and calculates the minimum length of such segments, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the minimum number of elements that, when removed, will break the "beautiful" property of the array. This involves checking for the longest contiguous subarray where the middle elements can be replaced by their neighbors and ensuring that removing elements from this subarray will result in an array that is no longer beautiful. The current implementation does not address this requirement.

A correct approach would involve identifying the longest segment where the condition for being beautiful holds and then determining the minimum number of elements to remove from that segment to disrupt the pattern.
