Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- **Beautiful Array**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.
- **Objective**: For a given beautiful array, determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it stop being beautiful. If it's impossible, output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case, processing an array `a` of `n` integers. It aims to find the minimum number of consecutive identical elements (`minn`) in the array. If such a count can be determined, it outputs `minn`; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

### Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: `same` is set to 1 to count consecutive identical elements, `num` stores the current number being counted, and `minn` is set to infinity to track the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.
2. **Iteration**: The program iterates through the array `ar` starting from the second element.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If not, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
3. **Final Update**: After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to account for the last sequence of identical elements.
4. **Output**: If `minn` is still infinity, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Logic Flaw**: The program's logic is flawed. The minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful is not simply the minimum count of consecutive identical elements. The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of removals required to break the "beautiful" property.
- **Example**: Consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program would output `1` (the minimum count of consecutive identical elements), but the correct answer is `3` (removing the first three `3`s to get `[5, 3, 3, 3]` which is not beautiful).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not properly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
