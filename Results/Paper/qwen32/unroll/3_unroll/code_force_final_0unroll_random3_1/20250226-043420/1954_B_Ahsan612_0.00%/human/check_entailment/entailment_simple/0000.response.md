### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. The logic of the program is based on finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array. If the entire array consists of the same element, the program correctly identifies that it's impossible to make it stop being beautiful by returning `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `same` to 1, which keeps track of the length of the current sequence of identical elements. It also initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found.

2. **Iteration**: The program iterates over the array starting from the second element. For each element:
   - If it is the same as the previous element (`num`), it increments `same`.
   - If it is different, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - It increments the index `i` by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Final Update**: After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with `same` to account for the last sequence of identical elements.

4. **Output**: If `minn` is still infinity (which would mean the array was empty, an edge case not mentioned in the problem constraints), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

### Issues:

The logic seems flawed because the program does not correctly handle cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing a single element, even if all elements are not identical. For example, in the second test case of the example input, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` can be made non-beautiful by removing a single element (e.g., the middle `1` or `2`), but the program will output `2` (the length of the longest sequence of identical elements), which is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve checking sequences of elements and determining the minimum number of removals required to break the "beautiful" property, which is more complex than simply finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
