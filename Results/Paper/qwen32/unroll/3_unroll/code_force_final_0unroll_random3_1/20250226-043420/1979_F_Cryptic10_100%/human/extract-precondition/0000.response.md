Precondition: **The function `func()` does not take any input arguments. The interaction is handled through standard input and output as described in the problem statement. For each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is provided, representing the number of vertices in the graph. The function must perform no more than n queries of the form "? d" to determine a Hamiltonian path in the graph. The interaction is non-adaptive, and the graph remains constant throughout the interaction.**
