### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and counting the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the remainders.
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`, it calculates:
     - `r_x = -num % x` which is the negative of `num` modulo `x`. This is used to find pairs where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` which is `num` modulo `y`. This is used to find pairs where `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to the `count`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program is correct based on the problem description. Here’s why:

- The program correctly calculates the remainders `r_x` and `r_y` for each element in the array.
- It uses a dictionary to efficiently count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
- The use of `residue_map` ensures that the program runs in linear time relative to the size of the array, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
