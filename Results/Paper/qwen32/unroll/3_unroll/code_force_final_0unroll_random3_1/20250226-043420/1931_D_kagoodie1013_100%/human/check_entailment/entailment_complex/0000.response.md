### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the execution states given as comments. The program is designed to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program uses a hashmap (`residue_map`) to store the counts of pairs of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) where:
- \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\)
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\)

For each element in the array, the program:
1. Computes \(r_x\) and \(r_y\).
2. Checks how many pairs \((r_x, r_y)\) have already been seen and adds this count to the total number of beautiful pairs.
3. Updates the hashmap to include the current element's residue pair.

The program processes each test case independently and returns the results for all test cases.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Correctness of the Residue Calculation**:
   - \(r_x = -num \% x\) ensures that we are considering the negative residue modulo \(x\). This is valid because \(-num \% x\) will always be in the range \([0, x-1]\).
   - \(r_y = num \% y\) is straightforward and gives the residue of \(num\) modulo \(y\).

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of valid pairs by checking how many times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before in the hashmap (`residue_map`).
   - It then updates the hashmap with the current element's residue pair.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program processes each test case independently and stores the results in a list.
   - It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results in the correct order.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program processes each element in the array once per test case, resulting in a time complexity of \(O(n)\) per test case, where \(n\) is the length of the array.
   - Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and feasible.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs for each test case as described in the problem statement. The provided explanation and the code logic align with the requirements, and there are no apparent issues in the implementation.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs for each test case by using a hashmap to store and count residue pairs. The residue calculations and the counting mechanism are correct and efficient given the problem constraints.
Correctness: **True**
