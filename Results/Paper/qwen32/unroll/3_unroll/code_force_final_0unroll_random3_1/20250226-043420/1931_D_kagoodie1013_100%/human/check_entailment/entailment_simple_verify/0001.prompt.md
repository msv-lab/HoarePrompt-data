You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair of indices `<i, j>` is considered beautiful if:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the frequency of pairs of residues `(num % x, num % y)` as it iterates through the array. The key idea is to use these residues to determine if a pair is beautiful.

1. **Residue Calculation:**
   - For each number `num` in the array, compute `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - The pair `(r_x, r_y)` is used to check how many previous numbers could form a beautiful pair with the current number based on the conditions provided.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each number, the solution checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the dictionary `residue_map`. If it does, it means there are previous numbers that can form a beautiful pair with the current number, and the count is incremented by the frequency of that pair.
   - After checking, the current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` is added to the dictionary, and its frequency is updated.

### Correctness Verification:
The provided solution is correct because:
- It correctly computes the residues required to check the conditions for a beautiful pair.
- It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to store and look up the frequencies of the residue pairs.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
- Beautiful pairs: `<1, 5>` and `<4, 6>`
- The solution correctly identifies these pairs and returns the count `2`.

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Thus, the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
