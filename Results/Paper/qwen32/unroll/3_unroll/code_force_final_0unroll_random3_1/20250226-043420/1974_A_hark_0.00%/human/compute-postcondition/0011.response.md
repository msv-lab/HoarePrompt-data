Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x <= 99` and `x > 0`.
- `y` is an integer such that `0 <= y <= 99` and `y = 0`.
- It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate `math.ceil(x / 15)`. The `math.ceil()` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.

Since `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive), let's analyze the possible values of `x / 15`:
- The smallest possible value of `x` is 1, so `1 / 15` is approximately 0.0667, and `math.ceil(0.0667)` is 1.
- The largest possible value of `x` is 99, so `99 / 15` is 6.6, and `math.ceil(6.6)` is 7.

Therefore, the value printed will be an integer between 1 and 7, inclusive, depending on the specific value of `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can't determine the exact printed value, but we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 99)**
