Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. If `x` equals 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.**
