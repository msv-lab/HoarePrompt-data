The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99) from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of the ceiling of `y / 2` and the ceiling of the adjusted `x` value divided by 15, adjusted by `y * 4`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.
