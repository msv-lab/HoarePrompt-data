The code snippet `nodes = defaultdict(list)` reassigns the `nodes` variable to a new `defaultdict` object where the default value for each key is an empty list. This means that if a key does not exist in the dictionary, accessing it will automatically create a new entry with an empty list as its value.

The other variables (`start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers and values are lists (defaulting to an empty list); `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**
