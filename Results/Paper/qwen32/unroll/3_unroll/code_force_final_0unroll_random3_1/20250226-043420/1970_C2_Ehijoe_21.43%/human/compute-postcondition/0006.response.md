The code snippet initializes a deque named `leaves`. This does not affect the values of any other variables listed in the initial state. The other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers from 1 to n representing nodes, and values are lists containing the neighboring nodes connected by edges; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is an empty deque.**
