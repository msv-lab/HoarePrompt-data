Output State: **For each test case, the program will output 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. If 'YES' is output, it will also specify the number of operations (1 or 2) and the resulting string(s). The variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` will be in their final states after processing all test cases, but their exact values are not specified as they are local to each iteration. The global state outside the loop remains unchanged.**
