You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):

        n = len(s)
        done = False
        if n == 1:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if it is possible to make the string non-palindromic by removing at most two characters. If it is possible, the function outputs 'YES' followed by the number of characters removed (either 1 or 2) and the resulting string(s). If it is not possible, the function outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Single Character Strings**:
    - The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings and outputs "NO" for such cases.
    - This is handled by the condition `if n == 1: print('NO')`.

2. **Strings with Different First and Last Characters**:
    - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the entire string is a valid partition as it is not a palindrome.
    - This is handled by the condition `if x != s[-1]: print('YES')`.

3. **Strings with All Characters Identical**:
    - If all characters in the string are the same, no valid partition exists since any substring will be a palindrome.
    - This is handled by the condition `if s.count(x) == n: print('NO')`.

4. **Strings with All but One Character Identical**:
    - If all characters except one are the same, the program checks if the middle character (for odd-length strings) is different from the others.
    - If the middle character is different, no valid partition exists.
    - This is handled by the condition `if s.count(x) == n - 1: if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x: print('NO')`.

5. **General Case**:
    - The program then iterates through the string to find a valid partition.
    - It looks for the first non-palindromic substring by checking if characters at mirrored positions from the start and end are different.
    - If such a pair is found, it outputs the entire string as a valid partition.
    - If no such pair is found, it looks for a point where the character changes and tries to split the string into two non-palindromic substrings.
    - This is handled by the loop and conditions within the `for` loop.

6. **Edge Cases**:
    - The program handles a variety of edge cases, such as strings with repeated characters and strings that are already non-palindromes.
    - It ensures that the output format is correct and adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and edge cases as described by the problem statement. It efficiently checks for valid partitions and outputs the correct results based on the input conditions.
