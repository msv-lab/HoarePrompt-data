Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description and the given execution states. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Default Value Function**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with a function `default_value` which is not defined anywhere in the given code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic to calculate the number of additional problems needed is incorrect. The current logic checks if the count of any difficulty level is less than or equal to `m` and adds the difference to the answer. This means it will overcount the number of problems needed because it doesn't account for the fact that each round needs one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Instead, it should check how many problems of each type are needed for `m` rounds and sum up the deficits.

3. **Output**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called, and it simply returns 0, which is incorrect as it should return the computed answer for each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def default_value():
    return 0

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    required_difficulties = set('ABCDEFG')
    for difficulty in required_difficulties:
        if d[difficulty] < m:
            ans += m - d[difficulty]
    print(ans)
```

In this corrected version:
- The `default_value` function is defined to return 0, which is used to initialize the `defaultdict`.
- The program correctly checks how many problems of each required difficulty ('A' to 'G') are needed for `m` rounds and sums up the deficits.
- The function `func_1` is removed as it was not used and incorrect.

Given the issues in the original code, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
