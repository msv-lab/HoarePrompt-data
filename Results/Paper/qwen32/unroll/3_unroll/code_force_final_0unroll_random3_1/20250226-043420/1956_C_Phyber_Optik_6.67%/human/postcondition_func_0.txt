The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific sum and a sequence of operations involving the matrix size. The sum is derived based on a conditional logic related to the matrix size, and the sequence of operations involves printing indices and ranges up to `n + r`, where `r` is determined during the calculation. The function outputs the calculated sum and the sequence of operations for each test case.
