### Reasoning:

The given problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing a series of operations, each of which can either permute a row or a column. The key insight here is that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers from 1 to \( n \) in a way that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix.

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly achieves this:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the matrix elements.
   - It iterates from 1 to \( n \) and adds \( n \times (n + 1) / 2 \) to the sum if \( n \times (n + 1) / 2 > i \times n \). Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \).
   - This logic is intended to ensure that the sum is maximized. However, it seems to be incorrectly implemented. The sum should simply be \( n^2 \times (n + 1) / 2 \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times in the matrix.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints a sequence of operations to achieve the matrix configuration that maximizes the sum.
   - It prints operations of type 1 (row permutation) and type 2 (column permutation).
   - The operations are intended to fill the matrix with numbers from 1 to \( n \) in a way that each number appears exactly \( n \) times.

### Issues:
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The correct sum should be the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times, which is \( n^2 \times (n + 1) / 2 \).
- **Operations**: The operations printed by the program are not necessarily incorrect, but the sum calculation is incorrect, which makes the entire output incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the sum calculation, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
