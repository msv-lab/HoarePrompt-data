Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` matrix. For each test case, the function is expected to perform some operation (not detailed here) and return a result based on the matrix size. The total number of test cases is between 1 and 500, and the sum of the squares of all matrix sizes does not exceed 5 * 10^5.**
