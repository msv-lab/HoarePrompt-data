Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and does not generate a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The program attempts to calculate the sum based on a condition that doesn't make sense in the context of maximizing the sum of a matrix filled with permutations.
   - The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each row and each column is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). This is because each row and each column will sum to \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and there are \( n \) rows (or columns).

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations**:
   - The number of operations \( n + r \) is not correctly determined. The program attempts to use a variable \( r \) that is not properly defined or used.
   - The correct number of operations should be \( 2n \) as per the problem statement, where we can perform one type 1 operation on each row and one type 2 operation on each column.

3. **Incorrect Operations**:
   - The operations generated by the program do not ensure that each row and each column is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The operations should be carefully chosen to ensure that the matrix is filled with permutations such that the sum is maximized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates \( 2n \) operations to ensure that each row and each column is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
