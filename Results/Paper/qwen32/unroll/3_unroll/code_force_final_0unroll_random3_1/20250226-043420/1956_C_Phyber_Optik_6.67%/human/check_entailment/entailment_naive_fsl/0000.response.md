Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and the required operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum of the matrix by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each row until a certain condition is met, and then adds `i * n` for the remaining rows. This logic is incorrect.
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], and each column with the same permutation. This means the sum of each row and each column will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Therefore, the total sum should be `n * n * (n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program generates operations that do not necessarily maximize the sum. It prints `n + r` operations, where `r` is calculated based on some condition. These operations do not guarantee that each row and column is filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], which is required to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The operations printed by the program do not follow the correct format. For example, the program prints `1 j` and then the permutation, but the format should be `1 i p1 p2 ... pn` for row operations and `2 i p1 p2 ... pn` for column operations.

To fix the program, the following changes are necessary:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Calculate the sum as `n * n * (n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Operations**:
   - Perform `n` type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].
   - Perform `n` type 2 operations to fill each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the maximum sum is achieved and the operations are correctly formatted.
