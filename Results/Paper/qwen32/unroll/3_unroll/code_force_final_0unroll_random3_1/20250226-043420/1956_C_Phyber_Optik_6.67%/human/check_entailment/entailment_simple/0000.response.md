Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the maximum sum for an n x n matrix using the operations described. However, there are several issues with the logic and the implementation of the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**: The program calculates the sum based on a flawed logic. The maximum sum that can be achieved in the matrix is simply `n*n*n` because each cell in the matrix can be filled with the maximum value `n` (since permutations will use numbers from 1 to n). The current logic in the program does not correctly calculate this.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Operations**: The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is determined based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. This logic is not aligned with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum with no more than `2n` operations. The operations should be designed to fill the matrix with the maximum possible values, which can be achieved by simply filling each row or column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Incorrect Output of Operations**: The program outputs operations in a way that does not guarantee the maximum sum. For example, the operations for columns are outputted with `j % n`, which can lead to incorrect column indices and does not ensure that the maximum values are placed in the matrix.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Calculate the maximum sum as `n*n*n`.
- Perform exactly `n` operations, each filling a row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- Output these operations correctly.

Given the issues identified, the program as provided is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
