Let's analyze the given program and its logic to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` based on the formula:
     \[
     s = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \min\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}, i \cdot n\right)
     \]
   - This logic seems to be incorrect because it does not properly maximize the sum. The maximum sum should be `n * n * n` (i.e., filling each cell with `n`), which can be achieved by using permutations that fill each row and each column with the numbers `1` to `n`.

2. **Operation Sequence:**
   - The program generates a sequence of operations where it fills the first `n` rows with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For the remaining operations (up to `n + r`), it fills columns in a similar manner.
   - This logic also seems flawed as it doesn't ensure that the entire matrix is filled optimally to maximize the sum.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. The maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with the numbers `1` to `n` in each row and column is `n * n * n`. The program's logic for determining the sum and generating operations does not achieve this.

### Correct Solution:
To achieve the maximum sum, we can perform `n` Type 1 operations (fill each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`). This will fill the matrix with the numbers `1` to `n` in each row, and the sum will be `n * n * n`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
