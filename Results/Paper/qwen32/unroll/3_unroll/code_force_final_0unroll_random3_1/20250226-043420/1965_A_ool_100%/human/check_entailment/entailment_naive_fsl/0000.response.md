Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not accurately simulate the game rules.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
In this case, Alice can choose `k=2` on her first turn, which will empty all piles, making Bob unable to make a move. Therefore, Alice wins.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
Bob
```

**Explanation of Why the Program Fails:**
The program checks if the smallest pile is not 1 and if the differences between consecutive sorted unique pile sizes are not greater than 1. However, this logic does not correctly simulate the game rules and does not account for the optimal moves that both players would make. 

For example, in the test case mentioned above, the program incorrectly determines that Bob wins because it does not correctly simulate the game's mechanics and the players' optimal strategies.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
