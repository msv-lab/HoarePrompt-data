### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same:**
   - The program initializes a `flag` to `True`.
   - It then iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the loop.

3. **Finding the Shortest Sequence of Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `val` to the first element of the array, and `cnt` to `0`.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `val`. When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, then resets `cnt` and updates `val`.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` with the last `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `flag` is `True` (meaning all elements were the same), the program outputs `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `ans`, which is the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same before a different element is encountered.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness for All Elements the Same:** The program correctly identifies when all elements in the array are the same and outputs `-1`. This is handled by the `flag` variable.
  
- **Finding the Shortest Sequence:** The logic to find the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same before a different element is encountered is correct. By iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive elements, the program correctly determines the minimum length of such sequences.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as arrays of length `1` and arrays where all elements are the same.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make a beautiful array non-beautiful. It handles all specified edge cases and adheres to the problem requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
