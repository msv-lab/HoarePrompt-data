Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in handling the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Here's an example where the code does not work as expected:

Consider the test case:
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
The expected output is `2`, because by removing two elements (e.g., the first and the last), the array becomes `[2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the given program will output `1`, which is incorrect.

Let's analyze the code:
1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
2. If not all elements are the same, it tries to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray that consists of the same element. It does this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive elements that are the same.
3. The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum count of such contiguous subarrays.
4. Finally, it prints `ans` as the result.

The problem with this approach is that it doesn't correctly account for the necessary removal of elements to break the "beautiful" property. It only considers contiguous subarrays of the same element but does not consider the overall structure of the array and the effect of removing elements on the "beautiful" property.

For example, in the test case `1 2 1 2 1 2`, the program will find the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of the same element, which is `1`, but removing just one element won't make the array non-beautiful. It needs to remove at least two elements to break the alternating pattern.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
