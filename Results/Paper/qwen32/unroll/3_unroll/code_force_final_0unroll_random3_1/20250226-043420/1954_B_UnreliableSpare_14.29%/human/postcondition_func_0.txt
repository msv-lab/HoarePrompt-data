The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It determines if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements in `arr` that are the same before a different element is encountered.
