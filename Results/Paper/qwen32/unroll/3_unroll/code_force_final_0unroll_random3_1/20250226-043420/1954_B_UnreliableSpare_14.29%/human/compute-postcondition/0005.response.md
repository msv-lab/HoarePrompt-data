The given code snippet assigns the value `Decimal('Infinity')` to the variable `ans`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity').**
