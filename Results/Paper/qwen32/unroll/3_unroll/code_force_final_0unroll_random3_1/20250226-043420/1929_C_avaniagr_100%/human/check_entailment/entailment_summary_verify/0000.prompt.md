You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition involving `k`, `x`, and `a` is met and prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied or 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to identify any potential issues.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem describes a scenario where Sasha can place bets in a casino under certain rules. The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee having any number of coins, \( n \), given the parameters \( k \) (multiplier for winning), \( x \) (maximum number of consecutive losses), and \( a \) (initial number of coins).

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
- Sasha can place a bet of \( y \) coins where \( y \) is a positive integer and \( y \leq a \).
- Upon winning, Sasha gains \( y \cdot (k - 1) \) coins.
- Upon losing, Sasha loses \( y \) coins.
- Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
- The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee having any number of coins \( n \) for any possible outcome that follows the rules.

### Code Analysis:
The code provided attempts to determine if Sasha can guarantee having any number of coins based on the given conditions. However, there are some logical issues in the code that could lead to incorrect results.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Logic for \( x < k - 1 \) and \( x == k - 1 \)**:
   - For \( x < k - 1 \), the code checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \).
   - For \( x == k - 1 \), the code checks if \( a \geq x + 2 \).
   - These conditions seem reasonable, but the logic needs to be thoroughly verified for all edge cases.

2. **Logic for \( x > k - 1 \)**:
   - The code calculates a value \( z \) iteratively based on the formula \( z = z // (k - 1) + 1 \).
   - This logic is more complex and might not correctly handle all scenarios, especially for larger values of \( x \) and \( k \).

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to see if the code fails for any specific input.

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
- For \( k = 3 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( a = 3 \):
  - Sasha can place a bet of 1 coin.
  - If he wins, he will have 4 coins.
  - If he loses, he will have 2 coins.
  - If he loses again, he will have 1 coin.
  - With 1 coin, he can place a bet of 1 coin again.
  - If he wins, he will have 3 coins.
  - If he loses, he will have 0 coins, which is not allowed as the bet amount must be positive.
  - Therefore, Sasha cannot guarantee having any number of coins.

**Actual Output from the Code:**
- The code will output "YES" for this input, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly, and there are scenarios where the code outputs "YES" when it should output "NO". Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
