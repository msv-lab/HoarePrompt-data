Let's analyze the given Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided description.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires finding all possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling, the conditions of the settling process are met. The settling process repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and within each cycle, the numbers assigned follow a specific pattern.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `x`.

2. **Logic for Finding `k`:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - If either of these conditions is true, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate value (`n + x - 2` or `n - x`).
   
3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number `x` and returns them in ascending order.
   - It iterates through numbers from `1` to the square root of `x`, checking for divisors and adding both the divisor and its complement to the list of divisors.

4. **Checking Divisors:**
   - For each divisor `s` returned by `func_1`, the program checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are met, `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the list of possible `k` values.
   - The list of possible `k` values is then converted to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.

5. **Output:**
   - The length of the final list of possible `k` values is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the conditions under which `k` can be valid based on the given problem description.
- It correctly calculates the divisors of the necessary values using `func_1`.
- It checks the necessary conditions for each divisor to determine if it corresponds to a valid `k`.
- The final output is the correct count of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
