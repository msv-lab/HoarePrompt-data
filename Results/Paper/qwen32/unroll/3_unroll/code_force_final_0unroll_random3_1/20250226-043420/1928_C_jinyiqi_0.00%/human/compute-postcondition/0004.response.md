The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The elements of `output1` are the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`. By reversing this list, the order of these divisors is flipped.

The values of `x`, `n`, `output2`, and the precondition that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9` remain unchanged. The only change is in the order of the elements in `output1`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order; `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
