Reasoning:

1. The program's logic seems to be trying to find all possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints for each test case. However, there are a few issues and missing parts in the provided code that need to be addressed.

2. The function `func_1(x)` is supposed to return all divisors of `x`, but the implementation is incorrect. It reverses `output1` and appends it to `output2` in reverse order, which results in duplicates and incorrect order. Instead, it should just append both `i` and `x/i` to a single list without reversing.

3. The main logic of the program is based on the condition that `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`. These conditions are related to the pattern of the sequence, but the logic for determining `k` is incomplete and incorrect.

4. The program does not correctly calculate the values of `k` that fit the pattern. The formula `(s + 2) / 2` is used to calculate `k`, but it does not correctly account for the pattern of the sequence.

5. The program does not handle the case where `(n + x - 2) % 2 != 0` and `(n - x) % 2 != 0`, which should result in `k` not being possible.

6. The program does not print the output for each test case, which is required by the problem statement.

7. The program does not handle the case where `k = 1`, which is not valid according to the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not provide the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
