Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it counts the elements that are less than or equal to `k` in both arrays. The program only checks the first `max(len_a, len_b)` elements of each array, which is incorrect. It should be checking all elements in both arrays. Additionally, it does not ensure that the chosen elements from both arrays together cover all integers from 1 to `k`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = k // 2
        
        # Use sets to store unique elements <= k
        set_a = {x for x in a if x <= k}
        set_b = {x for x in b if x <= k}
        
        # Check if we can pick d elements from each set
        if len(set_a) >= d and len(set_b) >= d:
            # Check if the union of both sets contains all numbers from 1 to k
            if set_a.union(set_b) == set(range(1, k + 1)):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version uses sets to store unique elements from each array that are less than or equal to `k`. It then checks if the union of these sets contains all integers from 1 to `k`.
