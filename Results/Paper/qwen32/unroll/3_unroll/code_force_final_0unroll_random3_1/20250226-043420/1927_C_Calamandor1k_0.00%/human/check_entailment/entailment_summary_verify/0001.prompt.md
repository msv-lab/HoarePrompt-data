You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (len_a, len_b) = (len(a), len(b))
        (count_a, count_b) = (0, 0)
        d = k // 2
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integer arrays `a` and `b`, and an even integer `k`. For each test case, it checks if at least half of the first `k` elements in both arrays `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. It then prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting how many elements in each array `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that we can select exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included among the chosen elements.

The program iterates through the indices of the longer array and counts elements that are less than or equal to `k` in both arrays. However, it does not check for the requirement that the selected elements must cover all integers from 1 to `k`. It simply checks if there are at least `k/2` elements in each array that are less than or equal to `k`, which is not sufficient.

For example, consider the case where `k=6` and the arrays are `a=[7, 8, 9]` and `b=[1, 2, 3]`. The program would count 0 elements in `a` and 3 elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and thus output "YES", which is incorrect because it is not possible to select 3 elements from `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to 6 are included.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if we can select `k/2` elements from `a` and `k/2` elements from `b` such that together they cover all integers from 1 to `k`. This requires checking the availability of each number from 1 to `k` in the combined selection of `k/2` elements from each array.
