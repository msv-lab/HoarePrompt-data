Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is currently executing the block of code under the if condition `if (__name__ == '__main__')`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` has been updated to an integer input by the user, while all other variables and conditions remain as specified in the initial state.
