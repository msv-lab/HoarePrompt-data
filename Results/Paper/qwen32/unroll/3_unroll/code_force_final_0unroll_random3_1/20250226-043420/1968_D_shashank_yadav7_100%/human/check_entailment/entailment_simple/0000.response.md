### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described by simulating the game for each test case and calculating the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` (Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1 from each.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - It initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions.
   - It also initializes the maximum scores (`bm` for Bodya and `sm` for Sasha) to the scores they get from staying in their starting positions for `k` turns.

4. **Simulating the Game:**
   - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns.
   - In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible scores for both players by considering the score they would get if they stayed in their new positions for the remaining turns.
   - It also updates the cumulative scores for both players.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After simulating the game, the program compares the maximum possible scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue in the program is that it only simulates the game for `k` turns but does not correctly handle the case where players can stay in their positions or move to new positions optimally. The program assumes that players will always move to new positions, which is not necessarily optimal.

For example, consider a case where staying in the current position yields a higher score than moving to the new position. The current implementation does not account for this possibility.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle the optimal decision-making process for both players at each turn, considering both staying and moving options.
