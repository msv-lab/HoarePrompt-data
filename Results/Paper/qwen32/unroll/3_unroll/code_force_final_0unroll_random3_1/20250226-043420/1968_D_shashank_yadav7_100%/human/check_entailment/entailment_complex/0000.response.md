### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores after `k` turns. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a permutation `p`, an array `a`, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly implements the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The positions `P_B` and `P_S` are decremented by 1 to convert from 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing, which is typical in Python.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` for Sasha and Bodya are set to `a[P_S]` and `a[P_B]`, respectively.
   - The maximum scores `sm` and `bm` for Sasha and Bodya are initialized to `a[P_S] * k` and `a[P_B] * k`, respectively. This is a critical step that assumes the players will always stay in their current positions, which is not necessarily the best strategy.

4. **Simulating Moves:**
   - The program iterates up to `k` times, simulating each turn.
   - In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the scores `bp` and `sp` by adding the values from the array `a` at the new positions.
   - It also updates the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` by considering the current score plus the remaining turns multiplied by the current position value. This step attempts to account for the best possible score if the player stays in the current position for the remaining turns.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After simulating the moves, the program compares the maximum scores `bm` and `sm`.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues in the Program:

The critical issue with the program lies in the assumption that the players will always stay in their current positions for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily the best strategy. The players can choose to move to the next position in the permutation, which might yield a higher score. The current implementation does not explore all possible paths or strategies for the players, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
