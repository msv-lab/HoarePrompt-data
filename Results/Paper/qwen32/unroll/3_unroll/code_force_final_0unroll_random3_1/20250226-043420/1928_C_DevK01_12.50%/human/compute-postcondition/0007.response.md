Output State: **The program returns a list `M` that contains the integer square root `w` of `q` if `w >= x - 1`, and all divisors of `q` along with their corresponding quotients that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list that includes the integer square root of `q` if it meets a certain condition, and also includes pairs of divisors of `q` and their corresponding quotients that are at least `x - 1`.
