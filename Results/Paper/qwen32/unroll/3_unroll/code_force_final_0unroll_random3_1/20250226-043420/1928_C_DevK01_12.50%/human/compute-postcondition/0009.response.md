Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `q` (an integer) and `x` (an integer). It calculates the integer square root `w` of `q` and checks if `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If true, `w` is added to a list `M`. The function then finds all divisors of `q` and their corresponding quotients that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and adds them to `M`. Finally, the function returns the list `M`.**
