### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the number of possible values of `k` such that, given a position `n` and a number `x` that Vasya received, the conditions of the "first-k-th" position settling are satisfied. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and the numbers assigned in the pattern are `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2`.

#### Key Points
1. **Pattern Repetition**: The pattern of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. **Constraints**: `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.
3. **Output**: The number of different `k` that fit the given constraints.

#### Code Analysis

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n` and `x` are read.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the output is `0` because it's impossible to fit the pattern with odd `y`.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - The function `func_1` is called twice:
     - Once with `((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
     - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it is called again with `((n - x) // 2, x)`.
   - The function `func_1` finds divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The results from the two calls to `func_1` are combined and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - The length of the resulting set is printed as the answer.

### Function `func_1` Analysis
- This function calculates divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- It also checks all integers from `1` to `floor(sqrt(q))` to see if they are divisors and if their corresponding quotients are also divisors.

#### Correctness Analysis

The logic of the code seems to be based on the idea that `k` must be such that `x` appears at position `n` in the repeating pattern of length `2k - 2`. The function `func_1` is supposed to find possible values of `k` by checking divisors of certain expressions derived from `n` and `x`.

However, the approach taken in the code is not entirely clear and does not directly map to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the way `k` is derived from `n` and `x` using `y = n + x` and the subsequent divisor checks does not seem to directly correspond to the pattern described in the problem.

Let's consider the correct approach:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given `k`, the position `n` can be mapped to a position within one cycle of the pattern.
   - The position within the cycle can be calculated as `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) + 1`.
   - This position should correspond to `x` in the pattern `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2`.

2. **Finding Valid `k`**:
   - For each `k`, check if the position within the cycle matches `x`.
   - The position within the cycle should be either `x` or `2k - x` (for the descending part of the pattern).

The provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it relies on divisor checks which do not directly map to the problem's requirements.

#### Conclusion

Given the complexity and the specific requirements of the problem, the provided code does not seem to correctly implement the solution for all possible cases. The approach taken in the code does not directly map to the problem's requirements and might not handle all edge cases correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

### Final: **False**
