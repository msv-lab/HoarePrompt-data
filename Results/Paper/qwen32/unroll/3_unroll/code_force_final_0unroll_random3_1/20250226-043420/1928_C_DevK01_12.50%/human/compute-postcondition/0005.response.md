To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `w`.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the `range` function must generate at least one value. This happens if the start value (1) is less than the end value (`int(w // 1)`). Therefore, `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition for `w`:** 
   - `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer.
   - `w` must satisfy the condition `w >= x - 1` for `M` to be `[w]`; otherwise, `M` is `[]`.
   - Since `w` is an integer, `w // 1` is simply `w`.

2. **Condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(w // 1) > 1`, which simplifies to `w > 1` because `w` is already an integer.

Given the above, the only state that needs adjustment in the context of the loop head is `w`. Specifically, `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Since the state `q` is given as an integer such that `1 <= q <= 100` and `w` is the integer square root of `q`, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 1. The smallest integer `w` that satisfies this condition is 2, which corresponds to `q` being at least 4 (since `sqrt(4) = 2`).

Thus, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`q` is an integer such that `q >= 4`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `M` is a list containing the single element `w` if `w >= x - 1`, otherwise `M` is an empty list**. 

However, focusing only on the loop head variables `i` and `w`, the state adjustment is:
State: **`w` is an integer greater than 1**.
