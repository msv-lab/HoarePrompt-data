Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `q` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `x` (an integer). For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `x` where `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`. The function returns a list `M` that contains the integer square root `w` of `n` if `w >= x - 1`, and all divisors of `n` along with their corresponding quotients that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
