To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `left <= right` is satisfied right before the loop starts. 

Given the state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is `n - 1`.

The condition `left <= right` must be true for the loop to execute. Given that `left` is initialized to 0 and `right` is initialized to `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 (as specified in the problem statement), which guarantees that `right` (which is `n - 1`) is at least 1. Therefore, `left` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `right` (which is at least 1).

Since `n` is already constrained to be at least 2, no further adjustments are needed to the state of `left` or `right` to ensure the loop can execute.

Thus, the state remains the same:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`.**
