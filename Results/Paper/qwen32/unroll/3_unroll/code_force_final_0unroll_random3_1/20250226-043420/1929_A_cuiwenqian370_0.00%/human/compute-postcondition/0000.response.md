Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and arr is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

Natural language: The variable `t` remains unchanged. For each test case, `n` remains the same, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
