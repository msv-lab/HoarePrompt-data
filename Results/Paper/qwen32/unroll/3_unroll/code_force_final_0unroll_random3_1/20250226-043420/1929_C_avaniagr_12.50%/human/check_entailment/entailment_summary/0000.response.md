### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used in the code and compare it with the problem's requirements. The problem essentially asks whether Sasha can guarantee that he can reach any number of coins `n` given the casino rules.

Let's break down the logic in the code:

1. **For `x < k - 1`:**
   - The code checks if `a` (initial coins) is at least `x + 1`.
   - If `a >= x + 1`, it prints 'YES', meaning Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

2. **For `x == k - 1`:**
   - The code checks if `a` is at least `x + 3`.
   - If `a >= x + 3`, it prints 'YES', meaning Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **For `x > k - 1`:**
   - The code calculates a threshold `z` using a loop:
     - It initializes `z` to 0.
     - For `i` from 0 to `x`, it updates `z` using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - If `a` is at least `z`, it prints 'YES', meaning Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Let's verify if these conditions are correct based on the problem description:

- **For `x < k - 1`:**
  - The logic seems correct. If `a >= x + 1`, Sasha can use a strategy where he bets 1 coin if he won the previous bet or if it's the first bet. If he loses, he bets 2 coins, and so on. This ensures that even with `x` consecutive losses, he can still recover and continue betting.
  
- **For `x == k - 1`:**
  - The logic seems correct. The additional 2 coins in the threshold (`x + 3` instead of `x + 1`) account for the need to recover from the maximum consecutive losses (`k - 1`), ensuring Sasha can still guarantee reaching any number of coins.
  
- **For `x > k - 1`:**
  - The logic seems correct. The loop calculates the threshold `z` based on the cumulative effect of betting and losing up to `x` times in a row. The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` ensures that the threshold is calculated correctly to account for the potential losses and recoveries.

Given the above analysis, the logic in the code appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem's requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
