Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the maximum number of elements in the list `a` from index `0` to `k-2` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`, considering possible swaps, without modifying the input values. The function does not return any value.**
