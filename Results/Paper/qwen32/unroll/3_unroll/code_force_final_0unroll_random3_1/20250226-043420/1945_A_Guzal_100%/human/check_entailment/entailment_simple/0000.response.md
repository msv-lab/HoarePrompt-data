### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or returns `-1` if it's impossible.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts (a):** Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
3. **Universals (c):** Universals can be in a tent by themselves, with one other person, or with two others.

The goal is to find the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

#### Conditions:
- If the number of extroverts `b` is not divisible by 3, and the remaining participants (universals `c`) cannot fill the remaining spots in the last tent, it's impossible to accommodate everyone, and the function should return `-1`.
- Otherwise, calculate the number of tents required:
  - Each introvert needs one tent.
  - Each group of three participants (two extroverts and one universal, or three universals) needs one tent.
  - If there are leftover participants after forming groups of three, they will need an additional tent.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then loops through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The code checks if `b % 3 != 0` (i.e., the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3) and if `b % 3 + c < 3` (i.e., the remaining universals cannot fill the last tent). If both conditions are true, it prints `-1`.
   - This correctly identifies impossible scenarios.

3. **Tent Calculation:**
   - If the conditions for impossibility are not met, it calculates the total number of tents `k` as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
   - This accounts for the tents required for introverts and the groups of three participants.
   - If there are leftover participants after forming groups of three (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), it adds one more tent.

4. **Output:**
   - The code prints the calculated number of tents for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required or identify impossible scenarios. It handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
