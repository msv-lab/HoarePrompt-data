Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates and prints a value `k` based on the conditions involving `b` and `c`. Specifically, if `b` modulo 3 is not zero and `b + c` is less than 3, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3, and if `b + c` modulo 3 is not zero, it increments `k` by 1. Finally, it prints the value of `k` for each test case.**
