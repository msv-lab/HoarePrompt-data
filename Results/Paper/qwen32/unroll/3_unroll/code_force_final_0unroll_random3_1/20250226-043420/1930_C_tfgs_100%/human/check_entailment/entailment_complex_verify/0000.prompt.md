You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. We have an array `a` of length `n`.
2. We also have an empty set `S`.
3. We perform the following operations exactly `n` times:
   - Select an index `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ |a|`.
   - Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
   - Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
4. After all operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain unique values.
5. Construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.
6. Find the lexicographically largest `b` that can be made.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It adds `i + 1` to each element `a[i]` and stores the result in `a`.
4. It uses a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each unique value in `a`.
5. It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in decreasing order.
6. It constructs the array `b` by appending values from the sorted set and handling duplicate values based on the counter.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Duplicates**: The program correctly handles duplicates by using a `Counter` and ensures that the final array `b` includes each unique value the correct number of times.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the unique values in decreasing order, which is correct.
3. **Lexicographical Order**: The program ensures that the final array `b` is constructed in a way that maximizes its lexicographical order.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some edge cases.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `2 2 1`
   - Output: `3 2`
   - Explanation: Correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `5 1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000`
   - Output: `1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2`
   - Explanation: Correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `3 6 4 8`
   - Output: `11 7 6`
   - Explanation: Correct as per the problem statement.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Element**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Correct as `1 + 1 = 2` and `b = [2]`.

2. **All Elements Same**:
   - Input: `3 1 1 1`
   - Output: `4 3 2`
   - Explanation: Correct as `1 + 1 = 2`, `1 + 2 = 3`, `1 + 3 = 4` and `b = [4, 3, 2]`.

3. **All Elements Different**:
   - Input: `3 1 2 3`
   - Output: `5 4 3`
   - Explanation: Correct as `1 + 1 = 2`, `2 + 2 = 4`, `3 + 3 = 6` and `b = [6, 4, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with the provided examples and edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. The program handles duplicates, sorts the values in decreasing order, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
