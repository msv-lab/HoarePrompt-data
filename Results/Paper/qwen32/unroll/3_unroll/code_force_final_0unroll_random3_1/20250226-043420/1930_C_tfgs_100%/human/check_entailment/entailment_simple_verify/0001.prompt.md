You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding

1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we have an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`.
   
2. **Process:**
   - Perform the following operation `n` times:
     1. Select an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|).
     2. Insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S` (note that `S` only contains unique elements).
     3. Remove `a[i]` from `a`, shifting the indices of elements to the right of `a[i]` by 1.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
   
3. **Output:**
   - Construct a new array `b` which is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.
   - Find the lexicographically largest `b` possible.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

#### Key Steps in the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`.
   - It creates a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in decreasing order.
   - It calculates the number of elements that were removed due to being duplicates (`cnt`).
   - It constructs the array `ans` by iterating through the sorted unique elements of `a`:
     - If the current element is not the first one, it appends additional elements to `ans` to account for the duplicates and to maximize the lexicographical order.
     - It appends the current element to `ans` and updates the `Counter` and `cur` (current count of duplicates).
   - After the loop, if there are still elements to be added (`cnt` > 0), it appends the last element of `ans` minus 1 for each remaining count.
   - Finally, it prints the array `ans`.

#### Correctness Check

1. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program correctly uses a `Counter` to handle duplicates and ensures that the final array `b` is constructed by considering the unique elements in decreasing order.

3. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique elements and appends additional elements to maximize the lexicographical order by considering the duplicates.
   - It handles the remaining duplicates after the loop by appending the last element of `ans` minus 1 for each remaining count.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, which should be the lexicographically largest `b` possible.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem. It handles the modification of the array, manages duplicates, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
