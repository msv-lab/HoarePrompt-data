### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Modification of Array `a`:** For each element in the array `a`, it adds the index (1-based) to the element and stores the result back in `a`.
2. **Counting Unique Elements:** It uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each modified element in `a`.
3. **Sorting and Constructing `b`:** It creates a list `a` of unique elements sorted in descending order. It then constructs the final list `ans` by adding elements from the sorted list and filling gaps between them with the largest possible values that are not already in the set `S`.
4. **Handling Duplicates:** It ensures that the final list `ans` is the lexicographically largest possible by considering the counts of each element and filling in the gaps appropriately.

The program appears to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

- **Modification of Array `a`:** The loop `for i in range(n): a[i] += i + 1` correctly modifies each element in the array `a` as per the problem statement.
- **Counting Unique Elements:** The `Counter` object `counter` keeps track of the frequency of each modified element.
- **Sorting and Constructing `b`:** The list `a` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted in descending order. The construction of `ans` involves iterating over the sorted unique elements and filling in the gaps with the largest possible values.
- **Handling Duplicates:** The variable `cur` keeps track of the remaining count of elements in `counter` that have not been fully used, and `cnt` keeps track of the remaining count of elements that could have been inserted between the elements of `a`. The final loop `for _ in range(cnt): ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` ensures that the final list `ans` is complete.

Given the provided example inputs and outputs, the program seems to produce the correct results. The logic and the implementation match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
