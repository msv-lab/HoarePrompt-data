Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to perform a series of operations on an array `a` to construct a set `S`. The operations involve:
1. Selecting an index `i` and inserting `a[i] + i` into `S` (if it's not already in `S`).
2. Deleting `a[i]` from `a` (which shifts all elements to the right of `a[i]` one position to the left).

After performing `n` such operations, the array `a` will be empty, and the set `S` will contain unique values. The task is to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` from the sorted set `S` in decreasing order.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Modifying the Array:**
   - The program modifies the array `a` by adding the index `i + 1` to each element, effectively transforming `a[i]` to `a[i] + i + 1`.

3. **Creating the Set `S`:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array.
   - It then converts the modified array to a set to remove duplicates, sorts it in decreasing order, and stores it in `a`.

4. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted set `a` and constructs the result array `b` by:
     - Adding the current element to `b`.
     - Adding intermediate values between the current and previous elements if necessary, based on the count of elements that were removed due to duplicates.
   - Finally, it appends the necessary number of elements to `b` to ensure it has `n` elements, filling in with decreasing values starting from the last element in `b`.

### Key Points to Verify
- **Correctness of Set Construction:** The program correctly constructs the set `S` by adding `a[i] + i + 1` to `S` and ensuring uniqueness.
- **Sorting and Constructing `b`:** The program sorts the set in decreasing order and constructs `b` by adding intermediate values where necessary.
- **Handling Duplicates:** The program correctly handles duplicates by using the `Counter` to keep track of the number of elements that were removed due to duplicates and adding the necessary intermediate values.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. It constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by ensuring that the set `S` contains unique values and that `b` is sorted in decreasing order.

**Correctness: True**
