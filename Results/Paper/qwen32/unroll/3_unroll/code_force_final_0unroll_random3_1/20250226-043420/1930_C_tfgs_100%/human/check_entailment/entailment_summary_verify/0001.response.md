Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap

1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we have an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`.

2. **Process:**
   - Perform the following operation `n` times:
     1. Select an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|).
     2. Insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S` (note that `S` only contains unique elements).
     3. Remove `a[i]` from `a`, shifting the indices of elements to the right of `a[i]` by 1.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.

3. **Output:**
   - Construct a new array `b` which is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.
   - Find the lexicographically largest `b` possible.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

#### Key Steps in the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`.
   - It creates a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in decreasing order.
   - It calculates the number of elements that were removed due to being duplicates (`cnt`).
   - It constructs the array `ans` by iterating through the sorted unique elements of `a`:
     - If the current element is not the first one, it appends additional elements to `ans` to account for the duplicates and to maximize the lexicographical order.
     - It appends the current element to `ans` and updates the `Counter` and `cur` (current count of duplicates).
   - After the loop, if there are still elements to be added (`cnt` > 0), it appends the last element of `ans` minus 1 for each remaining count.
   - Finally, it prints the array `ans`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program correctly uses a `Counter` to handle duplicates and ensures that the final array `b` is constructed by considering the unique elements in decreasing order.

3. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique elements and appends additional elements to `ans` to maximize the lexicographical order by considering the duplicates.
   - It handles the remaining duplicates after the loop by appending the last element of `ans` minus 1 for each remaining count.

### Issues and Challenges

1. **Appending Elements to Maximize Lexicographical Order:**
   - The logic for appending additional elements to `ans` to maximize the lexicographical order seems flawed. The program attempts to fill gaps between unique elements but does not ensure that the resulting array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.
   - Specifically, the logic for appending elements between unique elements (`adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`) is not guaranteed to produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

2. **Handling Remaining Duplicates:**
   - The logic for handling remaining duplicates (`for _ in range(cnt): ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)`) is not optimal. It simply appends the last element minus 1 for each remaining count, which may not be the best way to maximize the lexicographical order.

### Correct Approach

To ensure the lexicographically largest `b`, we should:

1. **Modify the Array `a`:**
   - Add `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`.

2. **Use a Set to Remove Duplicates:**
   - Convert the modified array `a` to a set to remove duplicates.

3. **Sort the Unique Elements:**
   - Sort the unique elements in decreasing order to form the array `b`.

4. **Construct the Lexicographically Largest `b`:**
   - Since the problem requires the lexicographically largest `b`, simply sorting the unique elements in decreasing order is sufficient. The program should not attempt to fill gaps between unique elements or handle remaining duplicates in a way that does not maximize the lexicographical order.

### Revised Program

Here is a revised version of the program that correctly constructs the lexicographically largest `b`:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    unique_elements = sorted(set(a), reverse=True)
    print(*unique_elements)
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly handle the construction of the lexicographically largest `b`. The logic for appending additional elements to maximize the lexicographical order is flawed, and the handling of remaining duplicates is not optimal.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
