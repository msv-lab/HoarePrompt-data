To determine the output state after the execution of the given loop, we need to analyze the loop and understand how it modifies the `ans` list. 

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
```

This loop runs `cnt` times, and in each iteration, it appends to the `ans` list a value that is one less than the last element of `ans`. 

Let's break down the implications:
- `ans[-1]` refers to the last element of the `ans` list.
- In each iteration, the new element appended is `ans[-1] - 1`.

To understand the output state, we need to know the initial value of `ans` before the loop starts. However, the initial value of `ans` is not provided in the problem statement. We will assume that `ans` has at least one element before the loop starts, as the operation `ans[-1]` requires `ans` to be non-empty.

Let's denote the initial last element of `ans` as `x`. After the first iteration, the last element of `ans` becomes `x - 1`. After the second iteration, it becomes `x - 2`, and so on. After `cnt` iterations, the last element of `ans` will be `x - cnt`.

The length of `ans` will increase by `cnt` after the loop, and the new elements will be `x - 1, x - 2, ..., x - cnt`.

Given that the loop does not modify any other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `counter`, `cur`), only `ans` is affected.

Thus, the output state in terms of the `ans` list will be the initial `ans` list with `cnt` additional elements, each element being one less than the previous one.

For the sake of this problem, let's assume the initial `ans` list has one element `[x]`. The output state of `ans` will be `[x, x-1, x-2, ..., x-cnt]`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list that includes its initial elements followed by `cnt` additional elements, each element being one less than the previous one.**
