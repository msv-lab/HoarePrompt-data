### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to ensure it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

1. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it. This step ensures that each element in the array `a` is transformed according to the problem statement.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the modified array. It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in decreasing order. This step ensures that only unique elements are considered for the final array `b`.

3. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique elements and appends additional elements to `ans` to maximize the lexicographical order by considering the duplicates.
   - It calculates `adv` as the minimum of the difference between consecutive elements minus one, the remaining count of elements to be added (`cnt`), and the current count of duplicates (`cur`).
   - It then appends `adv` number of elements that are one less than the previous element to `ans`.
   - After appending these elements, it appends the current element to `ans` and updates the `Counter` and `cur`.
   - Finally, if there are still elements to be added (`cnt` > 0), it appends the last element of `ans` minus 1 for each remaining count.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, which should be the lexicographically largest `b` possible.

### Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

- **State After Modifying `a`:**
  - Each element `a[i]` is modified to \(a_i + i + 1\).
  - The new values of `a_i` will be in the range \([2, 10^9 + n]\).

- **State After Creating `Counter` and Sorting:**
  - `counter` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the modified `a`.
  - `a` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted in descending order.
  - `cnt` is the remaining count of elements that could have been inserted between the elements of `a`.
  - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.

- **State After Constructing `ans`:**
  - The program iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends additional elements to `ans` to maximize the lexicographical order.
  - The final `ans` list includes its initial elements followed by `cnt` additional elements, each element being one less than the previous one.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem. It modifies the array `a` as specified, handles duplicates using a `Counter`, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by appending additional elements where necessary.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

### Final: **True**
