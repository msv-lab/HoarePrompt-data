### Reasoning:

The program aims to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the operations described. Let's break down the program's logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Modifying the Array:**
   - Each element `a[i]` is modified to `a[i] + i + 1`. This step ensures that higher indices contribute more to the value, potentially making larger numbers later in the array more significant.

3. **Creating a Set:**
   - The modified array is converted to a set to remove duplicates. This aligns with the problem statement's requirement that the set `S` does not contain duplicate elements.

4. **Sorting and Constructing `b`:**
   - The unique elements are sorted in descending order.
   - The program then constructs the array `b` by adding elements to fill gaps between the unique elements in descending order. This is done by checking the difference between consecutive elements and filling in the gaps with the appropriate number of elements.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If there are any remaining elements to be added to `b` (determined by `cnt`), they are appended in descending order, starting from the last element in `b`.

### Verification:

- **Lexicographical Order:**
  - The program ensures that the array `b` is constructed to be lexicographically largest by sorting the unique elements in descending order and filling gaps appropriately.
  
- **Handling Duplicates:**
  - By converting the list to a set, duplicates are removed, which is consistent with the problem's requirement that `S` is a set.

- **Filling Gaps:**
  - The logic for filling gaps between unique elements ensures that the resulting array `b` is as large as possible lexicographically.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements and correctly constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
