### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation for every test case as described in the problem statement.

#### Program Analysis:
The program constructs a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers. Specifically:
1. It initializes the permutation with the smallest number (1).
2. It then alternates between adding the next smallest and the next largest number from the remaining numbers.

Here is the provided code for reference:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)
```

#### Annotated Code:
```python
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is even. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: For each test case with given `n` and `k`, the `answer` list will be constructed by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the initial array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` will remain unchanged except for `answer` being updated for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the initial list `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` and prints the resulting list. The function does not return any value; it outputs the result directly.
```

#### Example Analysis:
Let's examine the example cases provided in the problem statement.

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** `2 2`
- **Output:** `2 1`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 2 are `[2+1] = [3]`. The difference is `0`, which satisfies the condition.

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `3 2`
- **Output:** `1 3 2`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 2 are `[1+3] = [4]` and `[3+2] = [5]`. The difference is `1`, which satisfies the condition.

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** `10 4`
- **Output:** `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 4 are `[1+8+4+10] = [23]`, `[8+4+10+2] = [24]`, `[4+10+2+7] = [23]`, `[10+2+7+5] = [24]`, `[2+7+5+9] = [23]`, `[7+5+9+3] = [24]`, `[5+9+3+6] = [23]`. The difference is `1`, which satisfies the condition.

#### Example 4:
- **Input:** `13 4`
- **Output:** `4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 4 are `[4+10+1+13] = [28]`, `[10+1+13+5] = [29]`, `[1+13+5+9] = [28]`, `[13+5+9+2] = [29]`, `[5+9+2+12] = [28]`, `[9+2+12+6] = [29]`, `[2+12+6+8] = [28]`, `[12+6+8+3] = [29]`, `[6+8+3+11] = [28]`, `[8+3+11+7] = [29]`. The difference is `1`, which satisfies the condition.

#### Example 5:
- **Input:** `7 4`
- **Output:** `1 6 3 7 2 5 4`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 4 are `[1+6+3+7] = [17]`, `[6+3+7+2] = [18]`, `[3+7+2+5] = [17]`, `[7+2+5+4] = [18]`. The difference is `1`, which satisfies the condition.

#### General Case Analysis:
The program constructs a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers. This approach ensures that the sums of the segments of length `k` are as balanced as possible. Since `k` is even, the alternating pattern helps to distribute the sums evenly, ensuring that the maximum and minimum sums differ by no more than 1.

However, let's consider a more rigorous check. The alternating pattern does not guarantee that the sums of all segments of length `k` will differ by no more than 1 for all possible values of `n` and `k`. For example, consider the case where `n=6` and `k=4`:

- **Input:** `6 4`
- **Output:** `1 6 2 5 3 4`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 4 are `[1+6+2+5] = [14]`, `[6+2+5+3] = [16]`, `[2+5+3+4] = [14]`. The difference is `2`, which does not satisfy the condition.

This example shows that the alternating pattern does not always produce a k-level permutation. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct k-level permutation for all inputs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the example cases and the general approach of the program, it appears that the program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation for every test case as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**.
