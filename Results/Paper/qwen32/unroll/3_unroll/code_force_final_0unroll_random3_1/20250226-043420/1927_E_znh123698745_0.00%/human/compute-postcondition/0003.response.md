Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the initial list `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` and prints the resulting list. The function does not return any value; it outputs the result directly.**
