You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the initial list `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` and prints the resulting list. The function does not return any value; it outputs the result directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n. A k-level permutation is defined such that the sums of all continuous segments of length k in the permutation differ by no more than 1.

### Program Analysis
The provided program constructs a permutation using the following logic:
1. It initializes an array `array` containing numbers from 1 to n.
2. It creates an initial answer list `answer` starting with the number 1.
3. It uses a list `a` initialized with `[1, -1]` to alternate between picking elements from the start and the end of the `array`.
4. For each subsequent element in the permutation, it alternates between picking the next smallest and the next largest available number from `array` based on the index's parity.
5. The constructed permutation is then printed.

### Correctness Check
To check the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the resulting permutation satisfies the k-level condition for all test cases.

#### Key Points to Consider:
- **Alternating Selection**: The program alternates between the smallest and largest available numbers. This means that the sums of the segments of length k will likely be close to each other, but it does not guarantee that the maximum and minimum sums will differ by no more than 1.
- **General Approach**: The provided approach does not seem to guarantee the k-level condition for all values of n and k. For example, consider the case where n is large and k is relatively small. The alternating pattern may not ensure that all segment sums are within 1 of each other.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's take an example to illustrate potential issues:
- For `n=10` and `k=4`, the program might generate a permutation like `1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6`.
- The sums of segments of length 4 are `1+10+2+9=22`, `10+2+9+3=24`, `2+9+3+8=22`, `9+3+8+4=24`, `3+8+4+7=22`, `8+4+7+5=24`, `4+7+5+6=22`.
- Here, the maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 22, which satisfies the k-level condition.

However, this does not prove correctness for all possible inputs. We need to consider edge cases and larger values of n and k.

### Conclusion
While the program might work for some test cases, it does not guarantee that the k-level condition will be met for all possible values of n and k based on the given approach. The alternating selection pattern might not always result in a k-level permutation.

Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed based on the provided logic and implementation.
