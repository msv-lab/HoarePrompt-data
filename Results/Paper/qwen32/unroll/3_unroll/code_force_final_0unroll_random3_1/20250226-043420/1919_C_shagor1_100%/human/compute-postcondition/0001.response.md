Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the size of the array `a`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array `a`. The function processes each test case and returns a specific output based on the elements of the array `a`.**
