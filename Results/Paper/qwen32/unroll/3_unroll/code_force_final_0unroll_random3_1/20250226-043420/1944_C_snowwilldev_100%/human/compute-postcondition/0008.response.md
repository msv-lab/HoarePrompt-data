Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of an array `a`, followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided array elements.**
