Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed because it does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during the game. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Optimal Play**: The function does not consider the optimal moves that Alice and Bob would make. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. This means that Alice would try to add elements to `c` that would delay Bob from minimizing the MEX, and Bob would try to remove elements that would help minimize the MEX.

2. **Counting Logic**: The function counts the occurrences of each number in `a` but does not simulate the game turns. It simply returns the first number that appears exactly once or is missing, which does not reflect the outcome of the game.

3. **Game Simulation**: The function does not simulate the game where elements are alternately removed from `a` and added to `c`. Instead, it makes a decision based on the initial counts, which is not sufficient to determine the final state of `c`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game, taking into account the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. This involves keeping track of the numbers that have been added to `c` and ensuring that we always consider the smallest possible MEX after each move.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
