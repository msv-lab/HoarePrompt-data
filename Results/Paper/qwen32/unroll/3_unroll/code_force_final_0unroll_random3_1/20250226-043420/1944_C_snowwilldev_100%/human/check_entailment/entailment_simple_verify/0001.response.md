### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and verify the program's correctness using the annotations and the provided code.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
    - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
    - Bob wants to minimize it.

#### Key Observations:
- Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least `k` if she can force the presence of the first `k` non-negative integers in `c`.
- Bob can prevent the MEX from being `k` if he can prevent all the first `k` non-negative integers from being in `c`.

#### Strategy:
- **Count Occurrences**: Count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
- **Determine MEX**:
    - If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once in `a`, Alice can ensure that these numbers are in `c`, maximizing the MEX.
    - Otherwise, Bob can force the MEX to be lower by strategically removing elements.

#### Code Analysis:
The code correctly counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` to determine the MEX based on the counts.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The code correctly counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
2. **Determining MEX**:
    - The variable `t` counts the number of unique numbers that appear exactly once.
    - The loop iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` and checks the count of each number.
    - If a number appears exactly once, `t` is incremented.
    - If `t` reaches `2`, it means there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, and the MEX is the current number `i`.
    - If a number does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), the MEX is the current number `i`.

#### Annotations:
- **State after counting occurrences**: The `cnt` dictionary correctly holds the frequency of each integer in the list `a`.
- **State during MEX determination**: The loop correctly checks for the first number that either has a count of 0 or is the second number with a count of 1.

#### Validation:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `4`, `0 0 1 1`
  - `cnt`: `{0: 2, 1: 2}`
  - `t` remains `0` because no number appears exactly once.
  - The loop returns `0` because `cnt[0] != 0` and `cnt[1] != 0`, but `cnt[2] == 0`.
  - **Expected Output**: `2` (Incorrect, should be `2` based on the example explanation, but the code returns `0`).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `4`, `0 1 2 3`
  - `cnt`: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
  - `t` becomes `1` at `i=0`, `t` becomes `2` at `i=1`.
  - The loop returns `1` because `t >= 2`.
  - **Expected Output**: `1` (Correct).

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `2`, `1 1`
  - `cnt`: `{1: 2}`
  - `t` remains `0` because no number appears exactly once.
  - The loop returns `0` because `cnt[0] == 0`.
  - **Expected Output**: `0` (Correct).

#### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle the first example, as it returns `0` instead of `2`. This indicates that the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The code should correctly identify the smallest non-negative integer that either has a count of `0` or is the second number with a count of `1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
