### Reasoning:
The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function, `func_2`, handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case. The function `func_1` processes each individual test case to find the optimal position to place the road according to the problem description.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1`:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - It reads an integer `n` representing the number of houses.
   - It reads a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]`.
   - It iterates through the string `a`, updating the counts of '0's and '1's encountered so far. For each character `s` in `a`, it appends a new list `[x, y]` to `S`, where `x` is the count of '0's and `y` is the count of '1's up to that point.
   
3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - It initializes `ans` to -1, which will hold the best position found.
   - It iterates over all possible positions `i` where the road can be placed (from 0 to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of '0's to the left of the road (inclusive of the `i`-th house).
     - `lsum`: the total number of houses to the left of the road.
     - `right`: the number of '1's to the right of the road.
     - `rsum`: the total number of houses to the right of the road.
   - It checks if the conditions are met: at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied (i.e., `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - If the conditions are met and the position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the current best position `ans`, it updates `ans` to `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the optimal position `ans`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the prefix sums efficiently and checks the conditions for each possible position to find the optimal one. The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the prefix sums and checks the conditions for each possible position to find the optimal one where the road can be placed. It handles multiple test cases efficiently.
Correctness: **True**
