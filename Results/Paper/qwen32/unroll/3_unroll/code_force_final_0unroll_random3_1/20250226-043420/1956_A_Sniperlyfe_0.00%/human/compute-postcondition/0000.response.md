To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head. The loop will execute if `n >= min(p)`, where `n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players, and `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, with each element in `p` being greater than 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: It is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players. No specific constraints are given on `n` other than it being non-negative.
2. **Variable `p`**: It is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0. This means `min(p)` will be at least 1.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `n >= min(p)`.
- Since `min(p)` is at least 1 (because each element in `p` is greater than 0), `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Adjustment Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be adjusted to be at least 1. Since `p` is already defined with elements greater than 0, no adjustments are needed for `p`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `p` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0**.
