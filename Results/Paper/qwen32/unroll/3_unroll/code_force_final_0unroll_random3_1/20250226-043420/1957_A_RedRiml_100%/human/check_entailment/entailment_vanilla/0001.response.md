Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using given sticks, where each polygon has equal sides and each stick can be used in only one polygon.
- A polygon requires at least 3 sides.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`w`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`ln`) and the lengths of the sticks (`palka`).

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is used to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Polygons:**
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`), the number of polygons that can be formed using those sticks is `d[j] // 3`.
   - The total number of polygons (`shapes`) is accumulated accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the total number of polygons that can be formed.

### Correctness Check:
- **Handling of Minimum Polygon Sides:** The program correctly checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length to form a polygon.
- **Counting Polygons:** The program correctly calculates the number of polygons by integer division (`d[j] // 3`), which ensures that only complete polygons are counted.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The program processes each test case independently and prints the result for each.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Stick (n = 1):** The program correctly returns `0` because a single stick cannot form a polygon.
- **Two Sticks (n = 2):** The program correctly returns `0` because two sticks cannot form a polygon.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The program handles multiple test cases as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
