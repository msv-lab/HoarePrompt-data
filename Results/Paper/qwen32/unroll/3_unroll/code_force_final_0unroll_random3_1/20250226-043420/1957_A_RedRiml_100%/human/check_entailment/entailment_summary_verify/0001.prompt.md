You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers, and for each test case, it calculates and prints the number of shapes that can be formed, where each shape requires at least three identical integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using given sticks, where each polygon has equal sides and each stick can be used in only one polygon.
- A polygon requires at least 3 sides.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`w`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`ln`) and the lengths of the sticks (`palka`).

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is used to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Polygons:**
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`), the number of polygons that can be formed using those sticks is `d[j] // 3`.
   - The total number of polygons (`shapes`) is accumulated accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the total number of polygons that can be formed.

### Correctness Check:
- **Handling of Minimum Polygon Sides:** The program correctly checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length to form a polygon.
- **Counting Polygons:** The program correctly calculates the number of polygons by integer division (`d[j] // 3`), which ensures that only complete polygons are counted.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The program processes each test case independently and prints the result for each.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Stick (n = 1):** The program correctly returns `0` because a single stick cannot form a polygon.
- **Two Sticks (n = 2):** The program correctly returns `0` because two sticks cannot form a polygon.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The program handles multiple test cases as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
