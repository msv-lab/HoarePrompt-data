#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.

    #State: a series of w integers, each representing the number of shapes that can be formed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers, and for each test case, it calculates and prints the number of shapes that can be formed, where each shape requires at least three identical integers.
