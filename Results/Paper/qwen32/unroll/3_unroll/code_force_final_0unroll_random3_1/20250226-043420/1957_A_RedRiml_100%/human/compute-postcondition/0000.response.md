Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; w is an input integer.**

In this output state, the variable `w` is assigned the value of the input integer, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
