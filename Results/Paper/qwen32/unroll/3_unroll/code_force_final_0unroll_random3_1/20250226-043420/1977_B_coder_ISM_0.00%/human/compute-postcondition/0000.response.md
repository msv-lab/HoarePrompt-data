The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition states that `t` is initially an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input. The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= t <= 10^4), `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < 2^30.**
