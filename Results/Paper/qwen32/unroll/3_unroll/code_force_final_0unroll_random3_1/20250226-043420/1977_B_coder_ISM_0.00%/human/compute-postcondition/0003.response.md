Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4) and `x` (a positive integer representing the value for each test case, where 1 <= x < 2^30). For each test case, the function returns a value based on the conditions specified for `x`.**
