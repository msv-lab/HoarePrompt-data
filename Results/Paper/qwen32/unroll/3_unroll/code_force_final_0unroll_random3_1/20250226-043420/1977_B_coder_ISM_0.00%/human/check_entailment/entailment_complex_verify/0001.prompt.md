You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: the final length of the binary representation after processing the last integer `x` and the modified binary representation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x`, processes its binary representation, and outputs the modified binary representation along with its length. The modification involves replacing consecutive '1's with a '-1' and '1', and adjusting the binary string based on specific rules to ensure no consecutive '1's remain, except for the special case of a trailing '1' after a '-1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30).

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case:
     - The length of the array `n`.
     - The array `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` where each `a_i` is 1, 0, or -1.
     - The array must satisfy the equation \(x = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot 2^i\).
     - No two consecutive elements in the array should be non-zero.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.
   - It then iterates over the first 30 bits of `x` (since `x < 2^30`), appending '1' or '0' to `s` based on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set.

3. **Modification to Satisfy Conditions:**
   - The program then goes through the list `s` to modify it such that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - It uses a flag to keep track of whether a modification has been made.
   - If two consecutive elements are '1', it changes the first to '-1' and the second to '0'.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes it to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is not '0', it changes it to '0'.
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set and the last element is not '0', it changes the last element to '0' and appends '1' to `s`, increasing the length.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program then goes through the modified list `s` to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - If it finds a '-1' followed by a '1', it swaps them.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the length of the modified list and the modified list itself.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Binary Conversion:**
   - The program converts `x` to a binary string and stores it in `s` as strings ('1', '0'), not integers (1, 0).

2. **Incorrect Adjustment Logic:**
   - The logic to adjust the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero is flawed.
   - The flag mechanism and the adjustments made do not guarantee that the resulting list will satisfy the conditions of the problem.
   - The final adjustment loop does not correctly handle all cases.

3. **Output Issues:**
   - The program prints the list `s` before making the necessary adjustments, which is incorrect.
   - The length of the list is not correctly calculated after modifications.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
