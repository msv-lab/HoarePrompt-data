Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then compares these two integers and prints the smaller one followed by the larger one, which aligns with the problem description. The logic for determining the minimum and maximum of two numbers is correctly implemented using a simple if-else statement. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as intended for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
