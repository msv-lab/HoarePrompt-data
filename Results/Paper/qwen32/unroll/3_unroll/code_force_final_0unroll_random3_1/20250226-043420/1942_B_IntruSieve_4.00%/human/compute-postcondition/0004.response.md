The code snippet initializes the variable `maxx` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0.**
