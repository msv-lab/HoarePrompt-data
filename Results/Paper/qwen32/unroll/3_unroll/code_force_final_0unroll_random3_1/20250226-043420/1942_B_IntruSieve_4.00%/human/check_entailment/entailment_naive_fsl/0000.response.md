Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect by considering a specific test case.

### Problem Understanding:
The array `a` is constructed such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

### Example Test Case:
Let's consider the following test case from the problem description:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

### Explanation of the Expected Output:
- `a_1 = MEX(p_1) - p_1`
  - `MEX([0]) = 1`
  - `a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1`
- `a_2 = MEX(p_1, p_2) - p_2`
  - `MEX([0, 1]) = 2`
  - `a_2 = 2 - 1 = 1`
- `a_3 = MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3) - p_3`
  - `MEX([0, 1, 4]) = 2`
  - `a_3 = 2 - 4 = -2`
- `a_4 = MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) - p_4`
  - `MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3`
  - `a_4 = 3 - 2 = 1`
- `a_5 = MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5) - p_5`
  - `MEX([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) = 5`
  - `a_5 = 5 - 3 = 2`

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by maintaining a `mex` list and adjusting the `minn` and `maxx` variables. However, it does not correctly compute the `p_i` values based on the `a_i` values.

### Issue in the Program:
- The program incorrectly computes the `mex` values and the permutation `p` values. Specifically, the logic for handling negative `a_i` values is incorrect.
- The program does not properly track the MEX value of the current prefix of `p` and adjust `p_i` accordingly.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the same test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Program Output:**
The provided program might output something like `0 1 2 3 4` or another incorrect permutation, which does not satisfy the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` for all possible inputs, including the given test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.

Correctness: **False**
