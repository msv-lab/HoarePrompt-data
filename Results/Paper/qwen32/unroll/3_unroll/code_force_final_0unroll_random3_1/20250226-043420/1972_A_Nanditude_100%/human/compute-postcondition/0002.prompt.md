Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of problems. This is followed by two lines: the first line contains a sorted list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and the second line contains a sorted list b of n integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 100. `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
