You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of problems. This is followed by two lines: the first line contains a sorted list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and the second line contains a sorted list b of n integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 100.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two sorted lists of integers representing the difficulties of proposed and expected problems. For each test case, it calculates and prints the count of expected difficulties that are less than the smallest unpaired proposed difficulty.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have two lists, `a` and `b`, each of length `n`.
- Initially, `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- We need to determine the minimum number of new problems to propose (each with difficulty `w`) such that after inserting each new problem and removing the most difficult one, all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the length of the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic:**
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero, which will keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse the lists `a` and `b` respectively.
   - For each element `b[j]` in `b`, it checks if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.
     - If true, it increments the counter `cnt` (indicating a new problem needs to be proposed).
     - If false, it moves the pointer `i` to the next element in `a` (indicating that the current `a[i]` can be matched with `b[j]`).

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in `b`, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic in the program is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the process of inserting a new problem and removing the most difficult one.
- The program assumes that if `b[j] < a[i]`, a new problem needs to be proposed. However, it does not actually insert this new problem or remove the most difficult one from `a`.
- The program does not sort `a` after inserting a new problem, which is a crucial step in the problem description.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would involve:
  - Iterating through `b` and `a` simultaneously.
  - If `b[j] < a[i]`, insert a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` into `a`, sort `a`, and then remove the last element.
  - Continue this process until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
