t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), a list a of length n with integers (1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9), and a list b of length n with integers (1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9).
