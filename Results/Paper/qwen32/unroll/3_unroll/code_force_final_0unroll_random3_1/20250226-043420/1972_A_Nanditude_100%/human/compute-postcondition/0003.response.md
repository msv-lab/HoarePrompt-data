Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems, a sorted list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and a sorted list `b` of `n` integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9) representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether the proposed difficulties match the expected difficulties.**
