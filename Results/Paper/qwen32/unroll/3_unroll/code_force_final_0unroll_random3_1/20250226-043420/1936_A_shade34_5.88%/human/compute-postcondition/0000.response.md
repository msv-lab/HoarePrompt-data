In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the `range(int(input()))` function call. This means that the only variable we can adjust directly to ensure the loop executes is `t`, as it dictates how many times the loop will run.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The initial state already satisfies this condition since \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

The variables `n` and `p` are mentioned in the context of each test case but are not directly part of the loop head. Thus, we do not need to adjust them for the loop to start executing.

**State:** **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute at least once since `t` is within the specified range.
