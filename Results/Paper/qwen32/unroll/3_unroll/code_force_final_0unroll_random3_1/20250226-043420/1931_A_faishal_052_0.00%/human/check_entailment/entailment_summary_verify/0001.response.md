### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the provided function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that corresponds to a given encoded sum. The encoded sum is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. For example, the word "cat" encodes to 24 (3 + 1 + 20). The goal is to find the smallest possible word (in lexicographical order) that could result in this sum.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer (`lex`), which represents the encoded sum.

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to fill the first two positions of the word:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` (representing 'a') and reduces `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` (representing 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
     - Otherwise, it also appends 26 to `arr` (representing 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr` (representing the third letter).

3. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
   - It then converts each number in `arr` to its corresponding letter (by adding 96 to the number and converting it to a character) and prints them.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Values:**
  - The program's logic for handling values of `lex` is flawed. For example, if `lex` is 78, the correct word should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26), but the program will incorrectly handle the values and may not produce the correct result.
- **Logic for Lexicographical Order:**
  - The sorting step is not needed if the program correctly generates the letters in the first place. The goal is to generate the smallest possible letters first, which is not guaranteed by this approach.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle the smallest possible sum (3, corresponding to "aaa") correctly.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate the letters in a way that ensures they are in lexicographical order. Here's a step-by-step correct approach:
1. Start with the smallest possible letter for the first position.
2. Adjust the remaining sum and proceed to the next letter.
3. Ensure that the letters are in lexicographical order by generating them in ascending order.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the letters to 'a' (1)
        a = b = c = 1
        # Adjust the sum
        lex -= 3  # Since we start with 'aaa'
        # Distribute the remaining sum to b and c
        if lex > 25:
            b += 25
            lex -= 25
        else:
            b += lex
            lex = 0
        c += lex
        # Print the result
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly handle the generation of the letters in lexicographical order and fails to produce the correct results for various test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
