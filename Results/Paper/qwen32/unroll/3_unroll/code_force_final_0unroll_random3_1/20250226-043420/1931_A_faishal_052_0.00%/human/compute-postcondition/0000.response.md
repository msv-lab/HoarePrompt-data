The code snippet `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it will replace the initial value of `t` in the output state.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and `cases` will take this value after the input, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, and for each of the `cases` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 78.**
