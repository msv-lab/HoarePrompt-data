Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:** An integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by `t` integers `n` (each between 3 and 78 inclusive).
2. **Output:** For each integer `n`, output the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose letters' positions in the alphabet sum up to `n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` (the encoded word).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop to process the first two positions:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends `1` to `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, it appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is 52 or more, it appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the list `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
   - It converts each number in `arr` to its corresponding letter by adding `96` (since `chr(97)` is 'a') and prints the letters.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value:**
   - The program incorrectly appends the remaining value of `lex` after processing the first two positions. This can lead to incorrect results if the remaining value is less than 1 or greater than 26.
2. **Sorting Only After Processing:**
   - Sorting the list after processing the first two positions and the remaining value does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. The program should ensure that the first letter is the smallest possible, then the second, and so on.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Iteratively Determine Each Letter:**
   - Start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally adjust to reach the sum `n`.
   - Ensure that the sum of the positions equals `n` and that the letters are in lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each test case. It incorrectly handles the remaining value and does not ensure the correct order of letters.

**Correctness: False**
