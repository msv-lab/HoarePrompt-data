In this task, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cases`. The loop will execute as long as `cases` is greater than 0 because the `range(cases)` function will generate numbers from 0 up to `cases - 1`. 

Given the state before the loop starts, `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100. This means the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once because `cases` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cases` to ensure the loop executes.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because its value is determined by the `range` function during each iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state before the loop starts already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute. No further adjustments are necessary.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100**
