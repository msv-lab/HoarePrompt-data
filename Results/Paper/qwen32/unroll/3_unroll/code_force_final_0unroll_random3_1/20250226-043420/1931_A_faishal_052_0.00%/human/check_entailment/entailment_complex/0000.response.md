### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given integer sum of the positions of its letters in the alphabet. The program reads multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` representing the encoded word, and outputs the corresponding word.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` representing the encoded word.

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty array `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop where it tries to distribute the value of `lex` among the three positions.
   - For the first two positions, it checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26. If so, it appends 1 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 1. If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26. Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
   - After processing the first two positions, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The array `arr` now contains three values representing the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

3. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The program sorts the array `arr` to ensure that the word is lexicographically smallest.
   - It then converts each value in `arr` to its corresponding letter by adding 96 (since 'a' is ASCII 97) and prints the letters without a newline in between.

Let's consider the test cases provided:

- For `n = 24`:
  - The program appends 1, 1 (since 24 - 1 - 1 = 22), and 22 to `arr`.
  - Sorting `arr` gives `[1, 1, 22]`, which corresponds to the word "aav".

- For `n = 70`:
  - The program appends 26, 26, and 18 to `arr`.
  - Sorting `arr` gives `[18, 26, 26]`, which corresponds to the word "rzz".

- For `n = 3`:
  - The program appends 1, 1, and 1 to `arr`.
  - Sorting `arr` gives `[1, 1, 1]`, which corresponds to the word "aaa".

- For `n = 55`:
  - The program appends 26, 26, and 3 to `arr`.
  - Sorting `arr` gives `[3, 26, 26]`, which corresponds to the word "czz".

- For `n = 48`:
  - The program appends 26, 26, and 6 to `arr`.
  - Sorting `arr` gives `[6, 26, 26]`, which corresponds to the word "auz".

The program correctly generates the lexicographically smallest word for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
