To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `cases` times, where `cases` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, it initializes an empty list `arr` and reads an integer `lex` from the input.
3. **Condition Checks**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is less than 52 but greater than 26, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is 52 or more, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
4. **Appending Remaining Lex**: After the first two iterations of the inner loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
5. **Sorting**: The list `arr` is sorted.
6. **Printing**: The first three elements of the sorted `arr` are converted to characters (by adding 96 to each element) and printed.

Let's analyze the behavior for a few values of `lex`:

- If `lex` is 26 or less, `arr` will be `[1, 1, lex-1]` after the first two iterations, and after sorting, the first three elements will be `[1, 1, lex-1]`. The output will be `aaa` to `zzz` depending on `lex`.
- If `lex` is between 27 and 52, `arr` will be `[1, 26, lex-26]` after the first two iterations, and after sorting, the first three elements will be `[1, lex-26, 26]`. The output will be a combination of `a` and the corresponding characters for `lex-26` and `z`.
- If `lex` is 52 or more, `arr` will be `[26, 26, lex-52]` after the first two iterations, and after sorting, the first three elements will be `[26, 26, lex-52]`. The output will be a combination of `z` and the corresponding character for `lex-52`.

Given the constraints (3 <= `n` <= 78), the output will be a combination of lowercase letters based on the value of `lex` for each test case.

Since the exact values of `lex` are not provided, the output state will depend on the specific values of `lex` for each test case. However, the general format of the output state will be a series of three lowercase letters for each test case.

Output State: **a series of three lowercase letters for each test case, based on the value of `lex` for each test case.**
