Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, the annotations, and the original assessment.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word (using lowercase Latin letters) that sums up to a given encoded integer. The letters are numbered from 1 ('a') to 26 ('z').

### Provided Program
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `lex` representing the encoded sum. It then tries to construct the word by assigning values to the letters in a specific manner and sorts the values before converting them to corresponding letters.

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, indicating how the values are being assigned and sorted.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. It provides a specific example (`lex = 28`) where the program outputs "aaz" instead of the correct "aab".

### Analysis
Let's analyze the program step-by-step and see if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the encoded sum `lex`.

2. **Constructing the Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr`.
   - For the first two letters, it checks the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex <= 26`, it assigns 1 to the first two letters and the remaining value to the third letter.
     - If `lex < 52`, it assigns 26 to the first letter, 1 to the second letter, and the remaining value to the third letter.
     - If `lex >= 52`, it assigns 26 to the first two letters and the remaining value to the third letter.

3. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The program sorts the list `arr` and then converts each value to the corresponding character by adding 96 (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII).

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the provided example `lex = 28`:
- According to the program logic:
  - Since `lex >= 52` is false and `lex < 52` is true, the program assigns `arr = [26, 1, 1]`.
  - Sorting `arr` gives `[1, 1, 26]`, which corresponds to the letters 'a', 'a', and 'z', resulting in "aaz".

### Correct Approach
The provided program does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. A correct approach should involve assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters while ensuring the sum of all three letters equals the encoded sum.

For example, for `lex = 28`, the correct smallest word should be "aab" (1 + 1 + 26).

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded sum.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
