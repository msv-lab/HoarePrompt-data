### Reasoning:

The program provided is designed to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, it iterates through each character position `i` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. If the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it checks whether `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`, since they are the same). If `c[i]` is different, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that a suitable template exists.
3. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, it checks whether `c[i]` is the same as either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is neither, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that a suitable template exists.
4. If the loop completes without setting `possible` to `True`, it means no such template exists for the current test case, and it sets `possible` to `False`.
5. Based on the value of `possible`, it prints "YES" or "NO".

The logic is correct according to the problem description:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` must be uppercase (different from `a[i]`) and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` to satisfy the condition.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` can be either `A` (uppercase, different from `a[i]`) or `B` (uppercase, different from `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` to satisfy the condition.

The execution summary aligns with this logic, indicating that the program correctly identifies the existence of such a template for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
