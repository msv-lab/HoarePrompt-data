The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it determines if there exists at least one position where the character in `c` does not match the character in either `a` or `b`, and prints 'YES' if such a position exists, otherwise 'NO'.
