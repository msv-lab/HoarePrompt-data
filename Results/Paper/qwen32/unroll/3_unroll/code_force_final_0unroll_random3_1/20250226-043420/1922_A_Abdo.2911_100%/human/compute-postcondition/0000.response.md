The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases, and its value is now specified. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
