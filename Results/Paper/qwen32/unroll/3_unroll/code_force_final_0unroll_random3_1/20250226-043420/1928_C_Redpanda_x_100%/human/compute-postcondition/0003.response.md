The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `nn`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i * i <= nn`. 

Given that `i` is initially 2 and `nn` is a positive integer greater than 1, we need to ensure that `i * i` is less than or equal to `nn` for the loop to execute.

Since `i` is 2, `i * i` equals 4. Therefore, `nn` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `factors` is an empty dictionary; `nn` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and equal to `n`; `i` is 2**
