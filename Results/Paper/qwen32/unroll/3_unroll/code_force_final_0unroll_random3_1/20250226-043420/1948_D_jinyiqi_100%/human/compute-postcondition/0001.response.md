Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters derived from the input string, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000. `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

Natural Language: The variable `n` is now assigned the length of the list `s`. The other variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
