The code snippet `s = list(input())` takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters. Given the initial state, `s` was a string of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. After the execution of the code, `s` will be a list containing each character of the input string as its elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters derived from the input string, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000.**
