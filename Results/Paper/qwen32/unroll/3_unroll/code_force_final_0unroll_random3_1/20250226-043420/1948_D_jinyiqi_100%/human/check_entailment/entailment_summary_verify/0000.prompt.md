You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads a string `s` and checks for the longest contiguous substring where each character either matches its corresponding character `j` positions ahead or is a question mark. It prints twice the length of this substring if found; otherwise, it prints `0`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the replacement of question marks to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it fails.

The current implementation checks for potential tandem repeats by iterating over possible lengths of the first half of the tandem repeat (from `n // 2` down to `1`) and then checks if the characters at the corresponding positions in the string match or if one of them is a question mark. If it finds a valid tandem repeat of length `j`, it prints `j * 2` and exits. If no valid tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`.

However, the program does not actually replace any question marks in the string. It only checks if a valid tandem repeat can be formed with the current characters and question marks. This means that the program might return a suboptimal result because it does not consider the optimal replacements for question marks to maximize the length of the tandem repeat.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
code?????s
```
The program might output `0` or a small number because it does not replace the question marks optimally to form a longer tandem repeat. However, the optimal solution would be to replace the question marks in such a way that the entire string becomes a tandem repeat. For example, replacing the question marks with 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e', 'c' would result in the string "codecods", which contains a tandem repeat "codecode" of length 8.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the replacement of question marks to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring.
