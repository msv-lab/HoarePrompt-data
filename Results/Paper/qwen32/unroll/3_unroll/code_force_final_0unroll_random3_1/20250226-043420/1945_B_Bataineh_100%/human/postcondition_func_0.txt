The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `m`. Specifically, it prints `2` if both `a` and `b` are greater than `m`. If only `b` is greater than `m`, it prints `2 + m // b`. If only `a` is greater than `m`, it prints `2 + m // a`. Otherwise, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
