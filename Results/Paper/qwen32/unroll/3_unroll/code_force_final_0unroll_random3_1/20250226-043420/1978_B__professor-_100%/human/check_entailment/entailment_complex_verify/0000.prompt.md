You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: The loop will print `t` lines, each representing the result of the calculation based on the input values `n`, `a`, and `b` for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`. The printed value represents the result of a computation that varies depending on whether `b` is less than or equal to `a`, or if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or neither of these conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has `n` buns to sell. The usual price of a bun is `a` coins. To attract customers, he can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price where the `i-th` bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the maximum profit based on the following logic:
1. If `b <= a`, it sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
2. If `b - a >= n`, it sells all buns at the modified price, which results in a profit of the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling the first `(b - a)` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.

### Potential Issues:
Let's consider the logic in the program and see if it covers all possible cases correctly.

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - The program correctly sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - This is correct.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - The program calculates the profit as the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - The formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` correctly computes this sum.
   - This is correct.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - The program calculates the profit by selling the first `(b - a)` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` is incorrect.
   - The correct formula should be the sum of the first `(b - a)` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from the remaining buns sold at `a`.
   - The correct formula should be `((b + (b - (b - a) + 1)) * (b - a) // 2) + a * (n - (b - a))`.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Let's consider the test case `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`.
- The program calculates the profit as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n = 1 * 2 // 2 + 4 * 4 = 1 + 16 = 17`.
- However, the correct calculation should be `((5 + (5 - (5 - 1) + 1)) * (5 - 1) // 2) + 4 * (4 - (5 - 1)) = (5 + 2) * 1 // 2 + 4 * 0 = 3 + 0 = 3 + 4 * 3 = 3 + 12 = 15 + 2 = 17`.
- In this case, the program seems to work correctly, but let's consider another case.

Let's consider the test case `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`.
- The program calculates the profit as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n = 4 * 5 // 2 + 5 * 5 = 10 + 25 = 35`.
- However, the correct calculation should be `((9 + (9 - (9 - 4) + 1)) * (9 - 4) // 2) + 5 * (5 - (9 - 4)) = (9 + 5) * 4 // 2 + 5 * 0 = 14 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 0 = 28 + 25 = 35`.
- In this case, the program seems to work correctly, but let's consider another case.

Let's consider the test case `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`.
- The program calculates the profit as `n * a = 10 * 10 = 100`.
- This is correct.

Let's consider the test case `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 1`.
- The program calculates the profit as `n * a = 10 * 10 = 100`.
- This is correct.

Let's consider the test case `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`.
- The program calculates the profit as `((2 * 1000 - 1000 + 1) * 1000 // 2) = 1000500`.
- This is correct.

### Conclusion:
Upon closer inspection, the formula used in the program for the case `b - a < n` is incorrect. The program does not correctly calculate the sum of the first `(b - a)` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the profit for the case `b - a < n`. The formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `((b + (b - (b - a) + 1)) * (b - a) // 2) + a * (n - (b - a))`.
