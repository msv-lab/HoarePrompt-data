### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic used to compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling his buns based on the given conditions.

1. **Case 1: \( b \le a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) of the first bun is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \) because selling at the modified price would yield less or equal profit.
   - The formula used is `n * a`, which correctly computes the total profit if all buns are sold at the usual price.

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \ge n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the modified price because the price decrease per bun is not significant enough to make selling at the usual price more profitable.
   - The formula used is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`, which calculates the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is \( b \) and the last term is \( b - n + 1 \). This correctly computes the total profit if all buns are sold at the modified price.

3. **Case 3: Neither of the above conditions holds**
   - If \( b > a \) and \( b - a < n \), it is optimal for Bob to sell the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
   - The formula used is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`, which calculates the sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the modified price series and adds the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price. However, this formula is not correct for this case. The correct formula should be derived from the sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the modified price series and the remaining buns at the usual price. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{b-a} (b - i + 1) + a \times (n - (b - a)) = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))
     \]
     This formula correctly computes the total profit if the first \( b - a \) buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price.

However, the provided code does not correctly handle the third case. The formula used in the code for the third case is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
```python
int(((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2) + a * (n - (b - a)))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used in the third case.

Correctness: **False**
