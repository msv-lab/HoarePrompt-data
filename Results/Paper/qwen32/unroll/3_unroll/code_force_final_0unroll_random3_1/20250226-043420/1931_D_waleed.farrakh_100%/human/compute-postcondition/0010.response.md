Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), two integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and a list of integers `arr` of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided output description.**
