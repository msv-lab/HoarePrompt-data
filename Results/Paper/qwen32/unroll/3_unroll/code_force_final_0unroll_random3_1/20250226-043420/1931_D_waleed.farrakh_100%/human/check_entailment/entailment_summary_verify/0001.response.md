### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the logic and correctness of the provided program, focusing particularly on `func_1` and how it counts beautiful pairs.

#### Key Observations:
- For a pair `(a_i, a_j)` to be beautiful:
  - `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0`
  - `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`

#### Modulo Properties:
- For the first condition: `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` can be rewritten using modulo properties as `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0`. This implies that `a_i % x` and `a_j % x` must be complementary remainders modulo `x` (i.e., if `a_i % x = r`, then `a_j % x = (x - r) % x`).
- For the second condition: `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0` simplifies to `a_i % y == a_j % y`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` pairs.
- For each element `a` in the array:
  - It calculates `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`, which ensures `rx` is the complementary remainder to `a % x` modulo `x`.
  - It calculates `ry = a % y`.
  - It checks if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of `(rx, ry)` to the count of beautiful pairs.
  - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The calculation of `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` is correct for finding the complementary remainder modulo `x`.
- The logic for checking if `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq` and adding the frequency to the count is correct.
- The frequency dictionary `freq` is updated correctly for each element in the array.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic:
- The program uses `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` to find the complementary remainder, which is correct for the first condition.
- But when checking for beautiful pairs, it should check for the exact pair `(rx, ry)` that matches the complementary remainder and the same modulo `y` value.
- The program does this correctly by checking if `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
