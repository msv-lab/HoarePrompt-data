The code snippet reads a chunk of input data and splits it into lines, storing the result in the variable `data`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet. The `input` variable, which was initially a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, is now assigned the result of `input().splitlines()`, which is a list of strings, each representing a line from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `input` is a list of strings where each string is a line from the input.**
