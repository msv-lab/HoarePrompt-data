The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 2n inclusive. It prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, the number of cliques (which is the ceiling of `n / k`), and a list of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.
