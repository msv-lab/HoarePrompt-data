### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a time string in the format "hh:mm". The program then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to determine the equivalent 12-hour format and whether the time is AM or PM. 

The conversion logic is as follows:
- If the hour is between "01" and "11", it is directly converted to the 12-hour format with "AM".
- If the hour is "12", it remains "12" with "PM".
- If the hour is between "13" and "23", it is converted to the equivalent hour in the 12-hour format (by subtracting 12) with "PM".
- If the hour is "00", it is converted to "12" with "AM".

The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as "00:00" converting to "12:00 AM" and "12:00" converting to "12:00 PM". The minutes remain unchanged throughout the conversion process.

### Correctness:
The program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
