### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to convert times from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with AM/PM. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" and converts it accordingly.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Splitting**: The line `h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))` is incorrect because `input().split(':')` will split the string into two parts, but `map(str, ...)` is unnecessary since the split parts are already strings. The correct line should be `h, m = input().split(':')`.

2. **Redundant Code**: The code contains repetitive conditional statements for each hour from '00' to '23'. This can be simplified by using arithmetic operations to convert the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

3. **Handling Leading Zeros**: The program does not handle the leading zeros correctly for hours from 1 to 9 in the 12-hour format. For example, it should print "01" instead of "1".

4. **AM/PM Assignment**: The assignment of AM/PM is correct, but it can be simplified.

Here is a simplified and corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = input().split(':')
        h = int(h)
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'AM'
        elif 1 <= h <= 11:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h - 12
            time = 'PM'
        
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m} {time}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the original program as provided is not correct. Therefore:

**Correctness: False**
