Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The triangle inequality theorem must be satisfied, which states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

The program, however, calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks where at least two of them are the same, which is unrelated to forming a non-degenerate triangle. Additionally, the program does not check the triangle inequality condition for any combination of three sticks.

Given the problem's requirements and the annotated program's functionality, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
