The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 10^3. For each test case, it prints a specific sequence of pairs of integers. The sequence starts with '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it continues with '2 3'. Otherwise, it continues with '2 4' followed by 'j j' for each integer `j` from 4 to `n`.
