`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The precondition for `n` in each of the `t` test cases remains valid, but since `t` has been updated, we need to reflect that in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**
