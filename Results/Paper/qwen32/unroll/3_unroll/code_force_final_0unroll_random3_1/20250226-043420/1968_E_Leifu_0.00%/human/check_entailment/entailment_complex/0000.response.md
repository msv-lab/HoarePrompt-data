### Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The provided program outputs a specific set of points for each test case.

Let's analyze the program's output strategy:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The points are `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1\}\), which has size 1. This is optimal for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The points are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: 1.
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`: \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\).
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)`: \(|1-2| + |2-3| = 2\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which has size 3. This is optimal for \(n = 3\).

3. **For \(n \geq 4\)**:
   - The points are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for \(j = 4\) to \(n\).
   - The Manhattan distances include:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: 1.
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\).
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\).
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(j, j)`: \(|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)\).
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(j, j)`: \(|1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1)\) or \(2(j-2)\) depending on \(j\).
     - Between `(2, 4)` and `(j, j)`: \(|2-j| + |4-j| = 2|j-3|\).
   - This strategy aims to generate a variety of Manhattan distances but does not guarantee the optimal set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). For example, the output for \(n = 5\) and \(n = 6\) in the problem example seems to be more optimal than what the provided program outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). For \(n = 5\) and \(n = 6\), the provided example outputs achieve a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances than the program's output.

**Correctness: False**
