Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the program only handles the cases for \( n = 2, 3, \) and \( n \geq 4 \) in a very limited way. Let's break down the issues:

1. **For \( n = 2 \):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - This is correct, as it achieves the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) which is 2.

2. **For \( n = 3 \):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - This is also correct, achieving a maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) which is 4.

3. **For \( n \geq 4 \):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     5 5
     ...
     n n
     ```
   - This strategy does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For larger values of \( n \), a different strategy is needed to ensure that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances are achieved.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, a more strategic placement of points is required. One effective strategy is to place the points in a way that they span the grid in a manner that generates the most unique distances. For example, placing points in a spiral pattern or along the diagonals can help achieve this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
