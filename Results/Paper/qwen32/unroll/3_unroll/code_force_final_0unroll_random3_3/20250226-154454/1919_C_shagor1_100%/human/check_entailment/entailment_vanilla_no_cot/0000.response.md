Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences optimally. The core idea is to maintain two variables `la` and `lb` that represent the last elements of the two subsequences `s` and `t`, respectively. The algorithm iterates through the array and decides whether the current element should be added to the subsequence ending with `la` or `lb`, or if it should start a new subsequence (which increases the penalty by 1). This approach ensures that the penalty is minimized.
