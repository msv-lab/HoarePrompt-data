The function accepts a tuple `args` containing any type and value of arguments. It returns the value associated with `args` in the dictionary `d` if `args` is already a key in `d`. If `args` is not in `d`, it computes `func(*args)`, stores the result in `d` with `args` as the key, and then returns the computed value.
