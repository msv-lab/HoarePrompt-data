n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. A is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. D is a sorted list of unique integers derived from a list of m integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. F is a list of k integers such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
