In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `testcases`, which is derived from the return value of the function `func_3()`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `testcases`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute if `testcases` is greater than 0.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `testcases` is greater than 0.
2. The value of `testcases` is determined by the return value of `func_3()`.
3. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not used within the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `testcases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**
