The given Python code snippet assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` to the variables `left` and `right`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `A` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique values returned by `func_4()`. `F` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`. `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`. `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`. `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found. `left` is `A[index - 1]`. `right` is `A[index]`.**
