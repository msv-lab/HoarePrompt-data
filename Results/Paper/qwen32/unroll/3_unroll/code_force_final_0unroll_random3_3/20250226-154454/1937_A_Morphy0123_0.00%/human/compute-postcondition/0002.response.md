To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code within the loop. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The first line of input is read and stored in `n_cases`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` is read.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - If `n` is 1, the output is `1`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the code calculates the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` and prints `2` raised to that power.

3. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates `n_cases` times, processing each test case as described above.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - After processing all test cases, the only variables that have changed are `i` (the loop counter) and `n` (the current test case value).
   - The variable `power` is recalculated for each test case and does not persist beyond the current iteration.
   - The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged after the loop completes.

The final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing all iterations is:

- `i` will be equal to `n_cases` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n_cases - 1`).
- `n` will be the value of the last test case processed.
- `power` will be undefined or the value from the last iteration, but it is not relevant to the output state.

The output state is described by the printed values for each test case, which are determined by the logic inside the loop.

Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases, and the output consists of the printed values for each test case based on the logic provided. The variable `i` is equal to `n_cases`, and `n` is the value of the last test case processed.**
