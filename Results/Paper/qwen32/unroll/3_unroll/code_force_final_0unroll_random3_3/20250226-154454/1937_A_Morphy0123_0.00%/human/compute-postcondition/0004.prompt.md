You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function accepts no arguments but reads input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: - After processing all test cases, the only variables that have changed are `i` (the loop counter) and `n` (the current test case value).
    #   - The variable `power` is recalculated for each test case and does not persist beyond the current iteration.
    #   - The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged after the loop completes.
    #
    #The final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing all iterations is:
    #
    #- `i` will be equal to `n_cases` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n_cases - 1`).
    #- `n` will be the value of the last test case processed.
    #- `power` will be undefined or the value from the last iteration, but it is not relevant to the output state.
    #
    #The output state is described by the printed values for each test case, which are determined by the logic inside the loop.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, the function reads a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of an array `a`. The function does not accept any arguments directly. The function returns nothing explicitly, but it is implied that it processes each `n` and could potentially output results based on the processing of each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
