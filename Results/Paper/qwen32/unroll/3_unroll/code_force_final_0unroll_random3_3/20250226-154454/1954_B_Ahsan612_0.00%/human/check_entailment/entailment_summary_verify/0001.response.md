Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.

### Key Points:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing the specified operation.
2. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array consists of identical elements, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer should be `-1`.
   - If there are segments of different elements, the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the smallest segment.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Iterating through each test case.
2. For each array, it counts the length of consecutive segments of identical elements.
3. It keeps track of the smallest segment length (`minn`).
4. If the smallest segment length is infinite (i.e., the array has only one segment of identical elements), it outputs `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it outputs the smallest segment length.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**: The program correctly handles arrays with a single element by initializing `minn` to `inf` and updating it only when it encounters different segments. Since there is no segment change in a single-element array, `minn` remains `inf`, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
2. **Logic for Determining `minn`**: The logic for determining the smallest segment length is correct. The program iterates through the array, counts segments, and updates `minn` accordingly.
3. **Initialization of `minn`**: The initialization of `minn` to `inf` is correct, ensuring that if no segment changes are found, the program outputs `-1`.

### Function Summary:
The function summary accurately describes the program's behavior: it calculates and prints the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements in the list `a`. If no such subarray exists (i.e., the array is uniform), it prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It correctly identifies when an array is uniform (and thus outputs `-1`) and correctly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make a non-uniform array non-beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
