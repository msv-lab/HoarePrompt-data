To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the purpose of the given loop and how it processes each test case.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. The goal is to find the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `ar` that contains only identical elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's execution for each test case:

1. Initialize `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of `ar`, and `minn` to positive infinity.
2. Iterate through the list `ar` starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, increment `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, update `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, reset `same` to 1, and update `num` to the current element.
3. After the loop, update `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last contiguous subarray.
4. If `minn` is still positive infinity (which would mean the list was empty, but it is guaranteed not to be), print -1. Otherwise, print `minn`.

The output for each test case is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of identical elements in the given list `ar`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state variables (`same`, `num`, `minn`, `i`) are reinitialized for each test case, the final output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements for each test case.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements for each test case.**
