### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, analyzing the given array to find the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements. If such a subarray is found, the length of that subarray is considered the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt the beautiful property of the array. If no such subarray is found (which theoretically shouldn't happen given the problem constraints), the program outputs -1.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. The program is not correctly identifying the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it is finding the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements and assuming that removing all elements of that subarray will make the array non-beautiful. This is not always true. The removal of elements should be evaluated in a way that ensures the array cannot be transformed into an array of all identical elements using the allowed operation.

For example, consider the test case:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program would identify the subarray `[5]` as the smallest subarray of identical elements and output `1`. However, removing a single `5` does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` can still be made into an array of all identical elements by repeatedly applying the allowed operation.

The correct approach would involve more complex logic to ensure that the removal of elements disrupts the beautiful property of the array. The program does not implement such logic, and thus, it does not correctly solve the problem.
