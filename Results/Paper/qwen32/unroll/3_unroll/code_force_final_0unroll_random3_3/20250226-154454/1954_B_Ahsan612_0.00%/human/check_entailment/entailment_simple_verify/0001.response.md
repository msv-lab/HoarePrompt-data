### Reasoning:
Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can have all its elements made identical through a specific operation.

#### Key Points Recap:
1. **Beautiful Array**: An array where you can make all elements the same using the specified operation.
2. **Objective**: Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Arrays with all identical elements (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`) should return `-1` because removing any element still leaves a beautiful array.
   - Arrays with segments of different elements should return the length of the smallest segment.

#### Program Analysis Recap:
The program:
1. Iterates over each test case.
2. For each array, counts the lengths of consecutive segments of identical elements.
3. Tracks the smallest segment length (`minn`).
4. If `minn` remains `inf` (indicating all elements are the same), it outputs `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

#### Annotated Code Walkthrough:
- **Initialization**: `same` is initialized to 1, `num` to the first element, and `minn` to `inf`.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates through the array, counting consecutive identical elements.
- **Segment Update**: When a different element is found, it updates `minn` with the length of the previous segment and resets `same`.
- **Final Update**: After the loop, it ensures `minn` is updated with the last segment.
- **Output**: If `minn` is `inf`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `minn`.

#### Evaluation:
- **Single Element Arrays**: The program correctly handles single-element arrays by initializing `minn` to `inf` and updating it as needed. If the array has only one element, `minn` remains `inf`, and it correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Multiple Elements**: The logic for counting segments and finding the smallest segment length is correct. If there are segments of different elements, the smallest segment length is correctly identified and returned.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles arrays with all identical elements by outputting `-1`, which aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make a beautiful array non-beautiful. It handles edge cases appropriately, including single-element arrays.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
