Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` made up of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The function processes each string and returns a result for each test case. If the string contains question marks, they are treated as wildcard characters that can be any lowercase Latin letter. The function returns the number of distinct strings that can be formed by replacing each question mark with any lowercase Latin letter, considering all possible replacements.**
