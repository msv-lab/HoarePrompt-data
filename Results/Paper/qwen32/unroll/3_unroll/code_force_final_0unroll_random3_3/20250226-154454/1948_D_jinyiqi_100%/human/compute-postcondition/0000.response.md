The code snippet converts the input string `s` into a list of its characters. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range and `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks for each of the `t` test cases.

After executing the code `s = list(input())`, the string `s` is transformed into a list where each element is a character from the original string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, and the total length of all strings s across all test cases does not exceed 5000.**
