There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interactively query up to 3n times per test case by providing indices a, b, c, and d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to receive a comparison result of (p_a | p_b) versus (p_c | p_d). The goal is to determine any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized among all pairs (0 ≤ i, j < n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
