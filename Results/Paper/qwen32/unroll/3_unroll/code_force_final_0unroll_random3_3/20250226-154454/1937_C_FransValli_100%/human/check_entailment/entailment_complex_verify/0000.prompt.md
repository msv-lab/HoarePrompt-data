You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interactively query up to 3n times per test case by providing indices a, b, c, and d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to receive a comparison result of (p_a | p_b) versus (p_c | p_d). The goal is to determine any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized among all pairs (0 ≤ i, j < n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

    #State: the indices `maxi` and `mini` are printed such that `p_maxi ⊕ p_mini` is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines and prints two indices `i` and `j` for each test case such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized among all pairs `(0 ≤ i, j < n)` for a given permutation `p` of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. It achieves this by interactively querying up to `3n` times per test case, comparing specific pairs of indices based on bitwise OR operations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The provided program aims to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. The program does not guarantee that it will always find such indices correctly for all possible permutations \(p\).

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Selection of `maxi` and `mini`:**
   - The program selects `maxi` as the index with the maximum value in the permutation by comparing pairs of the form `(maxi, maxi, i, i)`. This approach is flawed because it only checks if the bitwise OR of the same index with itself is less than the bitwise OR of the same index with another index. This does not necessarily identify the index with the maximum value in the permutation.
   - Similarly, `mini` is selected by comparing pairs of the form `(mini, mini, item, item)`, which also does not correctly identify the index with the minimum value in the permutation.

2. **Logic for finding the maximum XOR:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR operation. The XOR operation between two numbers is maximized when the numbers have the most differing bits. The provided program does not ensure that it finds such a pair.

3. **Potential for incorrect results:**
   - Given the flawed logic for selecting `maxi` and `mini`, the program can easily return incorrect indices for certain permutations. For example, if the permutation is such that the maximum value is not identified correctly, the XOR operation may not yield the maximum possible value.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior
Consider the permutation \(p = [0, 3, 1, 2]\).

- The program will first try to find `maxi` by comparing pairs `(maxi, maxi, i, i)`. If `maxi` starts as 0, the comparison `? 0 0 1 1` will return `=`, and `? 0 0 2 2` will return `=`, and `? 0 0 3 3` will return `=`, so `maxi` remains 0.
- Next, it will try to find `mini` by comparing pairs `(maxi, arr[0], maxi, i)`. The comparison `? 0 0 0 1` will return `>`, so `arr` becomes `[1]`. The comparison `? 0 0 0 2` will return `>`, so `arr` becomes `[2]`. The comparison `? 0 0 0 3` will return `>`, so `arr` becomes `[3]`.
- Then, it will try to find `mini` by comparing pairs `(mini, mini, item, item)`. The comparison `? 3 3 3 3` will return `=`, so `mini` remains 3.
- Finally, it will output `! 0 3`, which is incorrect because the maximum XOR is actually between indices 3 and 2, giving \(p_3 \oplus p_2 = 2 \oplus 1 = 3\).

Thus, the program does not always find the correct indices that maximize the XOR operation, making it incorrect.
