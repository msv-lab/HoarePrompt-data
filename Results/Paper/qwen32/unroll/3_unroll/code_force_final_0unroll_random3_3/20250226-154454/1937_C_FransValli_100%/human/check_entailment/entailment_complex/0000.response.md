### Reasoning:
The goal of the program is to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that the bitwise XOR \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The strategy used in the program involves interactive queries to gather information about the permutation \(p\).

1. **Finding `maxi`**:
   - The program starts by initializing `maxi` to 0.
   - It then iterates through all indices from 1 to \(n-1\), querying the comparison between \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{maxi}}\) and \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates `maxi` to \(i\). This effectively finds an index `maxi` such that \(p_{\text{maxi}}\) is likely to be among the largest values in the permutation \(p\).

2. **Finding Candidates for `mini`**:
   - The program initializes `arr` with `[0]`.
   - It iterates through all indices from 1 to \(n-1\), querying the comparison between \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{arr[0]}}\) and \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_i\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `arr` to `[i]`. If the result is `=`, it appends \(i\) to `arr`. This step is intended to find indices that, when XORed with \(p_{\text{maxi}}\), yield a potentially large result.

3. **Finding `mini`**:
   - The program initializes `mini` to the first element of `arr`.
   - It iterates through the remaining elements in `arr`, querying the comparison between \(p_{\text{mini}} \mid p_{\text{mini}}\) and \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to \(i\). This step is intended to find the smallest value among the candidates in `arr`, which when XORed with \(p_{\text{maxi}}\), maximizes the XOR result.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` such that \(p_{\text{maxi}} \oplus p_{\text{mini}}\) is maximized.

The strategy seems sound and aims to find a pair of indices that maximize the XOR value through a series of interactive queries. Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the provided program appears to be correct.
