Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each round. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of additional problems is flawed. The program sums up the difference between `m` and the count of each problem type, but this does not account for the fact that each round needs one of each problem type 'A' to 'G'. 

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
The bank already contains one problem of each difficulty level, so no additional problems are needed.

**Actual Output:**
```
6
```
The program incorrectly calculates that 6 additional problems are needed, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would be to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. If there are fewer than `m` problems of any particular difficulty level, the difference should be added to the total number of additional problems needed. However, the current implementation incorrectly sums up the differences for all problem types, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
