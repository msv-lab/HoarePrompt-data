Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for the corresponding values of `a`, `b`, and `m` read from the input for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` retain their last assigned values from the input, but the primary output is the series of printed results.**
