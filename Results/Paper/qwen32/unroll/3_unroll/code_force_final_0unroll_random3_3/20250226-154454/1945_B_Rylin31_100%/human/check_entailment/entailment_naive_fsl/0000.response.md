Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The current implementation simply adds up the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the overlaps between the intervals of visibility of fireworks launched by both installations. Specifically, we need to find the number of distinct times within the range `[0, m]` where fireworks are visible from either or both installations.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The current implementation calculates `m // a + m // b + 2`, which counts the number of fireworks launched by each installation and adds 2. This does not account for overlaps in visibility intervals.
2. **Overlap Handling**: Fireworks launched by both installations can overlap in visibility intervals, and these overlaps need to be counted only once.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `a` and `b` are very large or where `m` is very large, which can lead to incorrect results due to the way intervals are counted.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as using the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of distinct visibility intervals.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        count_a = m // a + 1
        count_b = m // b + 1
        count_ab = m // lcm_ab + 1
        max_fireworks = count_a + count_b - count_ab
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to handle the overlap in visibility intervals.
- We count the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the range `[0, m]`.
- We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to avoid double-counting the fireworks that are visible from both installations.

This corrected version should handle all edge cases and provide the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
