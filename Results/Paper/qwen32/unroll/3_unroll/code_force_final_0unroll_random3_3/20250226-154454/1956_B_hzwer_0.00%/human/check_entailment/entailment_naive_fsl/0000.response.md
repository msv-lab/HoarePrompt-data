Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The `func_1` function attempts to use dynamic programming to solve the problem, but the implementation has several issues:

1. **Initialization**: The initialization of the `dp` array is incomplete and does not consider all necessary initial conditions.

2. **Counting Cards**: The `cards.count(j + 1)` operation is inefficient and will result in a Time Limit Exceeded error given the constraints (up to 200,000 cards).

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transitions in the dynamic programming table do not correctly represent the optimal strategies for both players. Specifically, the transitions do not account for the fact that Nene will play optimally to minimize your score after maximizing her own.

4. **State Representation**: The state representation in the dynamic programming table (`dp[i][j]`) is not clearly defined in terms of what it represents, which makes it difficult to verify the correctness of the transitions.

5. **Base Cases**: The base cases for the dynamic programming table are not correctly set up to handle all possible scenarios.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate where the program might fail:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- You have cards 1, 2, 3.
- Nene has cards 1, 2, 3.
- You play card 1. No points.
- Nene plays card 1. No points.
- You play card 2. No points.
- Nene plays card 2. No points.
- You play card 3. No points.
- Nene plays card 3. No points.
- You score 0 points, and Nene scores 0 points.

The provided program might not handle this scenario correctly due to the issues mentioned above, leading to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
