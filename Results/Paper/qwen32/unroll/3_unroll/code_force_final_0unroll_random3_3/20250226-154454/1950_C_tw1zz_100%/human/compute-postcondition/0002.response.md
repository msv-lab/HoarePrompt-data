Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 1440). For each of the `t` test cases, it accepts a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 representing the hour, and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59 representing the minute. The function returns the time of day classification for each test case: "morning" if the time is from 05:00 to 11:59, "afternoon" if the time is from 12:00 to 17:59, "evening" if the time is from 18:00 to 21:59, and "night" if the time is from 22:00 to 04:59.**
