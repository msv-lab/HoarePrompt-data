You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format "hh:mm". It then prints the time converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for most cases, but it has a few issues that can lead to incorrect outputs:

1. **Leading Zeros in Minutes**: The program does not handle leading zeros in the minutes correctly. For example, if the input is `09:05`, the program will output `09:5 AM` instead of `09:05 AM`. This is because `m` is not being formatted to always have two digits.

2. **Edge Cases for Hours**: The program correctly handles most hours, but it could be simplified and made more robust. For example, the conversion logic can be simplified using modular arithmetic.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output formatting is mostly correct, but due to the issue with minutes, it can produce incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        period = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h1 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m:02} {period}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minutes are always printed with two digits and handles the conversion of hours correctly.
