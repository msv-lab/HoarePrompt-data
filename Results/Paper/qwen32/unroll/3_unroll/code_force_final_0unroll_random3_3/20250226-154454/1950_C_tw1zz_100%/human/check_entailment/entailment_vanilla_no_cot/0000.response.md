Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly converts each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and appends the appropriate "AM" or "PM" suffix. It handles all edge cases, such as times at the start and end of the day (e.g., "00:00" and "12:00"). The output format matches the problem description, and the leading zeroes are preserved as required.
