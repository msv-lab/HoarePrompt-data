The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a corresponding string of directions ('L' and 'R'). For each test case, it calculates a list where each element represents the product of the remaining integers in the list after sequentially removing elements based on the directions, modulo two given values. The result for each test case is printed as a space-separated list of integers.
