To determine the output state after executing the loop for all test cases, we need to understand the behavior of the code within the loop for each test case and how it affects the output.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the code reads integers `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, a list `p` of length `n`, and a list `a` of length `n`.
2. **Path Construction**:
   - For Bodya (`pb`), it constructs a path by following the pointers in list `p` starting from `pb` until a cycle is detected. The values from list `a` corresponding to the nodes in this path are stored in `pathb`.
   - Similarly, for Sasha (`ps`), it constructs a path by following the pointers in list `p` starting from `ps` until a cycle is detected. The values from list `a` corresponding to the nodes in this path are stored in `paths`.
3. **Score Calculation**:
   - For each path, the code calculates the maximum possible score by considering the sum of values in the path weighted by the number of steps remaining (`k - i`).
   - The score for Bodya is stored in `resb` and for Sasha in `ress`.
4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The code compares the scores `resb` and `ress` and prints "Bodya" if `resb` is greater, "Sasha" if `ress` is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

Since the code processes each test case independently and the output for each test case is printed immediately after processing, the state of the variables at the end of all iterations is not cumulative but specific to the last test case processed.

Given that the state of the variables after each test case is not retained for subsequent test cases, the final output state would be the state after processing the last test case.

Let's assume the last test case has the following values:
- `n = 5`, `k = 3`, `pb = 1`, `ps = 2`
- `p = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
- `a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

For this last test case, the paths would be:
- For Bodya (`pb = 1`), the path is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1` (cycle detected), so `pathb = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.
- For Sasha (`ps = 2`), the path is `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2` (cycle detected), so `paths = [20, 30, 40, 50, 10]`.

The scores would be calculated as:
- For Bodya: 
  - `i = 0`: `curr = 0 + 10 * 3 = 30`, `preb = 10`, `resb = 30`
  - `i = 1`: `curr = 10 + 20 * 2 = 50`, `preb = 30`, `resb = 50`
  - `i = 2`: `curr = 30 + 30 * 1 = 60`, `preb = 60`, `resb = 60`
- For Sasha:
  - `i = 0`: `curr = 0 + 20 * 3 = 60`, `pres = 20`, `ress = 60`
  - `i = 1`: `curr = 20 + 30 * 2 = 80`, `pres = 50`, `ress = 80`
  - `i = 2`: `curr = 50 + 40 * 1 = 90`, `pres = 90`, `ress = 90`

Since `ress > resb`, the output for the last test case is "Sasha".

Thus, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Since we are only interested in the state after the last test case, and assuming the last test case results in "Sasha", the output state would be:

Output State: **Sasha**.
