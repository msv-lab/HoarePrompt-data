The loop head in the provided code snippet is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable that can be adjusted is the value that `input()` returns, which will be converted to an integer and used as the range for the loop. This value determines how many times the loop will execute.

To ensure the loop executes, the value returned by `input()` must be a positive integer. Given the context, this value corresponds to `t`, the number of test cases. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
