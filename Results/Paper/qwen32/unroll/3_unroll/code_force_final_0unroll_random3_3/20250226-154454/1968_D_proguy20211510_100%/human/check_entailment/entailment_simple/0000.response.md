### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` as integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program detects the cycles for both Bodya and Sasha starting from their initial positions using a visited array `vis`.
   - For Bodya, it appends the values from `a` corresponding to the positions in the cycle to `pathb`.
   - For Sasha, it appends the values from `a` corresponding to the positions in the cycle to `paths`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each cycle, the program calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by Bodya and Sasha.
   - It iterates through the cycle and calculates the score for each possible number of turns up to `k`.
   - For each turn `i`, it calculates the score as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for Bodya and similarly for Sasha.
   - It keeps track of the maximum score in `resb` for Bodya and `ress` for Sasha.

4. **Comparison:**
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares `resb` and `ress`.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `resb > ress`, "Sasha" if `ress > resb`, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Correctness:
The program seems to correctly implement the solution by detecting cycles, calculating scores, and comparing them. The logic for cycle detection and score calculation appears to be sound based on the problem description.

However, there is a minor issue in the annotated state comment at the end of the program. It states `#State: Sasha`, which seems to be irrelevant and does not affect the correctness of the program's logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct with respect to the problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
