You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: Sasha
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their paths defined by `p` and values defined by `a`, with up to `k` steps allowed. It then prints the name of the player with the higher score, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not handle the case where the players enter a cycle in the permutation and the number of turns `k` is very large. Specifically, the code does not account for the possibility of a cycle and how to efficiently compute the score in such cases.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Cycle Handling**: The code correctly identifies the cycles for both players by appending scores until a position is revisited. However, it does not handle the cycle efficiently when `k` is large. For example, if `k` is much larger than the length of the cycle, the player can repeat the cycle multiple times, and the score should be computed accordingly.

2. **Cycle Scoring**: The current implementation calculates the score until the cycle is detected, but it does not extend this calculation to account for multiple cycles if `k` is larger than the cycle length. This means that the scores might be underestimated if `k` is large.

3. **Efficiency**: The code's current approach is to sum up the scores for each turn until a cycle is detected. However, if `k` is very large, this approach can be inefficient and may not handle the constraints properly.

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 1000000000 1 2
2 3 4 1
1 2 3 4
```
In this case, both players are in a cycle of length 4. The scores for each turn are:
- Bodya: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
- Sasha: 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, ...

Since `k` is very large, both players will repeat their cycles multiple times. The correct approach would involve calculating the total score for one complete cycle and then multiplying it by the number of complete cycles within `k` turns, and adding the remaining scores for the partial cycle.

### Correct Approach:
To handle this efficiently, the code should:
1. Detect cycles for both players.
2. Calculate the total score for one complete cycle.
3. Determine how many complete cycles fit into `k` turns.
4. Calculate the remaining score for the partial cycle if `k` is not a multiple of the cycle length.
5. Compare the total scores for both players.

Given these issues, the current implementation is not correct for all potential cases, especially when `k` is very large. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
