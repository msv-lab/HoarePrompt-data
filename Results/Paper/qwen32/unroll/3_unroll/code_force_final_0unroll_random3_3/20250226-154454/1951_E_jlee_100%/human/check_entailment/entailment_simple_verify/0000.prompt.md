You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when it comes to partitioning strings that contain palindromic substrings. Let's analyze the given code and identify a potential issue.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Single Character Strings**: The code correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings and returns "NO".
2. **Strings with Different Start and End Characters**: If the first and last characters are different, the code returns the entire string as a partition, which is correct since it cannot be a palindrome.
3. **Strings with Repeated Characters**: If all characters in the string are the same, it correctly returns "NO" since every substring will be a palindrome.
4. **Strings with Almost All Characters the Same**: The code checks if all but one character are the same and handles this case appropriately.
5. **General Case**: The code iterates through the string to find the first non-matching character from the start and end. If found, it partitions the string at that point. However, there are some edge cases where this logic might fail.

### Potential Issue:
Consider the string "abacaba". This string cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings because every possible partition will include at least one palindrome (e.g., "aba", "aca", "aca", etc.). However, the current logic in the code might incorrectly partition this string.

### Test Case:
Let's test the string "abacaba":

- Input:
  ```
  1
  abacaba
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output from the Program:
  ```
  YES
  1
  abacaba
  ```

The program incorrectly identifies "abacaba" as a valid partition, which is incorrect because "abacaba" is a palindrome.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when the entire string is a palindrome or when it can only be partitioned into palindromic substrings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
