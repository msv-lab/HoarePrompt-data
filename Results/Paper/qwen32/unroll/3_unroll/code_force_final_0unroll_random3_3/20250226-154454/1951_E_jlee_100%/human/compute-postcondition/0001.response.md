To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t)`, so the variables of interest are `i` and `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: This variable represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. According to the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), so this condition is inherently satisfied. No adjustment is needed for `t` itself.

2. **Variable `i`**: This variable is the loop index, which is automatically initialized by the `range` function in Python. When the loop starts, `i` will be 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

Given these observations, the state before the loop starts already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, and neither needs to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0 (automatically initialized by the loop)**

However, since the problem statement specifies the initial state of `t` and does not require us to adjust `i` (as it is automatically managed by the loop), we can simply state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
