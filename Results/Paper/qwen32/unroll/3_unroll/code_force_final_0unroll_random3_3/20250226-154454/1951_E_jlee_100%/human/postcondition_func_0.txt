The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it determines if it can be split into one or two substrings such that all characters in each substring are identical. If possible, it outputs 'YES' followed by the number of splits and the resulting substrings. If not, it outputs 'NO'. The input values `t` and `s` remain unchanged after processing.
