The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `t`. Given that the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the execution of this code will replace the initial value of `t` with the new input value, which is also expected to be a positive integer within the same range.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
