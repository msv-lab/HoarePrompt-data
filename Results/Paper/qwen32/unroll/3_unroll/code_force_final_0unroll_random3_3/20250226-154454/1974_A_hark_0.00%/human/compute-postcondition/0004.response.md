Functionality: **The function `func_3` processes a number of test cases specified by the user input `t` (where `1 <= t <= 10^4`). For each test case, it calls `func_2` to perform some unspecified processing. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; instead, it outputs results based on the processing of each test case.**
