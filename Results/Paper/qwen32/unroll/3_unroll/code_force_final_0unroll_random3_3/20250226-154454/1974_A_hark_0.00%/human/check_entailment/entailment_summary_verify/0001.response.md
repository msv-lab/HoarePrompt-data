### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is not used anywhere in the code, so it is indeed redundant. However, its presence does not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed, as highlighted in the original assessment. Specifically:
     - **Calculation of `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`**: This line is incorrect. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in those remaining cells.
     - **Calculation of `bxsfory1`**: This logic is also incorrect. It should correctly compute the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function correctly processes the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case.

### Corrected Approach:
The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the number of screens needed for the `y` 2x2 icons.
2. Calculating the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Calculating the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of `func_2`:
```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    screens_for_y = math.ceil(y / 2)
    cells_used_by_y = y * 4
    total_cells_used = screens_for_y * 15
    remaining_cells = total_cells_used - cells_used_by_y
    remaining_x = x - remaining_cells
    if remaining_x > 0:
        screens_for_x = math.ceil(remaining_x / 15)
    else:
        screens_for_x = 0
    print(screens_for_y + screens_for_x)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

### Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified that `func_2` has flawed logic and provided a corrected version. The original program does not correctly compute the minimum number of screens needed, especially when placing the 2x2 and 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_2`.

**Final: False**
