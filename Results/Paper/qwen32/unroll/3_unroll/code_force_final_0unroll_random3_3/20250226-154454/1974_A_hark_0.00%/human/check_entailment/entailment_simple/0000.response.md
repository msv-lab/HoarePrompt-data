Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided comments.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of 5x3 grids (screens) required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons. Each 5x3 grid can hold up to 15 1x1 icons or up to 2 2x2 icons (since a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are only 15 cells in a 5x3 grid).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Returns the smaller of two integers `a` and `b`. This function is not used anywhere in the program.
2. `func_2()`: Reads two integers `x` and `y` from input, calculates the minimum number of screens required, and prints the result.
3. `func_3()`: Reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, calls `func_2()`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2()`:
- **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
  - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. The intention might be to adjust `x` after placing the 2x2 icons, but the formula is incorrect. The correct approach would be to calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
  - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons. The `+1` is incorrect because it adds an extra screen even if the remaining space is zero.
  - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens required.

- **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**
  - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.

- **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**
  - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons.

- **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
  - `print(0)`: This correctly outputs 0 screens required.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues in the logic for handling cases where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The formula for adjusting `x` and the calculation for `bxsfory1` are incorrect. This means that the program does not always produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic of `func_2()`, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
