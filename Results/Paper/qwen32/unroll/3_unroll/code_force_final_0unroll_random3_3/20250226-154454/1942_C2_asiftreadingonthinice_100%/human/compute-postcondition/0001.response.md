The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop will execute `tt` times, where `tt` is the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` distinct integers are part of the loop body and not the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `tt` is at least 1, as the loop will iterate `tt` times. The state of `tt` is already given as 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts that ensures the loop will execute is simply the given condition for `tt`.

State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4**
