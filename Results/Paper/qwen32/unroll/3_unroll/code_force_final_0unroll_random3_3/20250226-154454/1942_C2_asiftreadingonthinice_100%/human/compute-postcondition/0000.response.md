Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. Additionally, the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

Explanation: The variable `tt` is assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
