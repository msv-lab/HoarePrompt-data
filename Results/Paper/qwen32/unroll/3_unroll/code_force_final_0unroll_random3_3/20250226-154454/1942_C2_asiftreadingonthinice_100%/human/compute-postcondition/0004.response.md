Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` that represents the maximum number of vertices Bessie can reach, considering the constraints and the chosen vertices. The final state of the program is a series of printed values, each corresponding to the result of a test case.**
