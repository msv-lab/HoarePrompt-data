Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded sum. The issue lies in the logic of how the program assigns values to the three letters of the word. It does not ensure that the smallest possible letters are chosen first, which is necessary to achieve the lexicographically smallest word.

Here's a brief explanation of the problem with the code:

1. The program attempts to distribute the encoded sum (`lex`) across three positions in `arr`.
2. It incorrectly handles the distribution by checking if the remaining sum is less than or equal to 26 and then assigning either 1 or 26, which does not guarantee the smallest possible letters.
3. The sorting step at the end does not correct the issue because the initial distribution might already have assigned larger values to the first positions.

A correct approach would involve starting with the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then adjusting the third letter to match the encoded sum, ensuring that the word remains lexicographically smallest.
