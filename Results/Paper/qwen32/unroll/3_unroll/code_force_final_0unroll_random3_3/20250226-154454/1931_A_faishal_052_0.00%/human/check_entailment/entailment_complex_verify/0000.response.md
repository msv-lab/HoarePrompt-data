### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word such that the sum of the positions of its letters in the alphabet equals `n`.
- The letters are indexed from 1 ('a') to 26 ('z').

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it processes the integer `lex` (the encoded word) to determine the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word.

Here is the provided program with annotations:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

#### Annotations Recap:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and initializes an empty list `arr`.
- It then enters a loop that runs twice, appending either 1 or 26 to `arr` based on the value of `lex`.
- After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
- The list `arr` is then sorted.
- Finally, it prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Distribution of Sum**:
   - The program incorrectly distributes the sum `lex` into three parts.
   - It first tries to append `1` or `26` to the list `arr` and then appends the remaining value of `lex`.
   - This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` after distribution, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The sorting step can disrupt the order which is crucial for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, especially when the sum `lex` is close to the maximum possible value (78).

#### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increase them while ensuring the sum matches `lex`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest letters
        a = b = c = 1
        # Distribute the remaining sum
        remaining = lex - 3
        # Increment the letters in the order a, b, c
        if remaining > 0:
            a += min(remaining, 25)
            remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
            if remaining > 0:
                b += min(remaining, 25)
                remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
                if remaining > 0:
                    c += remaining
        print(chr(a + 96), chr(b + 96), chr(c + 96))

func()
```

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The provided program does not correctly distribute the sum `lex` into three parts to form the lexicographically smallest word.
- It incorrectly handles the distribution and sorts the parts, which can lead to incorrect results.
- The corrected approach ensures that the letters are incremented in the correct order to maintain the lexicographical order.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis and the identified issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**.
