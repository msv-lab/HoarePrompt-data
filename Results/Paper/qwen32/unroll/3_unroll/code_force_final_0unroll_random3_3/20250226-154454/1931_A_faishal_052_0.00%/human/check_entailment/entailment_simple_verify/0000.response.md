### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`, where `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

#### Program Analysis

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

#### Annotations Recap
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and processes it to form a list `arr` of three elements.
- The program appends values to `arr` based on the value of `lex` and then sorts `arr` before printing the corresponding characters.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Logic for Distributing the Sum**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the distribution of the sum `lex` into three parts.
   - It first tries to append `1` or `26` to the list `arr` and then appends the remaining value of `lex`.
   - This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` after distribution, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The sorting step can disrupt the order which is crucial for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, especially when the sum `lex` is close to the maximum possible value (78).

#### Correct Approach

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increase them while ensuring the sum matches `lex`.

#### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest letters
        a = b = c = 1
        # Distribute the remaining sum
        remaining = lex - 3
        # Increment the letters in the order a, b, c
        if remaining > 0:
            a += min(remaining, 25)
            remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
            if remaining > 0:
                b += min(remaining, 25)
                remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
                if remaining > 0:
                    c += remaining
        print(chr(a + 96), chr(b + 96), chr(c + 96))

func()
```

#### Evaluation Using Annotations

Let's use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment:

1. **First Iteration (lex = 24)**:
   - The program appends `26` twice and then `2` (since `24 - 52 < 0`, it appends `24 - 26 = -2 + 26 = 2`).
   - After sorting, the list becomes `[1, 2, 26]`.
   - The output is `aav` (incorrect, should be `aaa`).

2. **Second Iteration (lex = 70)**:
   - The program appends `26` twice and then `18` (since `70 - 52 = 18`).
   - After sorting, the list becomes `[18, 26, 26]`.
   - The output is `rzz` (correct).

3. **Third Iteration (lex = 3)**:
   - The program appends `1` three times.
   - After sorting, the list remains `[1, 1, 1]`.
   - The output is `aaa` (correct).

4. **Fourth Iteration (lex = 55)**:
   - The program appends `26` twice and then `3` (since `55 - 52 = 3`).
   - After sorting, the list becomes `[3, 26, 26]`.
   - The output is `czz` (correct).

5. **Fifth Iteration (lex = 48)**:
   - The program appends `26` twice and then `6` (since `48 - 52 < 0`, it appends `48 - 26 = 22`, then `22 - 26 < 0`, it appends `22 - 26 + 26 = 6`).
   - After sorting, the list becomes `[6, 26, 26]`.
   - The output is `auz` (correct).

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly find the lexicographically smallest word for all cases due to the incorrect distribution logic and unnecessary sorting.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**.
