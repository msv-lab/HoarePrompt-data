### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that corresponds to a given sum of positions in the alphabet. The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads an integer representing the sum of the positions of the three letters.

The logic of the program is as follows:
1. For each test case, it initializes an empty array `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
2. It reads the encoded integer `lex`.
3. It then enters a loop that runs twice. In each iteration, it checks the value of `lex`:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is less than 52 but greater than 26, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
   - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
4. After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
5. It sorts the array `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
6. It then converts each value in `arr` to its corresponding character and prints them.

However, there are issues with this approach:
- The logic for assigning values to `arr` is incorrect. For example, the program does not correctly handle cases where `lex` is such that the smallest possible letters should be used.
- The sorting step is unnecessary if the values are assigned correctly in the first place.
- The program does not handle the edge cases properly, especially for the smallest possible sums.

Let's consider a correct approach:
- For a given sum `n`, the smallest lexicographical word can be constructed by starting with the smallest possible letters.
- The program should try to use as many 'a's (position 1) as possible, then 'b's (position 2), and so on, until the sum is reached.

### Correctness:

Given the issues with the current logic, the program is not correct for all test cases. For example, for an input of `3`, the correct output should be `aaa`, but the current program will not produce this output correctly.

**Correctness: False**
