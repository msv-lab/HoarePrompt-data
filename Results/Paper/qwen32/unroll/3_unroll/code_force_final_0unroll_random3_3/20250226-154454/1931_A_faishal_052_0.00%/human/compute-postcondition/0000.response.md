The code snippet `cases = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78 for each test case. However, `cases` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is introduced by this line of code.

The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is still described by its initial constraints. The new variable `cases` is assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` is an input integer.**
