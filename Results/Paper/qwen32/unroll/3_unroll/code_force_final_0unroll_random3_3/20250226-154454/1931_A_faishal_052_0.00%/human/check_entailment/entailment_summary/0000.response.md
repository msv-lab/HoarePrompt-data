Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it constructs the lexicographically smallest word. The program attempts to construct the word by first filling the first two positions with the maximum possible values (26) and then using the remaining value for the third position. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting word will be the smallest lexicographically.

For example, consider the input `24`. The program would try to fill the first two positions with `26` each, but since `24` is less than `52`, it will fill the first two positions with `1` and then use the remaining value `22` for the third position, resulting in the word `aav`. This is correct in this case, but it does not generalize well.

However, there are cases where this approach will fail to produce the correct result. For instance, for the input `55`, the program will fill the first two positions with `26` each and then use the remaining value `3` for the third position, resulting in the word `zzc`. This is not the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded as `55`. The correct word should be `czz`.

The correct approach should be to start with the smallest possible values for the first two positions and then use the remaining value for the third position. This ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest.

Correctness: **False**
