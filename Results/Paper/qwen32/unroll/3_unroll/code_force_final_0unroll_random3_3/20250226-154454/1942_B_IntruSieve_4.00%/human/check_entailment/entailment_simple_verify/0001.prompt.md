You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- We are given `a` and need to construct `p` based on the above relationship.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `mex` as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, which is used to track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, which is not used in a meaningful way in the program and can be ignored for this analysis.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the given array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
   - The logic for handling positive and non-positive `arr[i]` values seems incorrect based on the problem's requirement.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Issues with the Program:
- The program does not correctly calculate the permutation `p` based on the given `a` array.
- The use of `minn` and the handling of positive and non-positive `arr[i]` values do not align with the problem's requirements.
- The program does not ensure that each number from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in `p`.
- The program does not correctly compute `MEX` for each prefix of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.
2. For each `a_i`, compute the `MEX` of the current permutation `p`.
3. Determine `p_i` as `MEX + a_i`.
4. Ensure that `p_i` is a valid number (i.e., within the range 0 to `n-1` and not already used).
5. Add `p_i` to the permutation and mark it as used.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to construct the permutation `p` based on the relationship between `a` and `MEX`.
