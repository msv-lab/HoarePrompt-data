The given code snippet is a simple `print()` statement without any arguments. In Python, when `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs a newline character.

Given the initial state, we have the following variables and their descriptions:
- `mex`: a list of n integers.
- `minn`: an integer.
- `maxx`: an integer reflecting the maximum absolute difference encountered.
- The integers in the list `mex` have been printed to the console, separated by spaces.

Since the `print()` statement in the code snippet does not contain any arguments, it will simply print a newline character.

Output: **(newline)**
