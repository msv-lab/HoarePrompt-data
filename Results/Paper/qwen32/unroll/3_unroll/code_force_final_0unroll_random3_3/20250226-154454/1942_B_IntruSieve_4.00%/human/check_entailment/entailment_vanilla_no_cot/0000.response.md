Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). The logic for determining the MEX value and constructing the permutation needs to be more precise.

Let's analyze the problem and the program:

### Problem Analysis:
- **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a list of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list.
- **Permutation Construction**: Given the array \( a \), we need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

### Program Analysis:
- The program tries to construct \( p \) by iterating through the array \( a \) and determining the next element of \( p \) based on the current MEX and the value of \( a_i \).
- However, the logic for maintaining the MEX and the values in \( p \) is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the relationship between \( a_i \) and \( p_i \).

### Correct Approach:
- We need to maintain a set of numbers that have been used in the permutation so far.
- For each \( a_i \), we calculate the MEX of the current set, and then determine \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX} - p_i \).
- We need to ensure that \( p_i \) is a valid number (i.e., it hasn't been used before and it satisfies the equation).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_mex(used):
    mex = 0
    while mex in used:
        mex += 1
    return mex

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = set()
    p = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        mex = find_mex(used)
        p_i = mex - a[i]
        used.add(p_i)
        p.append(p_i)
    
    print(" ".join(map(str, p)))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation \( p \). Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
