You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The code attempts to calculate the `mex` values but does not correctly map the values of `a` to the corresponding permutation `p`.

Let's examine the logic in the code:

1. The code reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes `mex` as an empty list and `minn` and `maxx` as 0.
4. It iterates through the array `a`:
   - If `a[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
   - If `a[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
5. Finally, it prints the `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**: The `mex` value is not correctly calculated. The `mex` value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`. The code does not maintain a set of used numbers to determine the `mex` value correctly.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**: The code incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when `a[i]` is non-positive. It should be based on the current `mex` value and the value of `a[i]`, but the logic is flawed.
3. **No Proper Set Management**: The code does not maintain a set of numbers that have already been used in the permutation `p`, which is necessary to correctly calculate the `mex` value.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Code Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

In this example, the code does not correctly construct the permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`. The output `0 1 2 3 4` does not match the expected output `0 1 4 2 3` because the `mex` values are not calculated correctly.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
