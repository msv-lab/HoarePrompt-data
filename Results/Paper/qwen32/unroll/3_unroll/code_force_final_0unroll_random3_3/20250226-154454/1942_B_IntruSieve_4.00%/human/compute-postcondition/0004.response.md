The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `maxx`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0.**
