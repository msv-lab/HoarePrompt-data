The given loop processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then checks if the integer `1` is present in the list. If `1` is present, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". The variables `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` are local to each iteration of the loop and do not persist after the loop completes a single iteration. The variable `t` is the number of test cases and remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

After all iterations, the only variable that remains in its initial state is `t`, while the variables `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` do not retain any specific values as they are reinitialized in each iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; no other variables from the loop body are retained.**
