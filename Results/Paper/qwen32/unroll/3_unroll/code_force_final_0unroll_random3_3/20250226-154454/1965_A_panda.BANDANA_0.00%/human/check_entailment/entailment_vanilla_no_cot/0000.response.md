Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play of the game. The current implementation only checks if there is a pile with 1 stone and assumes Bob wins in that case, and Alice wins otherwise. However, the game's outcome is determined by the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the piles, not just the presence of a pile with 1 stone.

The correct strategy involves calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR-sum of the pile sizes is zero, Bob wins (because Alice will always be able to respond to Alice's moves in such a way that the XOR-sum remains zero, eventually forcing Alice into a losing position). If the XOR-sum is non-zero, Alice wins (because she can always make a move that sets the XOR-sum to zero, putting Bob in a losing position).

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = 0
        for num in l:
            xor_sum ^= num
        if xor_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This program calculates the XOR-sum of the pile sizes and correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
