Precondition: **k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.**

Note: The function definition provided (`def func_1(k, a, b, n):`) does not match the problem description, as `k` should be determined within the function, not passed as an input. The correct function definition based on the problem description would be `def func_1(n, a, b):`.
