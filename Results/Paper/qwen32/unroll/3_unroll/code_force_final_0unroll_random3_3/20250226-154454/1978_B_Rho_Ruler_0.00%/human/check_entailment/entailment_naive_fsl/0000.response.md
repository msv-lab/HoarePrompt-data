Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns.

The main issue is that the program is using a binary search to find the maximum `k` such that `ans <= n * max(a, b)`, but this condition does not necessarily maximize the profit.

The function `func_1` calculates the total revenue for a given `k`, but it does not actually compute the profit. The profit should be calculated as the sum of the revenue from the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price, and then compared with the maximum possible profit.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def max_profit(n, a, b):
    max_profit = 0
    for k in range(n + 1):
        profit = sum(b - i for i in range(k)) + a * (n - k)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
    return max_profit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max_profit(n, a, b))
```

This code correctly calculates the profit for each possible value of `k` and finds the maximum profit.

However, the original code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum profit, hence it is incorrect.
