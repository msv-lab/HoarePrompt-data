Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect for the problem described. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function and how the binary search is being used to determine the maximum profit. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the profit for a given `k`. Instead, it checks if the total price of selling `k` buns at the modified price plus the remaining buns at the usual price is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which does not make sense in the context of maximizing profit.

The correct approach should be to calculate the actual profit for each possible `k` and determine which `k` yields the maximum profit. The binary search should be used to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit, not to check an arbitrary condition.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function and the main logic:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        low = 0
        high = min(n, b)
        max_profit = 0

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            # Calculate profit for selling mid buns at modified price and the rest at usual price
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, mid + 1)) + (n - mid) * a
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        print(max_profit)
```

In this corrected version, the profit is calculated directly for each `mid` value, and the maximum profit is tracked. The binary search is used to find the `k` that maximizes the profit.

Correctness: **False**
