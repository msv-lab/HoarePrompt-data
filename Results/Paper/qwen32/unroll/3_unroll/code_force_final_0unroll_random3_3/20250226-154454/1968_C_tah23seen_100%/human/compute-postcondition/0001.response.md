The code snippet provided assigns the value `n - 2` to the variable `i`. Given the initial state, the values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only variable that gets updated is `i`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and the length of `arr` is n-1; `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is `10`; `i` is `n - 2`.**
