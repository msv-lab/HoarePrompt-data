Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the input. It then determines and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either the integer `i` does not appear in the list, or `i` appears exactly once in the list and there are already at least two other integers that each appear exactly once.**
