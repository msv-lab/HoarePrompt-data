You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The array a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `N` is an integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of `N` integers (0 ≤ `a_i` < `N`), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value `0` and contains the frequency of each integer in the list `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: the smallest integer `i` where either `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` becomes 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to see if it meets the requirements and correctly calculates the MEX score under optimal play by Alice and Bob.

### Problem Understanding
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and removing them.
- Alice tries to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- Bob tries to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy Analysis
- Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice will try to introduce elements that increase the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent this.
- The key insight is that the MEX of `c` will be determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not included in `c` after all elements are moved from `a` to `c`.
- If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it can be strategically placed by Alice to ensure that the MEX is at least `i+1` (by placing it at the end of her turns).
- If any integer appears more than once, Bob can prevent it from contributing to the MEX by pairing it with another occurrence, ensuring that the MEX is less than or equal to the first integer that appears only once or is missing.

### Solution Breakdown
- The solution uses a `defaultdict` to count occurrences of each integer in `a`.
- It then iterates through integers from `0` to `N` (inclusive) to find the first integer that either appears zero times or appears exactly once.
- The first integer that meets this condition is returned as the MEX.

### Correctness Verification
- The logic correctly identifies the smallest integer that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
- The solution handles all edge cases, including:
  - Arrays where all elements are the same.
  - Arrays where elements are unique.
  - Arrays with a mix of unique and repeated elements.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly calculates the MEX score under optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

Reasoning: The solution correctly identifies the smallest integer that either does not appear in the array or appears exactly once, which determines the MEX score under optimal play by both players.
