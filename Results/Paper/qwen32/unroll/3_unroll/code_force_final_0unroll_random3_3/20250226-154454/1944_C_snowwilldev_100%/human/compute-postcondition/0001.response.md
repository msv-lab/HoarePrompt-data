The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components into an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The value of `N` remains unchanged as it was initially assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`N` is an integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of `N` integers (0 ≤ `a_i` < `N`)**.
