In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common convention in Python to indicate that the loop variable is intentionally unused. The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`.

Since `_` is not used in the loop body, we don't need to adjust its state. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, it is already guaranteed to be in a range that will allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. The state before the loop starts is already sufficient.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
