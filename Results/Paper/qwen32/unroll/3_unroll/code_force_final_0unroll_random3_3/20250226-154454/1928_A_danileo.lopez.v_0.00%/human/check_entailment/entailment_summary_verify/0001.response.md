### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the given program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Bob starts with a rectangle of size `a x b`.
- He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- The two resulting rectangles must be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original rectangle (considering that two rectangles are the same if one can be obtained by rotating the other).

**Key Observations:**
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. 
  - If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a `b x a/2` rectangle.
  - If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form an `a x b/2` rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, any cut will result in two rectangles of size `a x (b-1)/2` or `(a-1)/2 x b`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions because the resulting dimensions will always be equivalent to the original rectangle up to rotation.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes", indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No".

**Function Summary:**
- The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the program: it outputs 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd.

**Validation:**
- The logic in the program aligns with the problem's requirements and the key observations made.
- The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement, including when `a` and `b` are both odd, and when either `a` or `b` is even.

**Conclusion:**
- The original assessment is correct. The program correctly determines whether another rectangle can be formed based on the observations above.

### Final: **True**
