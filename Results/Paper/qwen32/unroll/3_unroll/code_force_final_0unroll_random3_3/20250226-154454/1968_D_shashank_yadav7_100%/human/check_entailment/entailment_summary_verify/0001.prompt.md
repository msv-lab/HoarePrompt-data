You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum accumulated values for two entities, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', and prints the name of the entity with the higher accumulated value, or 'Draw' if they are equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - It initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha (`bp` and `sp`) with the value of `a` at their starting positions.
   - It also initializes `bm` and `sm` to be the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, if they stayed in their initial positions for all `k` turns.

4. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by adding the value of `a` at their new positions.
   - It updates `bm` and `sm` to be the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, considering the best move (stay or move) at each turn.

5. **Determine the Winner:**
   - After the simulation, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are the same.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Logic for Maximum Possible Scores (`bm` and `sm`):**
  - The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` is flawed. The program calculates `bm` and `sm` as the maximum possible scores if they stayed in their initial positions for all `k` turns, which is not correct.
  - The program should simulate the game correctly and keep track of the scores for each player after each move.

- **Simulation Loop:**
  - The simulation loop should correctly update the scores for each player after each move.
  - The loop should correctly handle the case when `k` is large, as the game should only simulate up to `k` turns.

### Corrected Logic:

- The program should simulate the game for `k` turns and keep track of the scores for each player after each move.
- The program should not precompute `bm` and `sm` as the maximum possible scores if they stayed in their initial positions for all `k` turns.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly simulate the game and does not correctly determine the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
