Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

The program is supposed to simulate the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha for `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads the following:
- `n`: length of the permutation
- `k`: number of turns
- `P_B`: Bodya's starting position
- `P_S`: Sasha's starting position
- `p`: permutation array
- `a`: array of scores

The program then calculates the scores for both players after `k` turns and determines the winner.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initialization**: The starting positions are decremented by 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
2. **Score Calculation**: The initial scores are set based on the starting positions.
3. **Simulation of Moves**: The program simulates `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
4. **Comparison of Scores**: After `k` turns, the program compares the scores and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Potential Issues to Look For:
- **Correctness of Position Updates**: The program should correctly update the positions based on the permutation array.
- **Correctness of Score Updates**: The program should correctly accumulate the scores based on the current positions.
- **Handling of Large `k`**: The program should handle the case where `k` is very large efficiently.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as `k=1`, `P_B = P_S`, etc.

### Code Review:
- **Initialization**: `b -= 1` and `s -= 1` correctly convert the starting positions to 0-based indexing.
- **Score Calculation**: `bp` and `sp` are initialized with the scores at the starting positions.
- **Simulation of Moves**: The loop runs `k` times, updating the positions and scores:
  - `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` correctly update the positions.
  - `bp += a[b]` and `sp += a[s]` correctly accumulate the scores.
- **Comparison of Scores**: The final comparison is correct and prints the appropriate result.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **`k=1`**: The program correctly handles this case by only performing one iteration.
- **`P_B = P_S`**: If both start at the same position, the scores will be compared correctly after `k` turns.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. It handles the updates of positions and scores correctly and efficiently, even for large values of `k`. The edge cases considered also seem to be handled appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
