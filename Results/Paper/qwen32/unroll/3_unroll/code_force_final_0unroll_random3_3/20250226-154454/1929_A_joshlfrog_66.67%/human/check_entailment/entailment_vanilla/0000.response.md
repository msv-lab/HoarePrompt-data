Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when arranged in a specific order. Specifically, the beauty is given by:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

Thus, to maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning. This means the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) elements, and then calculating the difference `x - y`. This aligns with the optimal strategy derived from the problem analysis.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the length of the array `l`.
   - Read the array elements into the list `nums`.
   - Initialize `x` to 0 (which will store the maximum element).
   - Initialize `y` to 100000000 (which will store the minimum element).
   - Iterate through the array:
     - Update `x` to the maximum of `x` and the current element.
     - Update `y` to the minimum of `y` and the current element.
   - Print the difference `x - y`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements in the array and computes their difference, which is the maximum possible beauty of the array. The initialization of `y` to 100000000 is safe because all input values are between 1 and \(10^9\), so the minimum value in any array will be less than or equal to 100000000.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
