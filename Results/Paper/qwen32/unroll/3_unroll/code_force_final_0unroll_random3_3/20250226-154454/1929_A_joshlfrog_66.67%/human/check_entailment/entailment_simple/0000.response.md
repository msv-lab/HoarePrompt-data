Reasoning:  
The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The beauty of the array can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. In such an arrangement, the beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array because all intermediate differences will cancel out except for the first and last elements.

The given program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements of the array and prints their difference for each test case. This is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array, as arranging the array in ascending or descending order will result in the maximum difference between the first and last elements.

Thus, the program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
