Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of an array, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is specified at the beginning of the input. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided array elements.**
