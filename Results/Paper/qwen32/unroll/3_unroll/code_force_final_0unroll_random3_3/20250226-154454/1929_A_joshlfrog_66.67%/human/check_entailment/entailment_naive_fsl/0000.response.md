Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. The given program, however, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

For example, consider the test case:
```
2
3
1 3 2
3
3 1 2
```
The expected output should be:
```
2
2
```
However, the provided program will output:
```
2
2
```
which is incorrect for the second test case. The correct output for the second test case should be `1` (when the array is sorted as `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]`).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of consecutive differences. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of consecutive differences, which is the correct approach.
