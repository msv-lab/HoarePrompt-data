You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when arranged in a specific order. Specifically, the beauty is given by:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

Thus, to maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning. This means the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) elements, and then calculating the difference `x - y`. This aligns with the optimal strategy derived from the problem analysis.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the length of the array `l`.
   - Read the array elements into the list `nums`.
   - Initialize `x` to 0 (which will store the maximum element).
   - Initialize `y` to 100000000 (which will store the minimum element).
   - Iterate through the array:
     - Update `x` to the maximum of `x` and the current element.
     - Update `y` to the minimum of `y` and the current element.
   - Print the difference `x - y`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements in the array and computes their difference, which is the maximum possible beauty of the array. The initialization of `y` to 100000000 is safe because all input values are between 1 and \(10^9\), so the minimum value in any array will be less than or equal to 100000000.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
