### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and verifies that it correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated version and the problem description to ensure its correctness.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Calculation of `rx` and `ry`:**
   - The program calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which is equivalent to `(x - a % x) % x`. This is done to handle negative remainders correctly.
   - The program calculates `ry` as `a % y`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array, it checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it adds the count from `freq` to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - For a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful, `a_i + a_j` should be divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`.
   - This translates to `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` and `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0`.
   - The program correctly handles this by checking for pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx` is `(x - a_i % x) % x` and `ry` is `a_i % y`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Negative Remainders:** The program correctly handles negative remainders by adjusting `rx` to be non-negative.
   - **Multiple Occurrences:** The use of a dictionary to track frequencies ensures that multiple occurrences of the same pair are correctly counted.
   - **Large Inputs:** The program efficiently processes up to `2 * 10^5` elements per test case, which is within the given constraints.

### Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call in `func_2`:** 
  - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- **State After Parsing Input in `func_2`:**
  - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the parsed data for one test case.
- **State Before Returning Results in `func_1`:**
  - `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the count of previously seen pairs `(rx, ry)` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. The logic is sound, and the program handles all edge cases and constraints efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
