### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The function `func_2` handles input parsing and calls `func_1` to process each test case. The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given criteria.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.

2. **Loop through array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which is equivalent to `(x - a % x) % x` to handle negative remainders.
     - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, the count from `freq` is added to the total count of beautiful pairs.
     - The frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` is updated in `freq`.

3. **Verification of Logic**:
   - The program uses the properties of modular arithmetic to determine if pairs are beautiful:
     - For a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful, `a_i + a_j` should be divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`.
     - This translates to `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` and `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0`.
     - The program correctly handles this by checking for pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx` is `(x - a_i % x) % x` and `ry` is `a_i % y`.

4. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - **Negative Remainders**: The program correctly handles negative remainders by adjusting `rx` to be non-negative.
   - **Multiple Occurrences**: The use of a dictionary to track frequencies ensures that multiple occurrences of the same pair are correctly counted.
   - **Large Inputs**: The program efficiently processes up to `2 * 10^5` elements per test case, which is within the given constraints.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:

- The function reads input from standard input, parses it into a list of test cases, and then processes each test case using `func_1`.
- It correctly handles the input format and ensures that the results for each test case are printed.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
