You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and correctness of the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, specifically a type known as "Subtract a Fixed Number from Each Pile" game. In this game, the key to determining the winner is to analyze the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of such piles is odd, the first player (Alice) wins; otherwise, the second player (Bob) wins.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements. However, this function does not directly help in determining the winner of the game. It seems to be part of a different approach that might not be relevant to solving the problem efficiently.

### Analysis of `func_2`

The function `func_2` is intended to determine the winner based on the number of piles and the stones in each pile. It uses recursion to determine the winner for a reduced set of piles (`a[1:]`). Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Base Case for 1 Pile**: If there is only one pile, Alice wins because she can take all the stones.
2. **Base Case for 2 Piles**: If there are two piles and the number of stones in the first pile is even, Alice wins because she can always mirror Bob's moves. If the number of stones in the first pile is odd, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced into a losing position.
3. **Recursive Case**: For more than two piles, the function recursively determines the winner for the remaining piles (`a[1:]`). It then checks the result of this recursive call:
   - If the next player to move (`winNext`) is Bob (i.e., `winNext == 2`), Alice wins.
   - If the next player to move is Alice (`winNext == 1`) and the current pile has more than one stone (`a[0] != 1`), Alice can force a win.
   - Otherwise, Bob wins.

### Correctness of the Program

The logic in `func_2` is not correctly implemented for solving the problem. The correct approach to determine the winner is to count the number of piles with an odd number of stones and check its parity. The provided `func_2` does not follow this approach and instead uses a more complex and incorrect recursive logic.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def determine_winner(piles):
    odd_count = sum(1 for stones in piles if stones % 2 != 0)
    return "Alice" if odd_count % 2 != 0 else "Bob"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        piles = list(map(int, input[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        results.append(determine_winner(piles))
        index += 1 + n
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
