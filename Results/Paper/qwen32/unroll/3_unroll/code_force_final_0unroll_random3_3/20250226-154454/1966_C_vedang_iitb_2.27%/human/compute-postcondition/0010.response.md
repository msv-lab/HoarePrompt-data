Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, excluding the first pile; `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n - 1 <= len(a) - 1, and n - 1 is not equal to 0 or 1; `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. The current value of `winNext` is either 2 or (1 and the first element of `a` is not 1).**
