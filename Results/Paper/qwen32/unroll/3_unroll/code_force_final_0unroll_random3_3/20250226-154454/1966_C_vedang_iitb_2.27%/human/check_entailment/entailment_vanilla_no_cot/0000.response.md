Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules given. The program consists of two functions, but neither of them correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game.

- **func_1**: This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements. This transformation does not help in determining the winner of the game.

- **func_2**: This function attempts to recursively determine the winner but does so incorrectly. The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` do not follow the game rules. For example, if there is only one pile, the first player (Alice) wins if the pile has an odd number of stones, and loses if the pile has an even number of stones. The recursive case also does not correctly propagate the game state or determine the winner.

The correct approach to solving this problem involves using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. If the Nim-sum of the sizes of the piles is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, piles in test_cases:
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        if nim_sum != 0:
            results.append("Alice")
        else:
            results.append("Bob")
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]),
    (2, [1, 7]),
    (7, [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]),
    (3, [1, 2, 3]),
    (6, [2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4]),
    (8, [5, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 3, 2]),
    (1, [1000000000])
]

print(determine_winner(t, test_cases))
```

This implementation calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
