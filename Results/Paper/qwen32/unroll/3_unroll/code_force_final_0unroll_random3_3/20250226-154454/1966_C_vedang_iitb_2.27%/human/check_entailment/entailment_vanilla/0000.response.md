To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and correctness of the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, specifically a type known as "Subtract a Fixed Number from Each Pile" game. In this game, the key to determining the winner is to analyze the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of such piles is odd, the first player (Alice) wins; otherwise, the second player (Bob) wins.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements. However, this function does not directly help in determining the winner of the game. It seems to be part of a different approach that might not be relevant to solving the problem efficiently.

### Analysis of `func_2`

The function `func_2` is intended to determine the winner based on the number of piles and the stones in each pile. It uses recursion to determine the winner for a reduced set of piles (`a[1:]`). Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Base Case for 1 Pile**: If there is only one pile, Alice wins because she can take all the stones.
2. **Base Case for 2 Piles**: If there are two piles and the number of stones in the first pile is even, Alice wins because she can always mirror Bob's moves. If the number of stones in the first pile is odd, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced into a losing position.
3. **Recursive Case**: For more than two piles, the function recursively determines the winner for the remaining piles (`a[1:]`). It then checks the result of this recursive call:
   - If the next player to move (`winNext`) is Bob (i.e., `winNext == 2`), Alice wins.
   - If the next player to move is Alice (`winNext == 1`) and the current pile has more than one stone (`a[0] != 1`), Alice can force a win.
   - Otherwise, Bob wins.

### Correctness of the Program

The logic in `func_2` is not correctly implemented for solving the problem. The correct approach to determine the winner is to count the number of piles with an odd number of stones and check its parity. The provided `func_2` does not follow this approach and instead uses a more complex and incorrect recursive logic.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def determine_winner(piles):
    odd_count = sum(1 for stones in piles if stones % 2 != 0)
    return "Alice" if odd_count % 2 != 0 else "Bob"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        piles = list(map(int, input[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        results.append(determine_winner(piles))
        index += 1 + n
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
