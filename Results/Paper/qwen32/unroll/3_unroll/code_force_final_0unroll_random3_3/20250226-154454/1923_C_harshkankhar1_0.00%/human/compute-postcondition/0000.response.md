Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `q` are now the integers read from the input, satisfying the conditions 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. The list `c` and the queries `l_i` and `r_i` remain as per the initial state since they are not modified by the given code snippet.
