To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, we need to understand the structure and values of the list `a` based on the given initial state.

1. **Initialization of `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers.
   - `a[i]` is defined as the cumulative sum of `a[0]` to `a[i]`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - Typically, cumulative sum arrays start with `a[0] = 0` (or another base value), and the subsequent elements are the sum of the previous elements and the corresponding element from another list (often the input list).
   - However, in this case, `a` is defined differently and is not directly tied to `c` (the list of integers). The description does not specify the initial value of `a[0]`, but commonly, cumulative sum arrays start with `a[0] = 0`.

3. **Given Information**:
   - The problem does not provide specific values for `n`, `c`, or the initial value of `a[0]`.
   - We can infer that `a[0]` is likely `0` based on common practices in cumulative sum calculations.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - Let's assume `a[0] = 0` (a common starting point for cumulative sums).
   - For simplicity, assume `c` is a list of positive integers, and the cumulative sum is calculated based on some rule or another list `a` itself.

5. **Output Description**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
   - Since the exact values of `c` and the initial value of `a[0]` are not provided, we can only describe the structure of `a`.

Given the information, the output will be a sequence of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` (assuming the common starting point for cumulative sums), and the subsequent elements are the cumulative sums based on the definition provided.

Since the exact values of `a` are not specified, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **0, a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (where a[i] is the cumulative sum of a[0] to a[i])**
