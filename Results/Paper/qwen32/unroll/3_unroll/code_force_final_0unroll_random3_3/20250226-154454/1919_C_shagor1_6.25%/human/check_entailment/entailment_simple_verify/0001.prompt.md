You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of size n . You will do the following process to
calculate your penalty:

  1. Split array a into two (possibly empty) subsequences^\dagger s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t^\ddagger . 
  2. For an array b of size m , define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1} . 
  3. The total penalty you will receive is p(s) + p(t) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained
from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

^\ddagger Some valid ways to split array a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (s,t) are
([3,4,1,5],[1]) , ([1,1],[3,4,5]) and ([\,],[3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,4,5],[1]) , ([3,1,4,1],[1,5]) and ([1,3,4],[5,1]) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\le n\le 2\cdot
10^5 ) — the size of the array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] .
The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 .

In the second test case, a possible way to split a is s=[8,3,1] and
t=[2,1,7,4,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1 .

In the third test case, a possible way to split a is s=[\,] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]
. The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to split the array into two subsequences such that the sum of penalties (number of increasing adjacent elements) of both subsequences is minimized.

### Program Analysis
The program uses two variables, `x` and `y`, to keep track of the smallest elements of the two subsequences being formed. The logic is to assign elements to one of the subsequences based on whether they are smaller than or equal to the current smallest element in that subsequence. If an element is larger than both `x` and `y`, it increments the penalty and updates `y`.

### Detailed Program Walkthrough
1. **Initialization**: `x` and `y` are initialized to `n + 1` (a value larger than any possible element in the array). `ans` is initialized to `0` to keep track of the penalty.
2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - If `a <= x`, it means `a` can be part of the subsequence with smallest element `x`. Update `x` to `a`.
     - Else if `a <= y`, it means `a` can be part of the subsequence with smallest element `y`. Update `y` to `a`.
     - Else (implying `a > x` and `a > y`), it means `a` is larger than both current smallest elements. This suggests that `a` cannot be added to either subsequence without increasing the penalty. Therefore, `y` is updated to `a` and `ans` (penalty) is incremented by `1`.
3. **Output**: After processing all elements, the program prints the accumulated penalty `ans`.

### Issues in the Program
The line `x == y` in the program is incorrect. It seems like the intention was to swap `x` and `y` when `a` is larger than both `x` and `y`. However, the correct operation should be `x, y = y, a` or `y = a` and `x = y` if we want to maintain the smallest elements correctly. But in this context, it should be simply `y = a` and increment `ans`.

### Corrected Logic
The logic should be:
- If `a <= x`, update `x`.
- Else if `a <= y`, update `y`.
- Else, increment `ans` and update `y`.

### Conclusion
The program has a bug in the logic where it should update `y` to `a` and increment `ans` when `a` is larger than both `x` and `y`, but it incorrectly uses `x == y` which does nothing. This results in incorrect penalties being calculated.
