To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the variables.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m < a and m < b:
        print(2)
    elif m < a and m > b:
        print(2 + m // b)
    elif m < b and m > a:
        print(2 + m // a)
    else:
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

Here's the breakdown of what happens in each iteration:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input.
- Depending on the relationship between `m`, `a`, and `b`, a specific value is printed.

The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are re-assigned in each iteration based on the input, and they do not retain their values across iterations. The variable `i` is the loop counter and is automatically managed by the `for` loop.

Since the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are re-assigned in each iteration, their final state after the loop is the state of the last iteration. However, the problem asks for the output state after all the iterations, which is a description of what gets printed, not the state of the variables themselves.

The output state after all the iterations is the series of printed values for each test case. Since the problem asks for the output state in the format "Output State: **output state.**", we can describe this as the sequence of printed values.

However, since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case are not provided, we can't list the exact printed values. Instead, we can describe the output state in terms of the logic applied in the loop.

Output State: **A series of printed values based on the logic: for each test case, if `m < a` and `m < b`, print `2`; if `m < a` and `m > b`, print `2 + m // b`; if `m < b` and `m > a`, print `2 + m // a`; otherwise, print `m // a + m // b + 2`.**
