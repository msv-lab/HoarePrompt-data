Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program is incorrect for several cases. It does not properly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations, especially when `m` is large compared to `a` and `b`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at the same time. This involves calculating the number of multiples of `a` and `b` that fall within the range of visibility for fireworks from the other installation.

Here is a more correct approach:

1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, denoted as `lcm(a, b)`.
2. For each installation, calculate how many fireworks are visible within the range `[0, lcm(a, b) + m]`.
3. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of fireworks that are visible at the same time.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        
        # Count fireworks from installation 1 in range [0, lcm_ab + m]
        count_a = (lcm_ab + m) // a
        
        # Count fireworks from installation 2 in range [0, lcm_ab + m]
        count_b = (lcm_ab + m) // b
        
        # Count fireworks from both installations in range [0, lcm_ab + m]
        count_both = (lcm_ab + m) // lcm_ab
        
        # Use inclusion-exclusion principle
        max_visible = count_a + count_b - count_both
        
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by considering the visibility ranges and overlaps of fireworks from both installations.
