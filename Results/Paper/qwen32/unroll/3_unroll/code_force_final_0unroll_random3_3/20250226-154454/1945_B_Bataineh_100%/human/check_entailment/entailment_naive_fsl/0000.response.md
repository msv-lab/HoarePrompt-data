Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect:

The given solution attempts to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time based on the conditions of `a`, `b`, and `m`. However, it does not accurately compute the number of overlapping fireworks for arbitrary values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Here's why the current solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Overlapping Fireworks**:
   - The logic in the code does not correctly account for the fact that fireworks from both installations can overlap in time. It incorrectly assumes that the number of fireworks visible at the same time can be determined by simple division and addition based on `m`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which is crucial for determining when fireworks from both installations will overlap.
   - It also does not handle cases where `a` and `b` are large relative to `m`, which could lead to incorrect counts of overlapping fireworks.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the code:

**Counterexample**:
```
Input:
1
2 3 5

Expected Output:
5

Explanation:
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times: 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
- Fireworks are visible for 6 minutes (from launch time to launch time + m).
- At time 6, fireworks from both installations are visible, and fireworks launched at times 2, 3, 4, and 5 are also visible.
- Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 5.
```

The provided code would not correctly compute this case, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one should:
1. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a certain time frame.
2. Determine the overlap of these fireworks using the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
3. Compute the maximum number of overlapping fireworks based on these calculations.

Given the complexity of the problem, a more sophisticated approach involving mathematical computations, such as the inclusion-exclusion principle, is required to handle all edge cases correctly.
