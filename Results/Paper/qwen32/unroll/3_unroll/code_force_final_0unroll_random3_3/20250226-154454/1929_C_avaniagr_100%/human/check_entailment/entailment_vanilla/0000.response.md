Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Sasha aims to determine if he can guarantee that he will eventually have at least `n` coins for any `n` by placing bets under the given rules. The key points are:
1. If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
2. If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
3. He can't lose more than `x` times in a row.
4. The bet amount `y` must be a positive integer and can't exceed his current number of coins.

### Strategy:
To ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins, he needs to be able to recover from any sequence of losses within the `x` consecutive loss limit and keep increasing his coins.

### Conditions for "YES":
1. If `x < k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to ensure he can recover from the worst-case scenario of `x` losses in a row.
2. If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins because the worst-case scenario requires one more coin to start the next cycle after `x` losses.
3. If `x > k - 1`, the logic is more complex. We need to calculate the minimum coins required to ensure Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario and keep increasing his coins. The provided code attempts this by iteratively calculating the required coins.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to implement the above logic:
- It first checks if `x < k - 1` and whether Sasha has enough coins (`a >= x + 1`).
- It then checks if `x == k - 1` and whether Sasha has enough coins (`a >= x + 2`).
- For `x > k - 1`, it calculates the minimum coins required through an iterative process.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the first test case:
- `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
  - Since `x < k - 1` is false and `x == k - 1` is true, it checks if `a >= x + 2` which is `7 >= 3`. This is true, so the output is "YES".

Let's verify the second test case:
- `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
  - Since `x < k - 1` is false and `x == k - 1` is true, it checks if `a >= x + 2` which is `1 >= 3`. This is false, so the output is "NO".

The provided code seems to implement the correct logic based on the problem description and the examples given. However, we need to ensure that the logic for `x > k - 1` is correct and handles all cases properly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly handle the conditions and logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, it seems to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
