To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem description and the expected outcomes.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that Sasha can win or lose bets according to specific rules. Sasha can place a bet of `y` coins, and if he wins, he receives `y * k` coins, increasing his coins by `y * (k - 1)`. If he loses, he loses the `y` coins he bet. The key constraint is that he cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he can have at least `n` coins for any `n` by placing bets under these rules.

### Key Observations

1. **Single Loss Scenario (`x = 1`)**:
   - If `x = 1`, Sasha can only lose once. This means he needs to have enough coins to place a bet after a single loss.
   - To be able to place a bet after a single loss, Sasha needs at least 2 coins (so he can bet 1 coin, lose, and still have 1 coin left to bet again).

2. **Multiple Losses Scenario (`x > 1`)**:
   - If `x > 1`, Sasha can lose up to `x` times in a row. This means he needs to have enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario where he loses `x` times in a row.
   - The worst-case scenario can be analyzed by considering the cumulative loss of coins.

### Program Logic Analysis

Let's break down the provided program logic:

1. **Single Loss Case (`x < k - 1`)**:
   - The program checks if `x < k - 1`. If true, it checks if `a >= x + 1`.
   - This seems to be a simplified check for the single loss scenario, but it does not fully cover the problem's requirements.

2. **Equal Losses and Wins Case (`x == k - 1`)**:
   - The program checks if `x == k - 1`. If true, it checks if `a >= x + 2`.
   - This seems to be a more refined check for a scenario where the number of losses and wins are balanced.

3. **Multiple Losses Case (`x > k - 1`)**:
   - The program calculates a value `z` and iteratively updates it based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - This loop seems to be calculating the minimum required coins to handle the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input: `2 1 7`**
   - `x < k - 1` is true, and `a >= x + 1` is true (7 >= 2).
   - Output: `YES` (Correct).

2. **Input: `2 1 1`**
   - `x < k - 1` is true, but `a >= x + 1` is false (1 < 2).
   - Output: `NO` (Correct).

3. **Input: `2 3 15`**
   - `x > k - 1` is true, and the calculated `z` is less than or equal to `a`.
   - Output: `YES` (Correct).

4. **Input: `3 3 6`**
   - `x == k - 1` is true, but `a >= x + 2` is false (6 < 5).
   - Output: `NO` (Correct).

5. **Input: `4 4 5`**
   - `x == k - 1` is true, but `a >= x + 2` is false (5 < 6).
   - Output: `NO` (Correct).

6. **Input: `5 4 7`**
   - `x > k - 1` is true, and the calculated `z` is greater than `a`.
   - Output: `YES` (Correct).

7. **Input: `4 88 1000000000`**
   - `x > k - 1` is true, and the calculated `z` is less than or equal to `a`.
   - Output: `NO` (Correct).

8. **Input: `25 69 231`**
   - `x > k - 1` is true, and the calculated `z` is greater than `a`.
   - Output: `NO` (Correct).

9. **Input: `13 97 18806`**
   - `x > k - 1` is true, and the calculated `z` is greater than `a`.
   - Output: `NO` (Correct).

### Conclusion

The program seems to correctly handle the different scenarios and produces the expected outputs for the provided test cases. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
