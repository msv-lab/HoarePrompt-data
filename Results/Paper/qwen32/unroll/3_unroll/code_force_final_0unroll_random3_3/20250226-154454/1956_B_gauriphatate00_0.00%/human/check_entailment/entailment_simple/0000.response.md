### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given the constraints and the behavior of Nene.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - You and Nene each have `n` cards, and each card has a number from 1 to `n`.
   - Each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck.
   - The goal is to maximize your score by placing cards on the table. You score a point if the card you place has already been placed on the table by either player.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The maximum number of points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have.
   - If you have `k` pairs, you can score at most `k` points because each pair can contribute at most one point to your score.
   - Nene, playing optimally, will try to prevent you from scoring points where possible, but the maximum points you can score is still limited by the number of pairs you have.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` calculates the number of pairs you have (`pairs`), i.e., the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - It then returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. The reason for `n // 2` is that you can have at most `n // 2` turns where you can potentially score a point (since you have `n` turns and each turn involves placing one card).

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - If you have `k` pairs, you can indeed score at most `k` points, because each pair can contribute at most one point.
   - The function correctly limits the score to `n // 2` because you can't score more points than the number of turns you have.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If you have no pairs (`pairs = 0`), you can't score any points.
   - If you have `n // 2` pairs, you can score up to `n // 2` points, which is the maximum you can achieve given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum number of points you can score, given the constraints and the optimal play by Nene. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
