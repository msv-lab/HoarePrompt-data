To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the code and understand the changes made to the variables in each iteration.

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `n`: A positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives.
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.
   - `input`: `sys.stdin.read` (not directly used in the loop, but part of the initial state).
   - `data`: A list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
   - `idx`: Initialized to 1.
   - `t`: The integer value of `data[0]` (number of test cases).
   - `results`: An empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
     - `idx` is incremented by 1.
     - `a` is updated to the list of integers from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]`.
     - `idx` is incremented by `n`.
     - The result of `func_1(n, a)` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output State after the Loop:**
   - `n`: Will be the value from the last iteration of the loop.
   - `a`: Will be the list from the last iteration of the loop.
   - `input`: Remains unchanged.
   - `data`: Remains unchanged.
   - `idx`: Will be the index after the last iteration, which is `idx` after the final increment.
   - `t`: Remains unchanged.
   - `results`: Will contain the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.

Output State: **`n` is the number of cards from the last test case, `a` is the list of cards from the last test case, `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is the index after processing all test cases, `t` is the number of test cases, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.**
