To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `t > 0`. The variable `t` is described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Given this range, `t` is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

Since `t` is already within a range that ensures `t > 0`, no adjustment is needed for `t`. Therefore, the state right before the loop can remain as it is.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
