Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. The program incorrectly assumes that if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, it means that sending 2 invitations is sufficient. This is not the correct condition to determine if sending 2 invitations will result in at least 2 friends coming to the party.

2. The program does not properly check for the minimum number of invitations needed. It should be checking for cycles in the best friend relationships and determining the smallest set of invitations that will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

3. The program prints `3` as the default answer if the condition for `2` invitations is not met, which is not always correct. There are cases where more than 2 but less than 3 invitations might be needed.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
- Analyze the best friend relationships to identify cycles.
- Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party based on these cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        visited = [False] * n
        components = []

        def dfs(v, component):
            while not visited[v - 1]:
                visited[v - 1] = True
                component.append(v)
                v = p[v - 1]
            return component

        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                component = dfs(i + 1, [])
                components.append(component)

        min_invitations = 0
        for component in components:
            if len(component) == 1:
                min_invitations += 2
            else:
                min_invitations += (len(component) + 1) // 2

        print(min_invitations)

func()
```

This corrected program uses depth-first search (DFS) to find cycles in the best friend relationships and calculates the minimum number of invitations needed based on the size of each cycle.
