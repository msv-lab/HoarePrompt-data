The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and `p` is a list of integers with specific properties. However, the code snippet only affects the variable `n` by reading a new value for it from the input. The other variables (`t` and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer read from the input; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i.**
