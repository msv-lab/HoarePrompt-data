### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior as described in the annotated version to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to perform a three-step operation exactly `n` times:
  1. Select an index `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ |a|`.
  2. Insert `a_i + i` into set `S`.
  3. Delete `a_i` from `a`.
- After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
- Construct array `b` as `S` sorted in decreasing order.
- Find the lexicographically largest `b` possible.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Transformation of Array `a`:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       a[i] += i + 1
   ```
   This step transforms each element `a_i` to `a_i + i + 1`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Counting and Sorting:**
   ```python
   counter = Counter(a)
   cur = 0
   a = list(set(a))
   a.sort(reverse=True)
   cnt = n - len(a)
   ans = []
   ```
   - `counter` keeps track of the frequency of each element in the transformed `a`.
   - `a` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted in descending order.
   - `cnt` represents the number of elements that need to be added to `ans` to reach the length `n`.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(a)):
       if i > 0:
           adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
           for j in range(adv):
               ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
           cnt -= adv
           cur -= adv
       ans.append(a[i])
       counter[a[i]] -= 1
       cur += counter[a[i]]
   for _ in range(cnt):
       ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
   ```
   - For each unique element in `a`, the program calculates how many additional elements can be inserted between consecutive unique elements to maximize the lexicographical order.
   - `adv` is the number of additional elements that can be inserted between `a[i-1]` and `a[i]`.
   - `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, and `cur` is updated to reflect the remaining count of the current element.
   - If there are still elements to be added (`cnt` > 0), the program appends additional elements in descending order to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```
   - The final array `ans` is printed, which should be the lexicographically largest `b`.

### Evaluation:

The program's approach is to first transform the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element, then sort the unique elements in descending order, and finally, fill in any gaps with additional elements to ensure the array `b` has length `n`.

The key point is whether this approach guarantees the lexicographically largest `b`. The program does the following:
- Transforms `a` correctly.
- Sorts the unique elements in descending order.
- Fills in gaps with additional elements to achieve the required length `n`.

However, the original assessment argues that the program does not guarantee the optimal selection of indices `i` to maximize the values in `S`. This seems to be a misunderstanding. The program does not explicitly select indices `i` but rather processes the transformed elements directly, which is correct.

The transformation `a_i + i + 1` ensures that higher indices contribute more to the value, and sorting the unique elements in descending order guarantees that the largest possible values are included first. The filling of gaps with additional elements ensures that the array `b` reaches the required length `n`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to produce the lexicographically largest `b` as per the problem requirements. The original assessment's concern about the optimal selection of indices `i` is not applicable here because the program directly processes the transformed elements.

**Final: True**
