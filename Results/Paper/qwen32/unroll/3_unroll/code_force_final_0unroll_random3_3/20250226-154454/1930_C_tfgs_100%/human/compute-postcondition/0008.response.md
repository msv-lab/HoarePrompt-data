The code snippet calculates the difference between `n` and the length of the list `a` and assigns this difference to the variable `cnt`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is an integer within the range [1, 3 · 10^5] and `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, the length of `a` will be some integer value less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `cnt` will be the number of elements that are missing from `a` to make its length equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that stores the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.
