To determine the state before the for loop starts such that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means we need to ensure that `n` is set in a way that allows the loop to execute.

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) where each `a_i` satisfies (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9).

The variable `i` is not something we need to initialize before the loop starts; it is automatically initialized by the `range` function. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Since the problem statement specifies that `n` is already within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment to `n` is necessary based on the loop's execution condition.

However, to adhere strictly to the format and ensure clarity, we can state that `n` must be within the specified range to guarantee the loop executes.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of `n` integers (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) where each `a_i` satisfies (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9)**
