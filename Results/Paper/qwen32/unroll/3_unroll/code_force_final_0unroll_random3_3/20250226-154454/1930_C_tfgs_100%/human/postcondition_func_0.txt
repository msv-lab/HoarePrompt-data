The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It modifies each element `a_i` by adding `i + 1` to it. Then, it constructs a new list `ans` of `n` elements by including all unique modified elements in descending order and filling any remaining slots with additional elements in descending order to reach the length `n`. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
