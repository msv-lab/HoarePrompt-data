The code snippet appends `-1` to the list `nums`. Therefore, the list `nums` will now include `-1` as its last element. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input line with an additional `-1` appended to it, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of `nums`, `arr` is an empty list.**
