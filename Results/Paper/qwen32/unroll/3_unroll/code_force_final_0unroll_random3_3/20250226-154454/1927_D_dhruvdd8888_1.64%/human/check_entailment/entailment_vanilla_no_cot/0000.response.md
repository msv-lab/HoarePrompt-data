Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for finding two different elements within the specified range for each query. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Segmentation**: The program attempts to segment the array into contiguous blocks of identical elements and store them in `arr`. However, this approach is not sufficient to handle all cases. For example, if the query range contains more than one segment but all segments have the same value, the program will incorrectly conclude that no two different elements exist.

2. **Handling of Queries**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment corresponding to the left boundary of the query. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the query range spans multiple segments or when the right boundary of the query is within a segment. The logic for checking these cases is flawed.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire query range consists of the same element. In such cases, the program should output `-1 -1` but may not do so correctly.

4. **Debugging Code**: The program includes debugging code (`if ppp == 23:`) that should be removed for a correct solution.

To fix the program, a more straightforward approach would be to iterate over the range for each query and find the first pair of different elements. This approach would be more reliable and easier to implement correctly given the constraints.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    tc = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, input[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        q = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            found = False
            for i in range(l - 1, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        results.append(f"{i + 1} {j + 1}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over the range for each query and finds the first pair of different elements, ensuring correctness for all cases.
