There are t test cases (1 \le t \le 10^4). For each test case, there is an integer n (2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 \le a_i \le 10^6. There are q queries (1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case, and each query is defined by two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
