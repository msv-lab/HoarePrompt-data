### Reasoning:

The program is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the array, and the goal is to find a pair of indices within that range such that the corresponding elements are different. If no such pair exists, the program should output `-1 -1`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **NameError in the Code**:
   - The line `if (ppp == 23) : print(nums)` will cause a `NameError` because `nums` is not defined in the scope where it is being printed. This line seems to be a debugging statement that was not properly commented out or adjusted for the correct scope.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Handling Queries**:
   - The logic for handling queries seems to have some issues. Specifically, the use of `bisect_left` and the subsequent checks for `s` and `e` do not correctly identify pairs of indices with different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - For example, the condition `if s > l` and the subsequent checks might not correctly identify the first pair of different elements within the range.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not seem to handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same, the program should output `-1 -1`, but the current logic might not handle this correctly.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - The program's approach to finding pairs of different elements within the range `[l, r]` might not be efficient enough given the constraints. The use of `bisect_left` and subsequent checks might not be optimal.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly the `NameError` and the incorrect logic for handling queries, the program is not correct as it stands.

### Correctness:
**False**
