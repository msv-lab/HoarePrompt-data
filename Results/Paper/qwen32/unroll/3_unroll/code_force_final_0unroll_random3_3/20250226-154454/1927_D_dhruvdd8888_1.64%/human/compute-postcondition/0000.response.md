The provided code snippet only involves reading a line of input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not change any of the existing variables or introduce new ones based on the given initial state. Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `input`, which is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`.

Output State: **There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, there is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. There are q queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) for each test case, and each query is defined by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The variable `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`.**
