Output State: **There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, there is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. There are q queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) for each test case, and each query is defined by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The variable `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`. `N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.**

In simple terms, the variable `N` now holds the value of the first integer read from the input, which represents the number of test cases. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
