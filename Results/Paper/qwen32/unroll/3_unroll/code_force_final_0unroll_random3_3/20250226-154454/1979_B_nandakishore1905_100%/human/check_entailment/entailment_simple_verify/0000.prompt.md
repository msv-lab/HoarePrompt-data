You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

        k = abs(n - m)

    #State: For each test case, the output will be an integer based on the conditions: the absolute difference `k` if it's a power of 2, `1` if `k` is odd, or the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` if `k` is neither a power of 2 nor odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the length of the longest common subsegment for all possible cases. The logic in the program seems to be based on some incorrect assumptions about the relationship between the XOR operation and the lengths of common subsegments.

To demonstrate why the program is incorrect, let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
2
0 3
1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**

1. For `x = 0` and `y = 3`:
   - Sequence `a`: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...]`
   - Sequence `b`: `[3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6, 5, 4, ...]`
   - Longest common subsegment: `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]` (length = 2)

2. For `x = 1` and `y = 2`:
   - Sequence `a`: `[1, 3, 2, 0, 5, 7, 6, 4, ...]`
   - Sequence `b`: `[3, 0, 1, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7, ...]`
   - Longest common subsegment: `[1]` or `[3]` (length = 1)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
- For `x = 0` and `y = 3`, the program will output `1` instead of `2`.
- For `x = 1` and `y = 2`, the program will output `1` which is correct in this case but it is not generalizable to all cases.

The logic in the program seems to be based on the assumption that the length of the longest common subsegment is related to the power of 2 in the XOR result, which is not generally true for all values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one test case and does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
