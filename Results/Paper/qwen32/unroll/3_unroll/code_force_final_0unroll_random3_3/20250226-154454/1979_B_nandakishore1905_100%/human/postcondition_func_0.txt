The function processes a number of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the two integers and then determines the output based on specific conditions: if the difference is a power of 2, it outputs the difference; if the difference is odd, it outputs 1; otherwise, it outputs the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the difference.
