Correctness: **False**

The given program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period (m minutes) and sums them up, which does not account for the possibility of overlapping fireworks from both installations.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals `a` and `b`, and then determining how many fireworks from each installation can be visible within a period that includes the LCM.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        A = m // a + 1
        B = m // b + 1
        AB = m // lcm_ab + 1
        max_fireworks = A + B - AB
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
- We calculate the number of fireworks visible from each installation (`A` and `B`).
- We calculate the number of fireworks visible from both installations simultaneously (`AB`).
- The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `A + B - AB` to avoid double-counting the fireworks that are visible from both installations at the same time.
