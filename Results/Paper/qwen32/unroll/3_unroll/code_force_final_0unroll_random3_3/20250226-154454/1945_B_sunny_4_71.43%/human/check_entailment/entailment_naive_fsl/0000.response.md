Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation independently and then sums them up. However, this approach does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Specifically, the program does not consider the cases where fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time, which would reduce the total count of distinct visible fireworks.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6 7 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, ...
- Fireworks are visible for 5 minutes after launch (from x to x + 4).

At time 0, both fireworks are visible, but the program will count them as 2 separate fireworks. At time 7, only the second firework is visible, and at time 6, only the first firework is visible. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.

However, the program will output:
```
3
```
Because it adds the number of fireworks from both installations independently (2 + 1 = 3), without considering the overlap at time 0.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
