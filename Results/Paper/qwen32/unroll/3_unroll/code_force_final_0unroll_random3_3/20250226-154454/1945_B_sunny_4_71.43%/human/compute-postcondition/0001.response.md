The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Since `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. There is no need to adjust `t` further because it already meets the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
