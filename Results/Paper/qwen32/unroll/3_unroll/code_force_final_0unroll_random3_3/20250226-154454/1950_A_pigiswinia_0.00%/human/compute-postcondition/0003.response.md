The function `func` accepts an integer `t` such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The specific return value for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function performs some computation or comparison on `a`, `b`, and `c`.
