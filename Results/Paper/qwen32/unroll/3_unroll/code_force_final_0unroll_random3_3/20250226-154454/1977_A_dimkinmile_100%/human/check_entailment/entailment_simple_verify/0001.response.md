### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness using the provided problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Operations**: Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move.
2. **Parity**: Each move toggles the parity of the number of cubes. Starting from 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, the number of cubes should be even, and after an odd number of moves, it should be odd.
3. **Minimum Moves**: To end up with `m` cubes, Nikita needs at least `m` moves if `m > 0` because he can't remove cubes if there are none.

#### Key Conditions:
1. **Parity Condition**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the parity of the number of cubes changes correctly.
2. **Non-negativity Condition**: `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach `m` cubes. This condition is necessary because you cannot have a negative number of cubes.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to ensure the parity condition is met.
- `n - m >= 0` to ensure the minimum moves condition is met.

If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program correctly checks the conditions and prints "Yes" or "No" based on the evaluation of `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the conditions with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` is `True`
   - `3 - 3 >= 0` is `True`
   - Output: "Yes" (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `(2 - 4) % 2 == 0` is `True`
   - `2 - 4 >= 0` is `False`
   - Output: "No" (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` is `True`
   - `5 - 3 >= 0` is `True`
   - Output: "Yes" (Correct)

The annotations and the example evaluations confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks both the parity condition and the minimum moves condition to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
