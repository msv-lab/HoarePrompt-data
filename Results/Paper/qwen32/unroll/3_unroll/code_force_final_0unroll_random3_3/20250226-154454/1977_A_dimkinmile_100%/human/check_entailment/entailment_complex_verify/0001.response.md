### Reasoning:
Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem description, the provided program, and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the program.

**Problem Recap:**
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- We need to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Parity of Moves:**
   - Starting with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, the number of cubes will be even.
   - Starting with 0 cubes (even), after an odd number of moves, the number of cubes will be odd.
2. **Minimum Moves Required:**
   - To have `m` cubes, `n` must be at least `m` because you can't remove cubes if there are none.
3. **Parity Condition:**
   - The difference `n - m` must be even because adding/removing cubes alternates the parity.

**Program Analysis:**
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise, it prints "No".

- **Parity Condition:** `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the parity of the number of cubes changes correctly.
- **Minimum Moves Condition:** `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach `m` cubes (you can't remove more cubes than there are).

**Verification of Conditions:**
1. **Parity Condition:** The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is correct because it ensures the parity matches the requirement.
2. **Minimum Moves Condition:** The condition `n - m >= 0` is also correct because it ensures there are enough moves to achieve `m` cubes.

**Annotations:**
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. They state that if `n - m` is even and non-negative, the program prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This aligns with the logic described above.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity and minimum moves conditions. The annotations support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
