Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` in the program is not fully accurate. Here's why:

1. **Case 1: n < m**
   - If `n < m`, Nikita can only add cubes. Since `n` moves are not enough to reach `m` cubes, the correct answer should be "No".
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` will be false in this case, so it will correctly print "No".

2. **Case 2: n >= m**
   - If `n >= m`, Nikita can add cubes up to `n` times. The difference `n - m` represents the number of surplus moves after reaching `m` cubes. If `n - m` is even, it means Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` will be true in this case, so it will correctly print "Yes".

However, the condition does not fully cover the scenario where `n` is odd and `m` is 0. In this case, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs, but since `n` is odd, one move will be left, which means the final number of cubes will be 1, not 0. Therefore, the correct answer should be "No".

**Counterexample:**
- Input: `1 0 1`
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `Yes` (because `(1 - 0) % 2 == 0` and `1 - 0 >= 0`)

Thus, the program is incorrect for the case where `n` is odd and `m` is 0.
