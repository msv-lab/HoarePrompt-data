Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. Given `n` moves and a desired height `m` for the tower, we need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

The logic in the provided program is as follows:
- For each test case, the program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Condition `n - m >= 0`**:
   - This means that the number of moves `n` should be at least as large as the desired height `m`. This is because if `n < m`, there aren't enough moves to build a tower of height `m` by only adding cubes (since each move can add or remove only one cube).

2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**:
   - This condition ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired height is even. The reason is that each move changes the height of the tower by exactly one cube. To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of "add" moves must exceed the number of "remove" moves by exactly `m`. If the difference `n - m` is even, it means that the excess moves (after accounting for the `m` necessary "add" moves) can be evenly split between "add" and "remove" moves.

Given these points, the logic in the program is correct. If both conditions are satisfied, it is indeed possible for Nikita to build a tower of height `m` after `n` moves.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
