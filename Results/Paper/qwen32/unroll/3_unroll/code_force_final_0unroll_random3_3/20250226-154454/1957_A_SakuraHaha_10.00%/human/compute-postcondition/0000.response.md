The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This affects the variable `n` but does not change the description of the test cases or their structure. Therefore, after executing this line, `n` will hold the integer value read from the input, and the other parts of the precondition remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of sticks available. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the stick lengths. `n` is an integer read from the input.**
