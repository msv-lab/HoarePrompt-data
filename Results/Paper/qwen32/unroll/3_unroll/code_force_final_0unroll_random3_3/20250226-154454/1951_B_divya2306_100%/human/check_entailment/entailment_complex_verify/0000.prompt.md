You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all a_i values are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: - `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #   - `a` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list.
    #   - `wins` is the number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the player's cow's rating, up to the point where a cow with a higher rating is encountered or all cows are compared.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the player's cow's rating)

    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. `a` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list. `wins` is the number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the player's cow's rating, up to the point where a cow with a higher rating is encountered or all cows are compared. Additionally, `wins` is less than `k`.

    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)) (where `wins` is the count of cows with ratings less than or equal to the player's cow's rating, and `win_with_swap` is the count of cows including the player's cow with ratings less than or equal to the player's cow's rating)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the player's cow, and a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. It calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be beaten or tied by the player's cow, considering the player's cow's position and ratings. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve with an optimal swap or by doing nothing. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Inconsistent Indexing**:
   - The code uses `k - 1` to access the cow's rating, which is correct as Python uses 0-based indexing.
   - However, the logic for calculating wins and considering swaps is inconsistent and does not correctly simulate the tournament rules.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Wins Calculation**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` is intended to count the number of wins without any swap.
   - The condition `if a[i] > a[k - 1]: break` correctly identifies when the cow loses.
   - However, the subsequent logic for calculating `win_with_swap` is flawed:
     - The loop `for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):` is incorrect because it doesn't properly simulate the effect of swapping the cow with another cow.
     - The logic `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` does not correctly account for the number of wins after an optimal swap.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where the cow is already in the best possible position to win the maximum number of matches.
   - The code does not correctly simulate the tournament after a swap, especially when the cow is swapped with a cow that has a higher rating.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1
```

For the second test case:
- Initially, the cow at position 5 (rating 12) is considered.
- Without any swap, the cow wins against the cow with rating 10 and 7, but loses to the cow with rating 727.
- The correct output should be 2, but the code might not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic for calculating `win_with_swap`.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate Wins Without Swap**:
   - Simulate the tournament starting from the cow's initial position.
   - Count the number of matches the cow wins consecutively.

2. **Calculate Wins With Optimal Swap**:
   - Consider swapping the cow with each cow before its initial position.
   - Simulate the tournament for each swap and count the number of matches the cow wins.
   - Keep track of the maximum number of wins achieved through any swap.

3. **Output the Maximum Wins**:
   - Compare the wins from the no-swap scenario with the wins from each swap scenario.
   - Output the maximum number of wins.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for your cow in all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
