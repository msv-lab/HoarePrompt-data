The code reads a list of integers from the input, which represent the Cowdeforces ratings of `n` cows. This list is then assigned to the variable `a`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is the index of the cow owned by the player. The list `a` is assigned the list of Cowdeforces ratings `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` from the input.**
