To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `i`, but the loop's execution also depends on the value provided by `int(input())`, which determines the range.

The loop will execute if the range is greater than 0, meaning `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Given the problem statement, `int(input())` corresponds to the variable `n` from the description of the input, which is the size of the n x n grid for each test case.

Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 2 and 1000 for each test case, the loop will always execute as long as the input is correctly provided according to the problem constraints. However, to match the format and ensure clarity, we should specify that `n` must be within the given range.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of the n x n grid**
