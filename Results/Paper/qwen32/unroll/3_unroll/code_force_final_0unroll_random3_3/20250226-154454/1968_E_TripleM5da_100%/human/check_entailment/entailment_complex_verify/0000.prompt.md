You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of the n x n grid for each test case.

    #State: For each test case with size `n`, the output consists of the lines `1 1`, `1 2`, and `(i, i)` for each `i` from `3` to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` grid. For each test case, it outputs the coordinates `1 1`, `1 2`, and `(i, i)` for each `i` from `3` to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) (the set of distinct Manhattan distances) for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the program and provide a counterexample.

The program outputs the following points for each \(n\):
- For \(n = 2\): (1, 1), (1, 2)
- For \(n = 3\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
- For \(n = 4\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
- For \(n = 5\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
- For \(n = 6\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)

Let's consider the case when \(n = 3\):
- Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
- Distances:
  - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\)

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should be:
- Points: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)
- Distances:
  - Between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
  - Between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
- Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)

As seen, the program does not generate the optimal set of points for \(n = 3\), and it is likely that it fails for other values of \(n\) as well. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
