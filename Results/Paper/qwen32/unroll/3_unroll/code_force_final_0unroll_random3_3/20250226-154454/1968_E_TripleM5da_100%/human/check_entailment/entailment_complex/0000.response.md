Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by outputting specific points for each test case. The strategy is to place points at (1,1), (1,2), and (i,i) for i from 3 to n. However, this strategy does not necessarily maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\).

Let's analyze the given strategy:
- For n=2, the points are (1,1) and (1,2). The Manhattan distance is 1, and the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is {0,1}, which is correct for n=2.
- For n=3, the points are (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3). The Manhattan distances are 0, 1, 2, and 3, giving \(\mathcal{H}\) as {0,1,2,3}, which is correct for n=3.
- For n=4, the points are (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), and (4,4). The Manhattan distances are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, giving \(\mathcal{H}\) as {0,1,2,3,4}, which is correct for n=4.
- For n=5, the points are (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), and (5,5). The Manhattan distances are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving \(\mathcal{H}\) as {0,1,2,3,4,5}, which is correct for n=5.
- For n=6, the points are (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6). The Manhattan distances are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, giving \(\mathcal{H}\) as {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is correct for n=6.

However, the strategy does not guarantee that it will always produce the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all possible values of n. For example, for n=5, the optimal arrangement might be different from the one given in the program, and the program does not handle larger values of n in a way that ensures the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Given the examples in the problem statement, it seems that the program is not always producing the optimal solution for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
