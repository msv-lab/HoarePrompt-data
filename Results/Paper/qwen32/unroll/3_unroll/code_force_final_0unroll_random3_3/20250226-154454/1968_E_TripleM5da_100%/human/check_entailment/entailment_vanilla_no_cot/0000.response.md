Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all given \(n\). The program outputs a fixed pattern of points that does not guarantee the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\).

Let's analyze the pattern the program generates:
- For \(n=2\), it outputs (1,1) and (1,2), which is correct for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) since \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).
- For \(n=3\), it outputs (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3). The set of Manhattan distances here is \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 4\}\), which is not optimal. The optimal solution for \(n=3\) is (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
- For \(n=4\) and higher, the pattern continues to output points that do not maximize the distinct Manhattan distances.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), a different strategy is needed. One such strategy is to place points in a way that maximizes the variety of distances. For example, placing points on a diagonal and at the corners can help achieve this.

Here is a corrected version of the program that attempts to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        points = []
        if n == 2:
            points = [(1, 1), (1, 2)]
        elif n == 3:
            points = [(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)]
        else:
            # Place points in a way to maximize distinct Manhattan distances
            points.append((1, 1))
            points.append((1, 3))
            points.append((n, 3))
            points.append((n, n))
            for i in range(4, n):
                points.append((1, i))
                if len(points) == n:
                    break
            for i in range(4, n):
                points.append((i, 1))
                if len(points) == n:
                    break
        for x, y in points:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

This program places points in a pattern that aims to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. However, creating an optimal strategy for all \(n\) is complex and might require a more sophisticated approach or algorithm. The provided solution is a simple heuristic that works for small values of \(n\), but it does not guarantee the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all \(n\).
