Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) (the set of distinct Manhattan distances) for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the program and provide a counterexample.

The program outputs the following points for each \(n\):
- For \(n = 2\): (1, 1), (1, 2)
- For \(n = 3\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
- For \(n = 4\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
- For \(n = 5\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
- For \(n = 6\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)

Let's consider the case when \(n = 3\):
- Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
- Distances:
  - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\)

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should be:
- Points: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)
- Distances:
  - Between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
  - Between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
- Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)

As seen, the program does not generate the optimal set of points for \(n = 3\), and it is likely that it fails for other values of \(n\) as well. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
