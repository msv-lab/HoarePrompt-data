Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it performs a series of operations to determine if `k` can be reduced to zero by subtracting products of pairs of numbers derived from `n` and `k`. If `k` is reduced to zero, it outputs 'YES', followed by the number of operations performed and the sequence of numbers used in the operations. If `k` cannot be reduced to zero, it outputs 'NO'.**
