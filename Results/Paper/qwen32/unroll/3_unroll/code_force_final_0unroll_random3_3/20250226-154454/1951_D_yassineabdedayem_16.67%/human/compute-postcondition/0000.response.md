The value of `t` is reassigned to the integer value obtained from the input. The conditions on `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `k` <= 10^{18}.**
