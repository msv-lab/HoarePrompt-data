You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it performs a series of operations to determine if `k` can be reduced to zero by subtracting products of pairs of numbers derived from `n` and `k`. If `k` is reduced to zero, it outputs 'YES', followed by the number of operations performed and the sequence of numbers used in the operations. If `k` cannot be reduced to zero, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several logical errors that can lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Here are a few issues that I've identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `Min` and `Max`:** The program calculates `Min` and `Max` using `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively. This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the values of `Min` and `Max` are used correctly to buy the jewels. The intention should be to determine a price that allows Alice to buy a certain number of jewels without exceeding her budget.

2. **Incorrect Update of `k` and `n`:** The program updates `k` and `n` based on `Min` and `Max` in a way that does not guarantee Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, the line `k = k - Max` or `k = k - Min` does not correctly reflect the number of jewels Alice is buying at each stall.

3. **Loop Conditions:** The loop condition `(n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k))` is not sufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The condition `(n >= k)` is particularly problematic because it can prevent the loop from running if `n` is less than `k`, even if Alice can still buy `k` jewels by setting appropriate prices.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is much smaller than `k` or vice versa. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, the program might not be able to set prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

To illustrate one of these issues, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
100 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
5
20 20 20 20 20
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might not produce the expected output because of the incorrect logic for setting prices and updating `k` and `n`.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all possible inputs, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
