The code snippet assigns the string of all uppercase letters of the English alphabet to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is an integer `n` between 1 and 50, inclusive. The variable `s` is newly introduced and set to the value of `string.ascii_uppercase`, which is a constant in the `string` module representing the string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50; `s` is the string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.**
