You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50.

    s = string.ascii_uppercase

                ans, x = 'AAA', 1

                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1

            print(ans)
        
    #State: - After all iterations, the variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
    #   - The variable `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop ends, as it increments from 0 to `t-1`.
    #   - The variables `n`, `ans`, and `x` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop and not the printed output, we focus on the state of the variables:
    #
    #- `t` remains the same.
    #- `s` remains the same.
    #- `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop ends.
    #- `n`, `ans`, and `x` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Thus, the output state can be described as:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each with an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n` is 1. Otherwise, it constructs a string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string. The string is formed by repeating each letter twice, with an extra 'AAA' if `n` is odd. The function does not modify the input values `t` and `n` beyond using them to determine the output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not handle the case when `n == 1` correctly according to the problem description. The problem specifies that there must be exactly `n` special characters in the string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For `n == 1`, there is no way to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters. This is because having a single character in a string inherently means it has no neighbors, and thus cannot be special according to the definition.

The code incorrectly prints "NO" for `n == 1`, which is correct, but it should also provide a correct string for all other valid values of `n`. However, the code does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly in the context of the problem statement's requirements for other values of `n`.

Let's consider the other cases:
- For `n == 2`, the code correctly generates a string like "AA", but this string does not have any special characters. According to the definition, both 'A's are neighbors of each other and thus not special.
- For `n == 6`, the code generates a string like "AAABAACC", which has 6 special characters (at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8), which is correct.

However, the code does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly in the context of the problem statement's requirements for other values of `n`. The code should not print "NO" for `n == 1` because the problem does not specify that "NO" is the only valid output for `n == 1`. Instead, it should be clarified that there is no valid string for `n == 1`.

Thus, the code is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the case `n == 1` and the incorrect generation of strings for other values of `n` that do not meet the special character criteria.

To fix the code, we need to ensure that the generated string for any `n` has exactly `n` special characters. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
import string

def func():
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = 'A'
            x = 1
            for j in range(n - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

This version ensures that for `n > 1`, the string has exactly `n` special characters. For `n == 1`, it correctly prints "NO".
