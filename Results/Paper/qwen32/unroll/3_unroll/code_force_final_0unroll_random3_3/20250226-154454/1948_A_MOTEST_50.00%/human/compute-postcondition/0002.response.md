`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `s` remains unchanged as `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and this precondition still holds after the code execution. The value of `n` for each of the `t` test cases is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and `s` is `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.**
