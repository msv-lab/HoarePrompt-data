The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
