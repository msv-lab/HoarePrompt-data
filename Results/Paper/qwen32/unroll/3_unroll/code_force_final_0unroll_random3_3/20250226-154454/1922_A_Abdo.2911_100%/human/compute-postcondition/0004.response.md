Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (where `n` is specified for each test case). It then checks if there exists at least one position `i` in the strings such that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
