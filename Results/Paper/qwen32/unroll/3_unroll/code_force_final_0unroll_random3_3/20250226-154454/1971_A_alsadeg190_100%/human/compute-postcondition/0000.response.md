The code snippet provided assigns a new value to the variable `x` by reading an integer input from the user. This means the previous value of `x` is overwritten, and `y` and `t` remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9 for each of the `t` test cases. After the code execution, `x` will hold the integer value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= 9.**
