Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price is less than or equal to buying them individually, and when `n` is odd.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if n % 2:
    if 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b + a)
elif 2 * a < b:
    print(a * n)
else:
    print(n // 2 * b)
```

When `n` is odd, the code correctly checks if buying individually is cheaper than the promotion. However, when `n` is even, the code only checks if buying individually is cheaper than the promotion and does not consider the promotion for even `n`. This means that for even `n`, it might not always choose the promotion when it is cheaper.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
4 5 9
```

Expected Output:
```
18
```

Explanation of the expected output: For 4 yogurts, buying two sets of two yogurts at the promotion price (9 burles each set) results in a total cost of 18 burles, which is cheaper than buying them individually (20 burles).

However, the given program will output:
```
20
```

This is because the program does not consider the promotion when `n` is even, and it defaults to buying all yogurts individually if `2 * a < b` is not true.

To fix this, the program should always consider the promotion for even `n` if it is cheaper than buying individually. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (a if n % 2 else 0))

```

This corrected version ensures that the promotion is considered for both odd and even `n` when it is cheaper than buying individually.
