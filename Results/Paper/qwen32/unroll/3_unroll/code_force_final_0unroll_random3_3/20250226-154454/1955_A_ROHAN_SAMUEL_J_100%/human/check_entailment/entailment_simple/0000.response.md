### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts during a promotion. The key logic hinges on whether it's cheaper to purchase yogurts individually or in pairs.

Here’s a breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Loop**: The program reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Odd vs. Even `n`**:
    - If `n` is odd, the program needs to consider the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b` and one additional yogurt at the regular price `a`.
    - If `n` is even, the program only needs to consider the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b`.

3. **Comparison of Costs**:
    - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`), it’s cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
    - Otherwise, it’s cheaper to buy yogurts in pairs (or a pair and one individual yogurt if `n` is odd).

Let's verify this with the provided example:

- **First Test Case**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even, the cost is `n // 2 * b = 2 // 2 * 9 = 9`.
  - This matches the expected output of `9`.

- **Second Test Case**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a = 3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 4 + 5 = 14`.
  - This matches the expected output of `14`.

- **Third Test Case**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a = 3 // 2 * 11 + 5 = 5 + 5 = 15`.
  - This matches the expected output of `15`.

- **Fourth Test Case**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, the cost is `n // 2 * b = 4 // 2 * 11 = 22`.
  - However, since `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, it’s cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, resulting in `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
  - This matches the expected output of `20`.

The program correctly handles all the scenarios described in the problem statement and the example cases provided. Thus, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
