You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it prints the minimum cost to achieve a certain configuration, either by using `a` for each unit or using `b` for pairs, considering whether `n` is odd or even.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price is less than or equal to buying them individually, and when `n` is odd.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if n % 2:
    if 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b + a)
elif 2 * a < b:
    print(a * n)
else:
    print(n // 2 * b)
```

When `n` is odd, the code correctly checks if buying individually is cheaper than the promotion. However, when `n` is even, the code only checks if buying individually is cheaper than the promotion and does not consider the promotion for even `n`. This means that for even `n`, it might not always choose the promotion when it is cheaper.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
4 5 9
```

Expected Output:
```
18
```

Explanation of the expected output: For 4 yogurts, buying two sets of two yogurts at the promotion price (9 burles each set) results in a total cost of 18 burles, which is cheaper than buying them individually (20 burles).

However, the given program will output:
```
20
```

This is because the program does not consider the promotion when `n` is even, and it defaults to buying all yogurts individually if `2 * a < b` is not true.

To fix this, the program should always consider the promotion for even `n` if it is cheaper than buying individually. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (a if n % 2 else 0))

```

This corrected version ensures that the promotion is considered for both odd and even `n` when it is cheaper than buying individually.
