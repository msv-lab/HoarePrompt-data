To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and what it outputs based on the given conditions.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The logic inside the loop determines the output based on the parity of `n` (whether `n` is odd or even) and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.

Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. If `n` is odd:
   - If `2 * a < b`, the output is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the output is `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. If `n` is even:
   - If `2 * a < b`, the output is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the output is `n // 2 * b`.

The loop does not modify `t` or the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` outside of the current iteration. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the last iteration will still be in memory, but they are not part of the output state as they are not retained between iterations.

The output state is solely determined by the printed values for each test case, which are not stored or modified in any variables that persist after the loop.

Given the format requirement, the output state is described as follows:

Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the output consists of `t` lines, each line being the result of the computation for each test case based on the provided logic. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` from the last iteration are not part of the output state.**
