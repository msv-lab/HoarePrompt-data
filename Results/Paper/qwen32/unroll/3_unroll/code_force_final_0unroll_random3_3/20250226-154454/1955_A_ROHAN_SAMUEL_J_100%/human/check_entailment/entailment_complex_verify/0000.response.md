Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering a promotion where two yogurts can be bought for `b` burles instead of `2 * a` burles.

### Program Code Analysis
Here is the provided code with annotations:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

#### Annotations Breakdown
- **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- **Input Parsing**: For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read.
- **Odd `n` Case**: 
  - If `2 * a < b`, then the cost is `a * n` (buying each yogurt individually).
  - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually).
- **Even `n` Case**:
  - If `2 * a < b`, then the cost is `a * n` (buying each yogurt individually).
  - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b` (buying as many pairs as possible).

### Original Assessment Analysis
The original assessment claims that the program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when `n` is even and the promotion price `b` is less than or equal to `2 * a`.

#### Counterexample Provided
The counterexample given is:
```
1
4 5 9
```
- **Expected Output**: `18` (buying two sets of two yogurts at 9 burles each).
- **Actual Output**: `20` (buying all yogurts individually at 5 burles each).

### Verification Using Annotations
Let's verify the behavior of the code with the counterexample:
- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the code checks if `2 * a < b`:
  - `2 * 5 = 10` which is not less than `9`, so it goes to the `else` block.
  - The `else` block computes `n // 2 * b` which is `4 // 2 * 9 = 2 * 9 = 18`.

### Conclusion
The code actually does handle the case where `n` is even and `b` is less than `2 * a` correctly. The original assessment's counterexample does not demonstrate an error in the code, as the code correctly computes the minimum cost for the given input.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True** (The given program is correct based on the provided logic and the counterexample does not show an error in the program's behavior.)
