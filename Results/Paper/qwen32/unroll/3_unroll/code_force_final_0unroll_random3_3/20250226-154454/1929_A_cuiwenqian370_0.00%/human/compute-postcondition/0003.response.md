The code snippet assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `right`. Since `n` is the length of the sorted list `arr`, `right` is now set to the index of the last element in `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `new_arr`, and `left`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`.**
