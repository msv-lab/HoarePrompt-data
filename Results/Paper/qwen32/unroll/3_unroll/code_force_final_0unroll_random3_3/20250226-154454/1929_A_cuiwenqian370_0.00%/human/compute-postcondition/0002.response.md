Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `left` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
