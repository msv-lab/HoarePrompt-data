The code snippet provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `w`. This does not affect the other variables `t`, `n`, or the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `w` is an input integer.**
