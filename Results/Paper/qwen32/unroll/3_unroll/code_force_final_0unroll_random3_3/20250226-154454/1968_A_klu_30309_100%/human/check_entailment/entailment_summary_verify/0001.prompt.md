You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. It returns a list `results` where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for a given \( x \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then reads the next \( t \) integers, each representing a value of \( x \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each \( x \), the program initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
   - For each \( y \), it calculates \( \gcd(x, y) \) and the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and `best_y`.
   - **Critical Issue**: The program breaks out of the loop after the first iteration where `max_sum` is updated. This means it does not continue checking other possible \( y \) values that might yield a higher sum.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the best \( y \) found for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it breaks out of the loop after the first update to `max_sum`, which means it does not explore all possible values of \( y \) to ensure that the maximum possible sum is found. 

### Example:
For \( x = 10 \):
- The program checks \( y = 9 \) first and finds \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \).
- It updates `max_sum` to 10 and `best_y` to 9 and breaks out of the loop.
- However, \( y = 5 \) would yield \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \), which is also a valid and optimal solution, but the program does not find it because it breaks after the first update.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the maximum possible sum is found because it exits the loop too early. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
