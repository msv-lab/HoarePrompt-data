Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it contains a logical error in the inner loop. The `break` statement is used immediately after updating `max_sum` and `best_y`, causing the loop to terminate prematurely after the first iteration. This means the program only checks the largest possible `y` (which is `x-1`) and does not consider other potential values of `y` that might yield a higher sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`.

The `break` statement should be removed to ensure the loop checks all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `1` to find the maximum sum. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
            # Removed the break statement here
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

With this correction, the program will correctly find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case.
