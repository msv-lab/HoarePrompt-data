Let's analyze the given Python code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
- **Objective:** Create a transition video plan for `n` scenarios such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type (funny or scary) are shown, regardless of the order of scenarios.
- **Constraints:** 
  - At most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) videos are already decided.
  - The plan must be symmetric (i.e., the video from `i` to `j` is the same as from `j` to `i`).

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code reads `n` and then `n` lines representing the transition videos.
   - It counts the number of funny (`a[i]`) and scary (`b[i]`) videos for each scenario `i`.

2. **Classification of Scenarios:**
   - Scenarios with only funny videos (`sa`) and only scary videos (`sb`) are identified.
   - The code then attempts to balance the number of `F` and `S` videos by appending undecided scenarios to the `sa` or `sb` list based on which list is longer.

3. **Assigning Videos:**
   - The code then iterates over each scenario and assigns `F` or `S` to each undecided video.
   - The logic for assigning `F` or `S` seems flawed, as it uses a threshold (`n // 4 - 1`) which doesn't align with the problem's requirement to ensure no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

### Key Issues
- **Threshold Misuse:** The code uses `n // 4 - 1` as a threshold for assigning `F` or `S`, which does not guarantee that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will occur.
- **Symmetry Violation:** The code does not ensure that the transition videos remain symmetric after assigning the undecided videos.
- **No Guarantee of Correctness:** The code does not provide a mechanism to ensure that the final plan meets the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for all permutations of scenarios.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the code does not guarantee that the final transition video plan meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
