The provided code snippet is:

```python
sa = []
```

This line of code initializes a new list named `sa` and assigns it to an empty list. This operation does not affect the variables `a`, `b`, or `xx` as they are not mentioned in the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` will contain the count of 'F' relationships for each node (including self-loops); `b` will contain the count of 'S' relationships for each node (including self-loops); `xx` will contain the initial empty string followed by the `n` lines of input; `sa` is an empty list.**
