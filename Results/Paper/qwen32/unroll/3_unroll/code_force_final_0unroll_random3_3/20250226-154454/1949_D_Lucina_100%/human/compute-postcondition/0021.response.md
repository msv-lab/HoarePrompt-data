Postcondition: **`a` will contain the count of 'F' relationships for each node (including self-loops); `b` will contain the count of 'S' relationships for each node (including self-loops); `xx` will contain the initial empty string followed by `n` lines of input. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `xx` will have '?' characters replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `sa` will include additional indices where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero, and `t` will be the length of `sa`. Otherwise, `xx` will be a matrix where each '?' character has been replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions specified in the loop, while `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged.**
