The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `sb`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, and `sa`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` will contain the count of 'F' relationships for each node (including self-loops); `b` will contain the count of 'S' relationships for each node (including self-loops); `xx` will contain the initial empty string followed by the `n` lines of input; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list.**
