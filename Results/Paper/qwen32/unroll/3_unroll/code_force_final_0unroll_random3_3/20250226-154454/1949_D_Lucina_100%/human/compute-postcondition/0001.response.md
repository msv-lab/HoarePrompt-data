The code snippet provided initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The initial state of `n` and the input lines remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24; the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters where each j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.' and the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line for all i and j; at most floor(n/2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
