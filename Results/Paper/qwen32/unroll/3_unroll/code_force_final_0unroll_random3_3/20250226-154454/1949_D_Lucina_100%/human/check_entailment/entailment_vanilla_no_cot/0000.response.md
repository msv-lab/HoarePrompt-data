Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem's requirements. Specifically, the logic for assigning 'F' (funny) or 'S' (scary) to the undecided transitions does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type appear consecutively in any permutation of scenarios. The program's approach of assigning 'F' or 'S' based on the number of scenarios in `sa` or `sb` and then filling the rest with the opposite type does not guarantee the required condition for all possible permutations.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a backtracking algorithm or a graph coloring strategy to ensure that the constraints are met for all permutations of scenarios.
