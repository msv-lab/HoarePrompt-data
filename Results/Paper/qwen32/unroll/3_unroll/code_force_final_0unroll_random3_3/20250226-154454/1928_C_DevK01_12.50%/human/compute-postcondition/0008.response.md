The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `q`, which is a list of tuples, and `x`, which is an integer. Each tuple in `q` contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. The function returns a list `M` containing integers that satisfy certain conditions based on the corrected loop logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `q` of tuples and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` containing integers that meet specific conditions determined by the corrected logic within the function.**
