### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by determining all possible values of `k` that fit the constraints for Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing and Iteration:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the position `n` and the number `x` that Vasya received.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the program immediately prints `0` because there can't be a valid `k` in such a case (as per the problem constraints).

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to find potential `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` again to find more potential `k` values.
   - The results from both calls are combined into a list `L1`, which is then converted to a set to remove duplicates.
   - The length of this set is printed, representing the number of distinct valid `k` values.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes two parameters: `q` and `x`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds this integer to the list `M`.
   - It iterates from `1` to the integer part of the square root of `q`. For each integer `i`:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1`, it adds `i` to `M`.
     - If `q // i` is a divisor of `q` and `q // i >= x - 1`, it adds `q // i` to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M` of potential `k` values.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Divisor Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies all possible divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - This is crucial because `k` must be such that `x` can be a valid position in the sequence, which is determined by the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where `y` is odd by immediately returning `0`.
  - It also correctly adjusts for the condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` to include additional potential `k` values.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The algorithm efficiently finds divisors by iterating up to the square root of `q`, which is optimal for large values of `n` and `x` given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find all possible values of `k` that satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
