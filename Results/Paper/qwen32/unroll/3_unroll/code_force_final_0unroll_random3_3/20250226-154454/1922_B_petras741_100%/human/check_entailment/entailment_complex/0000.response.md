Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the number of ways to choose three sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the logic in the program is incorrect as it only considers the case where the three sticks have the same length (i.e., the same exponent). This is not sufficient to form a non-degenerate triangle, which requires that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

The program does not implement the triangle inequality check, which is crucial for determining if three sides can form a non-degenerate triangle. Instead, it only calculates combinations of sticks with the same length, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the lengths of the sticks.
2. Iterate through all possible combinations of three sticks.
3. Check if the three sticks satisfy the triangle inequality.
4. Count and print the number of valid combinations.

Given the current implementation, the program will not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
