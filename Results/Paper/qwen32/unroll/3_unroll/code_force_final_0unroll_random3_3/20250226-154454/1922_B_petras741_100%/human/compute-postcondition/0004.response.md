Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of sticks and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the exponents for the lengths of the sticks, where the length of the i-th stick is 2^{a_i}. The function returns a value or values based on the input, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information.**
