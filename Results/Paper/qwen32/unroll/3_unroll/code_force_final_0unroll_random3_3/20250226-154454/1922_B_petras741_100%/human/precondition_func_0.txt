The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents for the lengths of the sticks, where the length of the i-th stick is 2^{a_i}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
