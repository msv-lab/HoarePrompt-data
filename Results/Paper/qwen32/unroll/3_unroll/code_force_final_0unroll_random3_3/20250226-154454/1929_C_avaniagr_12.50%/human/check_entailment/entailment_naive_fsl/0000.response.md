Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino. There are several issues with the logic in the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Coins Required:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins required (`z`) to guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins by iterating through a loop and updating `z` based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. This logic does not correctly account for the conditions given in the problem description.
   - Specifically, the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately simulate the process of betting and winning/losing as described in the problem.

2. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - The program checks for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` separately, but the logic within these conditions is not correctly derived from the problem description.
   - For `x < k - 1`, the program only checks if `a >= x + 1`. This is not sufficient to guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins.
   - For `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 3`, which is also not a correct condition based on the problem's requirements.

3. **General Strategy:**
   - The problem requires a more sophisticated strategy to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins. The key is to ensure that Sasha can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.
   - The program does not correctly simulate this strategy and instead relies on incorrect conditions and calculations.

To correctly solve the problem, a more accurate approach would be to simulate Sasha's betting strategy and ensure that he can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses while maintaining enough coins to continue betting. The current program does not handle this correctly, and thus it is incorrect.

Here is a potential counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Counterexample:**
- With `k = 3`, `x = 2`, and `a = 4`, Sasha can achieve any number of coins. For example, he can place bets as follows:
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 4 + 2 = 6 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 6 + 2 = 8 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and lose: 8 - 1 = 7 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 7 + 2 = 9 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 9 + 2 = 11 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and lose: 11 - 1 = 10 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and lose: 10 - 1 = 9 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 9 + 2 = 11 coins.
- Sasha can continue this strategy to achieve any number of coins, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this input.
