The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates and prints either `-1` or a non-negative integer `k` based on the conditions provided. The value of `k` is calculated as `a` plus the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3, with an additional increment if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3. The input values `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the function processes each test case independently.
