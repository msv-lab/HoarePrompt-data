The code snippet `testcases = func_3()` assigns the value returned by the function `func_3()` to the variable `testcases`. The initial state specifies that `testcases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it satisfies the condition 1 <= testcases <= 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `testcases` will be whatever integer value `func_3()` returns, but it must still satisfy the condition 1 <= testcases <= 10^4.

Output State: **`testcases` is the integer value returned by `func_3()`, and it satisfies 1 <= `testcases` <= 10^4.**
