The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 · 10^5. This is followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the complexities of the prepared problems, sorted in strictly increasing order (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 · 10^9). Then, m integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_m are given, representing the complexities of the models (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9). Finally, k integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_k are provided, representing the complexities of the functions (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m and k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
