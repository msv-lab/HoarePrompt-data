The function calculates and prints the maximum of two values: the largest difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list `A`, and a computed minimum difference based on elements from lists `D` and `F`. The computed minimum difference is determined by finding the optimal element in `D` for each element in `F` to minimize the maximum of two specific differences.
