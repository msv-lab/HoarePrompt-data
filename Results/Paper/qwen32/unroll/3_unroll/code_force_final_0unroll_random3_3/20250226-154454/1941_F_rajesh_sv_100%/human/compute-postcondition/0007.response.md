The provided code snippet assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` to the variables `left` and `right`, respectively. This means that `left` will hold the element in `A` just before the index where the largest difference `max_diff` occurs, and `right` will hold the element at that index.

The initial state specifies that `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `A`, `D`, and `F` have certain states, but only `left` and `right` are modified by the given code snippet. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `max_diff` will hold the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` will hold the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` will hold the index `i` where the largest difference `max_diff` occurs, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged.**
