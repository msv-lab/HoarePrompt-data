You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code contains a few issues that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases. One of the main problems is in the logic used to find the minimum imbalance after potentially adding a new problem.

Here are a few specific issues:

1. **Initialization of `d` dictionary**: The dictionary `d` used for memoization in `func_1` and `wrapper` is not properly initialized. The `d` dictionary is a local variable and will be reinitialized every time `func_1` is called, which means memoization will not work as intended. However, this function is not actually used anywhere in the provided code, so it might be a leftover from a previous version.

2. **Handling of the largest and second largest differences**: The code correctly identifies the largest and second largest differences in the initial list of complexities. However, the logic to find the optimal position to insert a new problem is flawed.

3. **Binary search logic**: The binary search logic used to find the optimal position to insert a new problem is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the logic for calculating `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` and the conditions to update `l` and `h` might not always yield the correct result.

4. **Edge cases**: The code does not handle certain edge cases properly. For example, if the new problem complexity is such that it can reduce the largest difference but not the second largest difference, the code might not correctly update the answer.

Here is an example case where the code might fail:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 2
1 5 10 20
2 8
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
The largest difference in the initial list is `20 - 10 = 10`. The second largest difference is `10 - 5 = 5`. By adding a problem with complexity `2 + 1 = 3`, the new list becomes `[1, 3, 5, 10, 20]` with the largest difference `10 - 5 = 5`. By adding a problem with complexity `2 + 3 = 5`, the new list becomes `[1, 5, 10, 20]` with the largest difference still `10 - 5 = 5`. By adding a problem with complexity `8 + 1 = 9`, the new list becomes `[1, 5, 9, 10, 20]` with the largest difference `10 - 9 = 1`. By adding a problem with complexity `8 + 3 = 11`, the new list becomes `[1, 5, 10, 11, 20]` with the largest difference `11 - 10 = 1`. The minimum imbalance that can be achieved is `1`.

However, the provided code might not correctly handle this scenario and could output a larger value.

Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
