To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

Bob sells buns with two pricing strategies:
1. **Promotional Pricing:** The first `k` buns are sold at a price that decreases by 1 coin for each subsequent bun, starting from `b` coins for the first bun.
2. **Regular Pricing:** The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price of `a` coins each.

The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can achieve by choosing an optimal value of `k`.

### Logic of the Program:

The given program handles three cases:

1. **Case 1:** If `b <= a`
   - Selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit since the promotional price is not beneficial.
   - **Calculation:** `n * a`

2. **Case 2:** If `b - a >= n`
   - In this scenario, the promotional price can be applied to all `n` buns, and the price for the last bun won't drop below `a` (since `b - (n-1) >= a`).
   - **Calculation:** Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1` which is `n/2 * (2b - n + 1)`

3. **Case 3:** If `b > a` and `b - a < n`
   - Here, the promotional price can only be applied to a subset of buns, specifically up to `b - a` buns (since after that, the price would drop below `a`).
   - **Calculation:** Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a+1` (which is `(b-a)*(b-a+1)/2`) plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b-a)` buns at `a` coins each (`a * (n - (b-a))`).

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`
   - `b > a` and `b - a < n` → Case 3
   - Promotional price applies to 1 bun (`b - a = 1`), so the profit is `5 + 4*3 = 17`

2. **Test Case 2:** `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `b > a` and `b - a >= n` → Case 2
   - Promotional price applies to all 5 buns, so the profit is `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`

3. **Test Case 3:** `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`
   - `b <= a` → Case 1
   - All buns sold at `a`, so the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`

4. **Test Case 4:** `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1`
   - `b <= a` → Case 1
   - All buns sold at `a`, so the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`

5. **Test Case 5:** `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
   - `b <= a` → Case 1
   - All buns sold at `a`, so the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`

6. **Test Case 6:** `n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000`
   - `b > a` and `b - a >= n` → Case 2
   - Promotional price applies to all 1000 buns, so the profit is `1000 + 999 + ... + 1 = 500500`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all possible cases and computes the maximum profit correctly based on the given input constraints and examples.

**Correctness: True**
