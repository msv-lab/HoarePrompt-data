To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`, which represents the number of test cases to process. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are part of the loop body and are not directly relevant to whether the loop will execute or not. They will be initialized within each iteration of the loop.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
