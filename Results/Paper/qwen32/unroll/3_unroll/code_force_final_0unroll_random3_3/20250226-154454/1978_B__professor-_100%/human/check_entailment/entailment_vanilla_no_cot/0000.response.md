Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum profit for all test cases. The logic for determining the maximum profit is flawed, particularly in the third case where `b - a < n`. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Case `b <= a`:** This is correct. If the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price.

2. **Case `b - a >= n`:** This is also correct. If the difference between the modified price of the first bun and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price, starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent bun.

3. **Case `b - a < n`:** This is incorrect. The current logic does not correctly compute the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price. The program adds the sum of the first `(b - a)` buns at the modified price to the sum of the remaining buns at the usual price, which is not optimal.

To compute the maximum profit correctly, Bob should sell as many buns as possible at the modified price until the modified price drops below the usual price. This means selling `k` buns where `k` is the largest integer such that `b - k + 1 >= a`. The profit can be computed as follows:

- Calculate `k` as `min(n, b - a + 1)`.
- Compute the sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price: `sum = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2`.
- Compute the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price: `profit = sum + a * (n - k)`.

Here's the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b - a + 1)
            profit = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
            print(profit)

func()
```

This program correctly computes the maximum profit for all test cases.
