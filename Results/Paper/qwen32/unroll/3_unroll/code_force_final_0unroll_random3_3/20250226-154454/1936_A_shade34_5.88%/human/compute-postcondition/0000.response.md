The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `t` is not directly adjustable in the loop head, but we can ensure that the input provided to the function `func()` will result in `t` being at least 1.

State: **The function `func()` receives input such that `t` (the number of test cases) is at least 1.**
