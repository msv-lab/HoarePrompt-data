The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used to iterate over the range of the integer input `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means the loop will definitely execute at least once without any further adjustments to `t`. However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we don't need to make any changes to the provided state of `t`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
