You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to pair each '<' with a '>' in two strings of equal length, where the pairs are either non-overlapping within the same string or one character is in the first string and the paired character is in the second string. It outputs "YES" if such pairing is possible and "NO" otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid of arrows. Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Initial Check for `b[-2] != '>'`**:
   - The code checks if the second last character of the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `>`. If it is not, it immediately prints "NO". This is incorrect because the robot can still reach (2, n) even if `b[-2]` is not `>`. For example, if the robot can move from (1, n-1) to (2, n-1) and then to (2, n), the condition `b[-2] != '>'` should not be the sole deciding factor.

2. **Handling `n == 1`**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by printing "YES". However, this case is trivial and should be handled correctly, which it does.

3. **Checking Alternating Columns**:
   - The code then checks if all arrows in even-indexed columns of the second row (`b[k]`) are `>`. If not, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the movement in the first row and the possibility of moving down from the first row to the second row.
   - After that, it checks if all arrows in odd-indexed columns of the first row (`a[k]`) are `>`. If not, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This logic is also flawed for the same reason.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - The code finally prints "YES" if `no_path` remains `True` after the above checks, otherwise it prints "NO". This logic is incorrect because the conditions used to set `no_path` are not comprehensive enough to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```
- For this input, the robot can start at (1, 1), move right to (1, 2), move down to (2, 2), move right to (2, 3), move down to (1, 3), move right to (1, 4), and finally move down to (2, 4). Therefore, the correct output should be "YES".
- However, the provided code will print "NO" because it will set `no_path` to `True` during the first loop (since `b[0]` is not `>`) and then set it to `False` during the second loop (since `a[1]` is not `>`).

Thus, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
