Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description. Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Handling of Single Column Case**: The program incorrectly checks `elif n == 1:`. Since the problem specifies that `n` is always even and at least 2, this case will never occur and can be removed.

2. **Logic for Path Determination**:
   - The program checks if `b[-2] != '>'` and prints 'NO' if true. This is incorrect because the robot can still reach (2, n) even if the second last arrow in the second row points left. The robot can move from (1, n-1) to (2, n-1) and then follow the arrow in (2, n-1) to (2, n).
   - The program then checks if all the even-indexed cells in the second row point right. This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target.
   - The program then checks if all the odd-indexed cells in the first row point right. This is also not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target.
   - The program does not correctly simulate the robot's movements and arrow following to determine if the target cell (2, n) can be reached.

3. **Printing k in Loop**: The program prints the value of `k` inside the loop, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect output formatting.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the robot's movements and arrow following for each test case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Start at (1, 1)
        row, col = 1, 1
        
        while True:
            if row == 2 and col == n:
                print('YES')
                break
            
            if row == 1:
                if col < n:
                    if a[col - 1] == '>':
                        col += 1
                    else:
                        col -= 1
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                if col < n:
                    if b[col - 1] == '>':
                        col += 1
                    else:
                        col -= 1
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            
            if row == 1:
                if b[col - 1] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    col -= 1
                row = 2
            else:
                if a[col - 1] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    col -= 1
                row = 1
            
            if col < 1 or col > n:
                print('NO')
                break

func()
```

This corrected program simulates the robot's movements and arrow following for each test case and correctly determines if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
