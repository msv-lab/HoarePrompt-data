The code snippet initializes a deque named `leaves`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`). The only change is the creation of the `leaves` deque, which is initially empty.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where the default value for each key is an empty list; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is 5; `t` is 3; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is an empty deque.**
