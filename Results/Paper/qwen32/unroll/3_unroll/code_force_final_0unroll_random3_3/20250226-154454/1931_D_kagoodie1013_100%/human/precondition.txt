test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The integers n, x, and y satisfy 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in the list. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
