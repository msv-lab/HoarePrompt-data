You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (num % x, num % y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1

    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. It calculates a count for each test case based on specific residue conditions and returns a list of these counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input in a single read operation and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues.
   - It iterates through each number in the array `arr`:
     - For each number `num`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
       - `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. This is equivalent to finding the residue of `-num` modulo `x`. The use of `-num % x` ensures that the residue is adjusted to be non-negative.
       - `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
     - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of that pair to the `count` variable.
     - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic used in the program is sound and correctly identifies beautiful pairs based on the problem description. The use of residues ensures that the conditions `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` are met. The program efficiently handles the constraints provided, and there are no obvious edge cases that it fails to address.

Since the program correctly handles the given examples and there are no apparent issues with the logic, we can conclude that the program is correct.

If you have any specific concerns or edge cases you would like me to consider, please let me know!
