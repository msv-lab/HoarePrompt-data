You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (num % x, num % y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. It calculates a count for each test case based on specific residue conditions and returns a list of these counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) such that:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

### Key Observations:
- For two numbers \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) to satisfy the first condition, \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\). This implies that \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- For the second condition, \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\). This implies that \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

### Approach in the Program:
The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the elements in the array modulo \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, for each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
- `r_x = -num % x`: This is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
- `r_y = num % y`: This is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

The key idea is to count how many times the pair of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) has appeared before in the array. This is done using the `residue_map` dictionary. If a pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has appeared `k` times before, it means there are `k` elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element.

### Implementation Details:
- The program iterates through each element of the array and updates the count of beautiful pairs based on the previously seen residues.
- It then updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the given example:
- For the first test case: `n=6`, `x=5`, `y=2`, `a=[1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
  - The pairs \((1, 5)\) and \((4, 6)\) are beautiful as per the problem statement.
  - The program correctly identifies these pairs and returns `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It efficiently uses a dictionary to keep track of residues and counts the pairs in linear time for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
