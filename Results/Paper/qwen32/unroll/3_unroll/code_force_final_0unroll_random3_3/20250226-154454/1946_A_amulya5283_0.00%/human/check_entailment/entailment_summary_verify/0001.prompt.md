You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to determine the number of operations needed to ensure that the smallest element in the second half of the sorted array is greater than the median. It returns a list of these operation counts corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The median is defined as the middle element in a sorted array. For an even number of elements, it's the element at the \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\) position.

### Solution Analysis
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the array is sorted.
3. **Finding the Median**: The median is identified as the element at the \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\) position in the sorted array.
4. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to track the elements starting from the median position and onward.
5. **Incrementing Elements**: The program repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The number of such operations is counted as the result.

### Correctness Analysis
The key part of the solution that needs verification is the logic for incrementing elements to increase the median. The program uses a heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest element that is part of the median determination.

- **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with elements starting from the median position. This ensures that only the relevant elements (those that could affect the median) are considered.
- **Incrementing Elements**: By repeatedly incrementing the smallest element in this heap, the program ensures that the median is increased in the minimum number of operations. This is because the smallest element is the one that can be increased with the least impact on the number of operations.

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find and increment the elements that affect the median. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
