To ensure that the provided for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because the loop iterates from 0 to `t-1`.

Given:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`.
- `results` is an empty list.

The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts as it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is a positive integer. Since `t` is already described as a positive integer, no further adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `results` is an empty list**
