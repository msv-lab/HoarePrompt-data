The code calculates the value of `not_mid` based on the existing values of `right`, `left`, and `mid`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`. Therefore, `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`.

Substituting the value of `mid` into the equation for `not_mid`, we get:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\right) \]
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \frac{2(\text{right} - \text{left}) + 2 - (\text{right} - \text{left})}{2} \]
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 2}{2} \]

The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged. The value of `mid` remains as `(right - left) // 2`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, and `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`.**
