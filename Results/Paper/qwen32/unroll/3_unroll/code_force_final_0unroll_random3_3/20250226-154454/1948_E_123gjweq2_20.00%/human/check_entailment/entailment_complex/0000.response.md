### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the problem's requirements.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, k)` to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.
   - It iterates over each clique and calls `make_array` to fill the corresponding segment of `arr` and `cliquess` with appropriate values.
   - It prints the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values of `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:**
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on `left` and `right`.
   - It calculates `mid` and `not_mid` to split the segment `[left, right]` into two parts.
   - It fills the first half of the segment with increasing values starting from `small_element`.
   - It fills the second half of the segment with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.
   - It assigns the `clique` identifier to the entire segment.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Assignment of Values:**
  - The function `make_array` fills `arr` with values in a specific pattern, but it does not ensure that each value from 1 to `n` is used exactly once.
  - This is crucial because the problem statement requires that all `a_i` should be distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

- **Incorrect Handling of `cliquess`:**
  - The function `make_array` correctly assigns the `clique` identifier to the elements in the specified segment.
  - However, the program prints `cliquess` as all zeros, which is incorrect as `cliquess` should reflect the clique assignments made by `make_array`.

- **Incorrect Graph Construction:**
  - The program does not construct the graph based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
  - Instead, it assigns values to `arr` in a specific pattern and prints them, but it does not validate if the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly generate the required output for the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the values in `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and it does not validate the graph construction or the clique partitioning.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
