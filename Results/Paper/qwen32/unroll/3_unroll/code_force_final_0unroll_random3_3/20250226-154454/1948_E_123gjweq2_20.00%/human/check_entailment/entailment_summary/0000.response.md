### Reasoning:

The problem requires creating a graph with vertices numbered from 1 to n, assigning distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex, and then adding edges between vertices based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \). The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques, where a clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Let's analyze the provided functions to determine if they meet the problem's requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
    - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, of size `n`.
    - It then calls `make_array` for each clique to fill the arrays accordingly.
    - Finally, it prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
    - This function fills a portion of the `arr` array from index `left` to `right` with a specific pattern.
    - It assigns values to the first half of the range in increasing order and to the second half in decreasing order.
    - It also assigns the same clique number to all elements in the specified range.

### Analysis:

- **Assigning Distinct Integers**:
    - The function `make_array` assigns distinct integers to each vertex within each clique, ensuring that the integers are distinct across the entire graph since each clique is filled with unique values.

- **Creating Edges Based on the Condition**:
    - The values assigned to the vertices by `make_array` are not guaranteed to satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for all pairs of vertices within a clique.
    - The function does not ensure that all pairs of vertices within a clique are connected based on the given condition. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the function might assign values like `[1, 2, 5, 4, 3]` to vertices 1 to 5, but the condition might not hold for all pairs within this assignment.

- **Partitioning into Minimum Number of Cliques**:
    - The function attempts to partition the graph into `ceil(n / k)` cliques, but it does not guarantee that this is the minimum number of cliques required.
    - The partitioning strategy used by `make_array` does not necessarily result in the minimum number of cliques that satisfy the edge condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. They do not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques where every pair of vertices in a clique are connected based on the given condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
