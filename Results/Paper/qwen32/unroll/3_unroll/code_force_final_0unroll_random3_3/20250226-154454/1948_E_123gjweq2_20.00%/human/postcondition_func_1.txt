The function `make_array` modifies a portion of the array `arr` from index `left` to `right` (inclusive) by setting the first half to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. It also assigns the specified `clique` identifier to all elements in the modified portion of `arr`.
