Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made into an array of all identical elements by repeatedly applying a specific operation. If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, we should return -1.

### Key Observations:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if, for any element `a_i` where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`, if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`, we can replace `a_i` with `a_{i-1}`. This means that the array can be transformed into a uniform array if it has a certain pattern.
2. **Non-Beautiful Condition**: An array stops being beautiful if we cannot transform it into a uniform array by removing elements and applying the given operation.

### Strategy:
- If all elements in the array are the same, it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is -1.
- Otherwise, we need to find the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements that, if removed, would break the ability to transform the array into a uniform array through the given operation. This segment will be the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
2. **Check for Uniform Array**: It checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If the length of the set is 1, it prints -1.
3. **Finding Minimum Segment to Remove**:
    - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array.
    - It initializes `cnt` to count the length of the current segment of identical elements.
    - It iterates through the array, updating `cnt` for segments of identical elements.
    - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` (the minimum segment length) and resets `cnt`.
    - Finally, it updates `ans` one last time after the loop to account for the last segment.
    - It prints `ans` as the result.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program is correct. It correctly identifies the minimum segment of identical elements that needs to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. The only case it handles correctly is when the array is already uniform, in which case it returns -1.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
