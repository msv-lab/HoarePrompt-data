Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The current logic fails to account for the requirement that the array should not be able to be made uniform through the allowed operations after the removal of elements.

The logic in the program only counts the longest sequence of identical elements and then attempts to remove that sequence minus one element to make the array not beautiful. However, this approach does not consider all possible ways to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
6
1 2 3 3 2 1
```
The expected output is `2` because you can remove the elements at indices 2 and 5 (0-based indexing) to get the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the provided program will output `1` because it will consider the longest sequence of identical elements (which is `3 3` of length 2) and attempt to remove one element from it, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Another test case:
```
1
7
1 2 3 2 3 2 1
```
The expected output is `3` because you can remove the elements at indices 1, 3, and 5 to get the array `[1, 3, 3, 1]`, which is not beautiful. The provided program will output `1` for this case as well, which is incorrect.

The program needs a more comprehensive approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations.
