### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of any contiguous subarray that contains only the first element of the array `a`. However, this approach is not correct for the problem at hand. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array stops being beautiful, not just finding the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the first element.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The program calculates the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the first element and uses that to determine the number of elements to remove. This does not guarantee that removing these elements will make the array non-beautiful. The problem requires ensuring that after removal, no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same.

2. **Handling of Multiple Elements**: The program does not account for arrays with multiple distinct elements. It only considers the first element and does not handle cases where other elements might form a pattern that can be reduced to a single element through the allowed operations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle cases where the array has a pattern that can be reduced to a single element but where removing a different set of elements would be more optimal. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program might incorrectly determine that removing the first three elements is optimal, but it might not consider removing the middle element `5` and the surrounding `3`s.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
