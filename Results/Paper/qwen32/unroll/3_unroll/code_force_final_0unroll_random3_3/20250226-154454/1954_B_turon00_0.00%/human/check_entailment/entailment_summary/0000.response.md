### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. However, the logic in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Identical Elements Check:** If all elements in the array are the same, the program correctly outputs `-1` because removing any number of elements from such an array would still leave an array that is beautiful.

3. **Minimum Removal Calculation:** The program's approach for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It tries to find the minimum length of any contiguous subarray that contains only the first element of the array. However, this does not necessarily give the correct answer for making the array non-beautiful. The program needs to consider the possibility of removing elements to disrupt the "beautiful" condition, which involves removing elements in such a way that no longer can any element be replaced by its neighbors due to the condition `a[i - 1] = a[i + 1]`.

4. **Logic Flaw:** The core logic of the program (`cnt` and `ans` calculations) is not aligned with the problem's requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program does not account for the structure of the array that allows it to remain beautiful, which involves a more complex analysis of the array's elements and their positions.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
