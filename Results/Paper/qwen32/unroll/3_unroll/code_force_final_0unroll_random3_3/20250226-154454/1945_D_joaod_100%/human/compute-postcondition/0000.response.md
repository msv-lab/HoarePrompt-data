The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
