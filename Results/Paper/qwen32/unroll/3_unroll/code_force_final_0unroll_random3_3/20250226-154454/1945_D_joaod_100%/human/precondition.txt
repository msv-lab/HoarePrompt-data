Each test case consists of integers n and m where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. The test case also includes two lists of integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, where each a_i and b_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
