You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully examine whether it fulfills the requirements of the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the problem and the provided solution.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Objective**: Minimize the number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.
- **Constraints**:
  - Kirill starts at the end of the queue.
  - He can swap with any person `j < i` at a cost of `a_j` coins.
  - For each person `k` between `j` and `i`, he must pay `b_k` coins.
- **Input**:
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`: Number of people in the queue excluding Kirill.
    - `m`: Maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
    - `a`: List of costs to swap with each person.
    - `b`: List of costs to pass through each person.
- **Output**:
  - Minimum number of coins for each test case.

### Program Analysis
The provided program aims to solve the problem by iterating from the end of the queue towards the front, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach a position `m` or less. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cases`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `na_frente`: Number of people in the queue excluding Kirill.
     - `pos_final`: Maximum allowable final position of Kirill (adjusted to 0-based index).
     - `custo_pra_trocar_a`: List of costs to swap with each person.
     - `custo_pra_passar_b`: List of costs to pass through each person.
     - `na_frente` and `pos_final` are adjusted to 0-based indexing.
     - `total`: Accumulated cost.
     - `best`: Variable to store the minimum cost found.

2. **Iterating through the queue**:
   - Iterate from the end of the queue to the beginning.
   - If the current position `v` is within the allowable final position:
     - Update `best` if the current total cost plus the swap cost is less than the current best.
     - Add the minimum of swap cost (`a[v]`) and pass cost (`b[v]`) to `total`.
   - If the current position `v` is not within the allowable final position:
     - Add the minimum of swap cost (`a[v]`) and pass cost (`b[v]`) to `total`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the minimum cost found for each test case.

### Potential Issues
- **Logic Error**: The program does not correctly account for the cost of passing through people when swapping. Specifically, the cost `b[k]` for each `k` between `j` and `i` is not correctly accumulated when Kirill swaps with a person at position `j`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program might not handle edge cases such as when `m = 1` or when all swap costs are higher than pass costs.

### Example Case
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
Expected Output: `14`

The program will incorrectly calculate the cost because it does not correctly account for the cost of passing through people when swapping.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation of Incorrectness
The program fails to correctly account for the cost of passing through people when swapping positions. This results in incorrect calculations for the minimum cost, leading to potential errors in the output for various test cases.
