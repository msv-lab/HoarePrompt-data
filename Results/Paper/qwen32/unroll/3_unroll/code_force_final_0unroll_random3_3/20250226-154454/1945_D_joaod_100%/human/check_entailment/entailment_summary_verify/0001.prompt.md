You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` ≤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to reach a specific position, considering the costs in lists `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Minimize the number of coins Kirill has to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Kirill can bribe people to swap positions.
   - Swapping with a person at position `j` costs `a_j` coins.
   - Passing through a person at position `k` (where `j < k < i`) costs `b_k` coins.
   - Kirill can perform swaps any number of times.
3. **Input**:
   - Number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill).
     - `m`: Maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
     - `a`: List of costs to swap with each person.
     - `b`: List of costs to pass through each person.
4. **Output**:
   - Minimum number of coins for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - It reads `n` and `m`, adjusts them to be zero-indexed, and reads the lists `a` and `b`.
2. **Logic to Calculate Minimum Coins**:
   - The program initializes `total` to 0, representing the accumulated cost.
   - It initializes `best` to a very large number, representing the best (minimum) cost found so far.
   - It iterates from the last person in the queue to the first.
   - If the current position `v` is within the allowed final positions (`v <= pos_final`), it checks if the current `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is better than the `best` cost found so far. If so, it updates `best`.
   - It then adds the cost of either swapping with the person at position `v` or passing through them, depending on which is cheaper.
   - If the current position `v` is not within the allowed final positions, it still adds the cost of either swapping or passing through, but does not update `best` since Kirill can't end up at this position.
3. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, it prints the `best` cost found.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly adds the cost of passing through (`b`) to the `total` regardless of whether Kirill actually passes through that person.
   - Specifically, when Kirill swaps with a person at position `j`, he should only pay the `b_k` costs for people `k` such that `j < k < i`, not for all people up to the current position `v`.
   - This results in overestimating the cost in many cases.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
