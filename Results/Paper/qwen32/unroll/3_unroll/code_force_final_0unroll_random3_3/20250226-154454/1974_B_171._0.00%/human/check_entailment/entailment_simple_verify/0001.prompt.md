You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly decodes the encoded string based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The encoding process involves creating a sorted string `r` of unique characters from the original string `s`.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - The decoding process should reverse this: given the encoded string `b`, we need to reconstruct the original string `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls `func_1(encoded)` to perform the decoding.
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to map each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original character in `s`.

3. **Inspecting `func_1` Function:**
   - The function initializes an empty `mapping` dictionary and an empty `decoded` list.
   - For each character in the encoded string `b`:
     - If the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary, it appends the corresponding value (original character) to the `decoded` list.
     - If the character is not in the `mapping` dictionary, it iterates over all lowercase letters to find one that is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. It then maps the current character in `b` to this new letter and appends the new letter to the `decoded` list.
   - Finally, it joins the `decoded` list into a string and returns it.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The decoding process relies on the assumption that each character in `b` maps uniquely to a character in `s` based on the symmetric property of `r`.
   - However, the `func_1` function does not correctly implement this symmetric mapping. It simply assigns new characters from 'a' to 'z' to each character in `b` without considering the symmetry of `r`.
   - This means that the function does not correctly map characters back to their original positions based on the sorted string `r` and its symmetric counterpart.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s` as per the problem description. It incorrectly assigns new characters without considering the symmetric property of the string `r`.
