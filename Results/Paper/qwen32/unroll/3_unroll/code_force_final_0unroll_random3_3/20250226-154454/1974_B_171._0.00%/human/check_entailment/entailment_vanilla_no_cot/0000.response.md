Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Mapping Construction**: The program attempts to construct a mapping by assigning the first available character from 'a' to 'z' to each new character in the encoded string. This does not respect the symmetry requirement based on the distinct sorted characters of the original string `s`.

2. **Symmetric Character Replacement**: The correct decoding process involves:
   - Identifying the distinct characters in the encoded string and sorting them.
   - Mapping each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted distinct characters list.
   - The first character in the sorted distinct characters list should map to the last character, the second to the second last, and so on.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

def decode(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Find distinct characters and sort them
    distinct_sorted_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from encoded characters to original characters
    mapping = {}
    n = len(distinct_sorted_chars)
    for i in range(n):
        mapping[distinct_sorted_chars[i]] = distinct_sorted_chars[n - i - 1]
    
    # Step 3: Decode the encoded string
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    return ''.join(decoded)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = decode(encoded)
        print(decoded)
```

This corrected program follows the described decoding process accurately.
