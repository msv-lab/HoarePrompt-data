You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. It reverses the integers, sorts them, and then constructs a result string by alternating between appending the reversed and non-reversed integers. It then compares this result string with `10` raised to the power of `m`. Depending on the comparison, it prints either 'Sasha' or 'Anna'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Anna's Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate Anna's moves. It only reverses the digits of the numbers and concatenates them without considering the optimal strategy for Anna.
   - Anna can choose any number to reverse, and the program should consider multiple possible reversals and their outcomes.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Sasha's Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate Sasha's moves. It concatenates the reversed numbers without considering all possible pairs and their concatenations.
   - Sasha can choose any two numbers to concatenate in any order, and the program should consider all possible concatenations and their outcomes.

3. **Incorrect Concatenation Logic**:
   - The program concatenates the reversed numbers in a specific order without considering the optimal strategy for Sasha.
   - Sasha can concatenate the numbers in any order, and the program should consider both possible concatenations (e.g., `a_i + a_j` and `a_j + a_i`).

4. **Incorrect Final Comparison**:
   - The program compares the concatenated result with `10^m` but does not correctly simulate the game's progression.
   - The final comparison should be based on the optimal moves of both players, not just the concatenation of reversed numbers.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when the list has only one element, or when all numbers are single-digit.
   - For example, if the list has only one element, Anna wins immediately since Sasha cannot make a move.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the program's incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Anna
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Anna can reverse the number `1` to `1`.
- Sasha can concatenate `9` and `56` to form `956` or `569`.
- Sasha can then concatenate `1` with either `956` or `569` to form `1956`, `9561`, `1569`, or `5691`.
- None of these numbers are greater than or equal to `10^5`, so Anna wins.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
Sasha
```

The program incorrectly determines that Sasha wins, which is not the case based on optimal play by both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
