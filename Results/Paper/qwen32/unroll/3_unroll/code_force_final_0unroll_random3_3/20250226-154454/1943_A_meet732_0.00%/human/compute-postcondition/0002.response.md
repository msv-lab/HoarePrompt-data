The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The integers in the list `a` satisfy the condition `0 ≤ a_i < n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies `0 ≤ a_i < n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
