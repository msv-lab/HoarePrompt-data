Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t representing the starting nodes where the stone is initially put, with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict(list).**

Explanation: The variable `nodes` is now a `defaultdict` of lists, while all other variables retain their initial values.
