The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ends`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `nodes`, `edges`, or `empty`. The only change is the creation of the `ends` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by `nodes`, which is a defaultdict(list) containing adjacency lists for each node, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t representing the starting nodes where the stone is initially put, with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `ends` is an empty list.**
