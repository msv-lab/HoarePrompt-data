The code snippet assigns the value of `s` to the variable `prev`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by `nodes`, which is a defaultdict(list) containing adjacency lists for each node, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t representing the starting nodes where the stone is initially put, with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `ends` is a list containing the two leaf nodes of the tree; `s` and `e` are the two leaf nodes of the tree; `tree` is a list containing the single element `s`; `prev` is `s`.**
