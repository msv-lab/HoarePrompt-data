Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10⁵), and y is 0. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10⁵. Additionally, the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is currently running as the main module.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer input by the user, while the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) and conditions remain unchanged.
