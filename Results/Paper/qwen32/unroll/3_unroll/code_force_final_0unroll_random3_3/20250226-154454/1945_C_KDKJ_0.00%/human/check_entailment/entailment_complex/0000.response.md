### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of their functionalities and how they address the problem:

1. **`func_1`**:
   - **Input**: Reads an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
   - **Process**:
     - Initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]`.
     - Iterates over each character in the string `a`. For each character, it updates the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far and appends this count to the list `S`.
     - After constructing the list `S`, it iterates through possible positions `i` where the road could be built (from 0 to `n-1`).
     - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's to the left (`left`) and the number of '1's to the right (`right`).
     - It checks whether the number of '0's to the left is at least half of the total number of houses to the left (`left * 2 >= lsum`), and similarly for the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
     - If both conditions are met, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position `ans` (or if it is the first valid position found). If so, it updates `ans` to `i`.
   - **Output**: Prints the position `ans` where the road should be built.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - **Input**: No parameters.
   - **Process**: Reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Output**: None (each call to `func_1` handles its own output).

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and handles each one independently.
- **Counting Mechanism**: The list `S` keeps track of cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position, which is used to efficiently determine the number of '0's to the left and '1's to the right for each possible road position.
- **Condition Checking**: For each possible road position, the program checks if the number of '0's to the left and '1's to the right meet the required conditions.
- **Optimization**: It seeks the position closest to the middle of the village that satisfies the conditions, and in case of ties, it selects the smaller position.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently handles the input, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the correct position for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
