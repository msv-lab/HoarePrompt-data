To determine the output state, we need to understand how the loop modifies the list `S` based on the input string `a`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `a`. For each character, it checks if it is '0' or '1'. If it is '0', it increments the first element of the last sublist in `S` by 1. If it is '1', it increments the second element of the last sublist in `S` by 1. After each iteration, it appends the updated sublist to `S`.

Given the initial state `S = [[0, 0]]`, let's consider the effect of the loop:

1. For each '0' in the string `a`, the first element of the last sublist in `S` is incremented by 1.
2. For each '1' in the string `a`, the second element of the last sublist in `S` is incremented by 1.

After the loop finishes, `S` will have `n + 1` sublists, where `n` is the length of the input string `a`. The first sublist `[0, 0]` remains unchanged, and each subsequent sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to that point in the string.

The final sublist in `S` will contain the total count of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`.

Output State: **S is a list of length n+1 where the last element is [count of '0's in a, count of '1's in a].**
