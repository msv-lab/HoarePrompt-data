To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the provided loop code. The loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input and calls the function `func_1()` during each iteration. However, the code snippet does not provide the definition of `func_1()` or the initial state of any variables that might be modified by `func_1()`. 

Given that the problem statement asks us to change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body, and there are no variables explicitly mentioned in the loop head or body other than the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and not used in the loop body), we can infer that the loop itself does not modify any variables outside of its scope.

Since the loop does not affect any variables outside of its body and no variables are defined or modified within the body other than the implicit loop counter `_`, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state with respect to any variables not defined in the loop.

Output State: **No variables in the function signature.**
