Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints an index `ans` which is determined based on the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a`. The index `ans` is chosen such that the number of '0's to the left of `ans` and the number of '1's to the right of `ans` are as balanced as possible relative to the total counts of '0's and '1's in the string.**
