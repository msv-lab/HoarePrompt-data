### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of the array elements through a series of operations that replace subarray segments with their MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value. The solution is broken into three main functions:

1. **`func_1(start_index, end_index)`**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by considering all possible ways to split the subarray and evaluating the MEX operation's potential impact on the sum. It uses memoization to store already computed results for subarrays to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **`func_2(start_index, end_index)`**: This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`. It recursively determines the optimal subarray splits and constructs the operations to transform the array accordingly.

3. **`make_stairs(i)`**: This function is supposed to help in constructing the sequence of operations to make a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where each element `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`. However, the function `make_stairs` has an issue because it references a global variable `res` which is not defined within its scope, leading to a `NameError`.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Global Variable `res` in `make_stairs`**: The function `make_stairs` uses a global variable `res` to store the sequence of operations. Since `res` is not defined in the scope of `make_stairs`, this will result in a `NameError` at runtime. The correct approach would be to pass `res` as an argument to `make_stairs` or define it in the appropriate scope.

### Correctness:
Given the issue with the `make_stairs` function, the program is not correct as it will not execute successfully due to the `NameError`.

**Correctness: False**
