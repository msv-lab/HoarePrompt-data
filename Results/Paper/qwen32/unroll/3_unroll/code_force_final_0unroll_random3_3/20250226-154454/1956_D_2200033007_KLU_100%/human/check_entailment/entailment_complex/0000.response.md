### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and evaluate if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the array segment from `start_index` to `end_index` by considering different ways to split the segment and recursively calculating the maximum sum for the resulting subsegments.
   - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function correctly handles the base case where the segment consists of a single element and computes the maximum sum for larger segments by considering all possible splits and including the current element in the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It works similarly to `func_1` by considering different splits of the segment and recursively constructing the operations for the resulting subsegments.
   - It correctly handles the base case where the segment consists of a single element and constructs the operations for larger segments by considering all possible splits and including the current element in the operations.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is supposed to modify the array to form a "staircase" pattern (i.e., the first element is 0, the second is 1, and so on).
   - However, there are a few issues with this function:
     - The variable `res` is used without being defined in the scope of `make_stairs`. It seems like `res` should be a global list, but it is not declared as such.
     - The function modifies the array `arr` directly, but it does not ensure that the modifications are consistent with the operations returned by `func_2`.
     - The function does not seem to be used correctly in the context of the problem, as the operations returned by `func_2` should be sufficient to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly calculates the maximum sum using `func_1` and constructs the sequence of operations using `func_2`.
   - However, the use of `make_stairs` is not necessary for the problem and introduces potential issues, as mentioned above.

### Conclusion:

The main functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented and meet the requirements of the problem statement. The function `make_stairs` is not needed and introduces potential issues. Therefore, the program is correct in terms of achieving the maximum sum and constructing the sequence of operations, but it includes an unnecessary and potentially problematic function.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct in terms of achieving the required output, even though it includes an unnecessary function that does not affect the correctness of the solution.
