Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`; `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`. The current value of `i` is 0; `res` is a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`**.

In simple terms: The value of `i` remains 0, `is_already_stairs` is still `False`, and `res` now contains one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`.
