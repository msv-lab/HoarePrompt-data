The only objects in the loop head are the variables `suit` and `rank`, which are derived from the `suits.items()` dictionary. For the loop to execute, the `suits` dictionary must contain at least one key-value pair. Since the keys are fixed as 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', the loop will execute if at least one of these keys has a value other than `None`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the `suits` dictionary so that at least one of its values is not `None`.

State: **`trumps` is a list of ranks of trump cards; `answers` is a list of strings representing sorted pairs of non-trump cards; `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key (from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S') having a value that is not `None`**
