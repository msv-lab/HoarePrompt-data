The provided code snippet sorts the `trumps` list. Given the initial state, `trumps` is an empty list `[]` if all non-trump cards were paired. Sorting an empty list remains an empty list. The `answers` and `suits` variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`trumps` is `[]` if all non-trump cards were paired; `answers` will contain the pairs of non-trump and trump cards; `suits` will remain the same as the initial state.**
