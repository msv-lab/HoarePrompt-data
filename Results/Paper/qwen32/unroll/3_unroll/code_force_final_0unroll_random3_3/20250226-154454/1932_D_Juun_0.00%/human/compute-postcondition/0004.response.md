The provided code snippet initializes a dictionary `suits` with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each assigned the value `None`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trump`, `trumps`, or `answers`. The output state will retain the initial states of these variables while `suits` will now have the specified key-value pairs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", and `cards` is a list of 2n unique strings where each string represents a card in the format "<rank><suit>", with rank being one of "23456789" and suit being one of "CDHS"; `trump` is the input character; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', each having the value `None`.**
