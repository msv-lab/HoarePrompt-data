You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:

    #State: For each test case, the output is a line containing the `answer` array constructed by alternating between picking elements from the start and end of the `array` initialized with integers from 1 to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to generate a k-level permutation for each test case. Let's analyze the provided code to see if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an array `array` containing integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Generating the Permutation**:
   - It starts with `answer` initialized to `[1]`.
   - It uses a list `a` initialized to `[1, -1]` to keep track of indices for selecting elements from `array`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n-1` to build the `answer` list.
   - If the current index `i` is odd (`(-1) ** i == -1`), it appends the element at the last index of `a` (which starts at `n`) to `answer` and decrements the last index.
   - If the current index `i` is even, it appends the element at the first index of `a` (which starts at 1) to `answer` and increments the first index.

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the `answer` list for each test case.

### Analysis:

The code does not guarantee that the generated permutation will be a k-level permutation. Here's why:

- The code uses a zigzag pattern to generate the permutation, alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This pattern does not necessarily ensure that the sums of every k-length segment differ by no more than 1.
- For example, consider the test case `n=7, k=4`. The code might generate a permutation like `[1, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5, 4]`. The sums of the k-length segments are `[1+7+2+6=16, 7+2+6+3=18, 2+6+3+5=16, 6+3+5+4=18]`. Here, the maximum sum is 18 and the minimum sum is 16, which does not satisfy the k-level condition since `18 - 16 > 1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
