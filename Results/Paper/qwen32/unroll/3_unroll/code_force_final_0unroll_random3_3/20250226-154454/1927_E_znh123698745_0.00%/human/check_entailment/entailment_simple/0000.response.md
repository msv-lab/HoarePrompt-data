### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to generate a k-level permutation for each test case. However, the logic used in the program does not guarantee that the sum of any k consecutive elements in the permutation will differ by no more than 1. The program alternates between picking elements from the start and end of the array, which does not necessarily result in a k-level permutation.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
    - `array` is initialized as a list of integers from 1 to `n`.
    - `answer` is initialized with the first element of `array`, which is `1`.
    - `a` is initialized as `[1, -1]`.

2. **Building the Answer**:
    - The program iterates from `1` to `n-1` and alternates between picking elements from the start (`a[0]`) and the end (`a[-1]`) of the `array` based on the parity of the index `i`.
    - If `i` is odd, it picks the element at the position `a[-1]` from `array` and decrements `a[-1]`.
    - If `i` is even, it picks the element at the position `a[0]` from `array` and increments `a[0]`.

3. **Output**:
    - The constructed `answer` is printed for each test case.

The key issue is that the alternating picking strategy does not ensure that the sums of any k consecutive elements in the permutation differ by no more than 1. For example, consider the test case `n = 10, k = 4`:

- The `answer` array constructed by the program might be `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`.
- The sums of k consecutive elements are `[1+10+2+9, 10+2+9+3, 2+9+3+8, 9+3+8+4, 3+8+4+7, 8+4+7+5, 4+7+5+6]`, which are `[22, 24, 22, 23, 22, 24, 22]`.
- The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `24 - 22 = 2`, which violates the k-level condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee the construction of a k-level permutation as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
