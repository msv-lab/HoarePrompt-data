You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: The output state consists of a series of responses for each test case. For each string `s`, the program determines if it's possible to split the string into two parts such that the first part is not equal to the second part, or if the string is already unique or symmetrical in a specific way. The responses are printed line by line, indicating whether it's possible ('YES') or not ('NO') to make such a split, and if possible, the number of splits and the resulting parts of the string. The state of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` will vary based on each test case but will not persist beyond the current iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when the string can be partitioned into multiple non-palindrome substrings. Let's analyze the program and provide a counterexample.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Strings with Repeated Characters:**
   - The program correctly identifies strings that are entirely composed of the same character as not being partitionable into non-palindrome substrings.
   - However, it fails to correctly identify cases where a string can be partitioned into multiple non-palindrome substrings.

2. **Handling of Palindromic Strings:**
   - The program correctly identifies strings that are palindromes and cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.
   - However, it does not correctly handle cases where a string can be partitioned into multiple non-palindrome substrings.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input string `abccba`. The program should output `YES` and provide a valid partition into non-palindrome substrings. However, the program will output `NO` for this input string.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The string `abccba` is a palindrome.
- The program checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.
- Since `abccba` is a palindrome, the program will output `NO` because it does not find any non-palindrome substring.
- However, `abccba` can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings such as `abc` and `cba`.

### Correct Output for Counterexample:
```
YES
2
abc cba
```

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when the string can be partitioned into multiple non-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
