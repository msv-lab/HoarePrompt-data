The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if it's possible to split the string into two parts such that the first part is not equal to the second part. If such a split is possible, it outputs 'YES', the number of splits (either 1 or 2), and the resulting parts of the string. If no such split is possible, it outputs 'NO'.
