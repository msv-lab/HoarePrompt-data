The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function.

Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts**
