Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. It returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order, followed by all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in ascending order.**
