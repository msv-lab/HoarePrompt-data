Output State: **The program returns a list that first contains all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order, followed by all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reversed order.**

This output state combines two lists: `output2` and `output1`. `output2` includes divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, sorted in descending order. `output1` includes divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, sorted in reversed order. The final list is a concatenation of these two lists.
