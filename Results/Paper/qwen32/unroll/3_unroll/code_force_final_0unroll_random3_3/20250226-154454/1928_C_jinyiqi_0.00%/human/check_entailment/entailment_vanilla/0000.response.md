Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine how many values of `k` (where `k > 1`) fit the scenario where Vasya, standing in position `n`, receives the number `x` during the "firstâ€“k-th" position settling process.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the position `n` and the number `x`.
3. It initializes an empty list `output` to store valid `k` values.
4. It checks two conditions:
   - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each `s` in the result of `func_1`.
   - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and performs the same checks.
5. It ensures the `output` list contains unique values by converting it to a set and back to a list.
6. It defines `func_1(x)` to find all divisors of `x`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Output Handling**: The program calculates possible `k` values but does not print them. It only stores them in the `output` list, which is never printed.
2. **Logic for Calculating k**: The program attempts to find `k` by checking conditions involving divisors, but the logic is not directly aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` are not sufficient to determine the correct `k` values.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function finds all divisors of `x`. However, the program uses it incorrectly to find `k`. The correct approach would involve understanding the periodic nature of the sequence and checking if `x` appears at position `n` for a given `k`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Understand that the sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. For each possible `k`, determine if `x` appears at position `n` following the described pattern.
3. Count the number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values. It fails to print the results and uses an incorrect method to find `k`.

**Correctness: False**
