Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incomplete Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a number, but it is not defined in the given code snippet. The function `func_1` is referenced in the code, but it is not implemented, leading to a `NameError`.

2. **Logic Errors in Conditionals**: The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are not correctly checking the constraints for `k`. The logic does not correctly determine the possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints.

3. **Handling of Output**: The output list is not being used correctly. The program should collect all valid `k` values and then print the count of these values for each test case. The current implementation does not print anything, and the output list is not being used to store and count valid `k` values.

4. **Type Handling**: The division `(s + 2) / 2` should be an integer division `(s + 2) // 2` to ensure `k` is an integer.

5. **Range of k**: The code does not correctly handle the range of `k` values that need to be checked. The problem requires checking `k` values greater than 1, and the logic should account for this.

6. **Final Output**: The program does not print the number of valid `k` values for each test case, which is required by the problem statement.

To correct the program, the function `func_1` needs to be properly defined, the logic for determining valid `k` values needs to be corrected, and the output should be handled appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_divisors(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for s in find_divisors(n + x - 2):
        k = (s + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and k >= x:
            count += 1
    for s in find_divisors(n - x):
        k = (s + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and k >= x:
            count += 1
    print(count)
```

This corrected version defines the `find_divisors` function, correctly checks for valid `k` values, and prints the count of valid `k` values for each test case.
