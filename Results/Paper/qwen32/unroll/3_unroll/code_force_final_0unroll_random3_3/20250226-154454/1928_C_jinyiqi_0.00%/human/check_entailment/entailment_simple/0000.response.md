### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) for which Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) during the settling process are consistent with the described pattern.

The program follows these main steps:

1. **Input Parsing:** It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya.
2. **Condition Checking:** It checks two conditions:
   - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calculates divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) using the `func_1` function and checks if they can form valid \( k \) values.
   - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calculates divisors of \( n - x \) using the `func_1` function and checks if they can form valid \( k \) values.
3. **Divisor Calculation:** The `func_1` function calculates all divisors of a given number \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
4. **Validation:** For each divisor found, it checks if it can be a valid \( k \) by ensuring that \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
5. **Output:** It collects all valid \( k \) values, removes duplicates, and outputs the count of these values.

### Analysis:

- **Condition Checking:** The conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) are used to determine if the divisor calculations are meaningful. These conditions ensure that \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even, which is necessary for the divisor calculations to yield valid \( k \) values.
- **Divisor Calculation:** The `func_1` function correctly calculates all divisors of a number and returns them in the required order.
- **Validation:** The validation step ensures that only valid \( k \) values are considered. Specifically, \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that \( s + 2 \) is even, and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \) ensures that the resulting \( k \) is at least \( x \), which is necessary because the numbers assigned during the settling process are in the range from 1 to \( k \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
