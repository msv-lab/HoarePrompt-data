### Reasoning:

The given program aims to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing a series of operations. The program calculates a sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum. Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the matrix elements for each test case.
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it adds \( n \times (n + 1) / 2 \) to the sum if \( n \times (n + 1) / 2 \) is greater than \( i \times n \). Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to the sum.
   - This logic seems incorrect because the sum of all elements in the matrix should be maximized by filling the matrix with the highest possible values, which are the numbers from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column.

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program calculates the number of operations as \( n + r \), where \( r \) is derived from the sum calculation. This number of operations is supposed to be no more than \( 2n \).
   - The operations involve filling rows and columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Operations Description**:
   - The program prints \( n + r \) lines describing the operations.
   - For the first \( n \) operations, it fills each row \( j \) with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].
   - For the remaining \( r \) operations, it fills each column \( j \% n \) with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

### Correctness Analysis:

The program's logic for calculating the sum and describing the operations is not aligned with the problem's goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix elements. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Maximizing the Sum**: The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]. This ensures that every element in the matrix is maximized.
- **Sum Calculation**: The correct sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the numbers from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column is \( n \times n \times (n + 1) / 2 \).
- **Number of Operations**: The number of operations required to fill the matrix in this manner is \( 2n \) (filling each row and each column once).

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or describe the operations needed to achieve this sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
