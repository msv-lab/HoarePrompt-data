Reasoning:

The given program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by calculating the maximum sum of the matrix and the operations needed to achieve this sum. However, there are a few issues with the logic and the implementation:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation logic in the program is incorrect. The program is trying to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the sum for the first `r` rows and `i * n` for the remaining rows. This logic does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix.

   The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The maximum sum for a single row or column is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Since there are `n` rows and `n` columns, and each number from 1 to `n` appears exactly once in each row and each column, the maximum sum of the matrix is `n * n * (n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Operations**: The operations described in the output do not correctly fill the matrix to achieve the maximum sum. The program is printing `n + r` operations, but it does not ensure that each row and each column contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

   To achieve the maximum sum, we can perform `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations, each using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This will ensure that each row and each column contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, resulting in the maximum sum.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
