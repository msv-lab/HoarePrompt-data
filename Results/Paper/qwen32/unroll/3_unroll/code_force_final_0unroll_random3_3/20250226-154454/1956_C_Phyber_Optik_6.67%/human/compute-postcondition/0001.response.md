The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. In Python, the underscore `_` is a conventional name for a variable that is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the `range(t)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and `t` must be greater than 0**
