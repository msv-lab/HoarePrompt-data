Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, the function processes a matrix of size n x n. The function returns the result of some computation or processing performed on each matrix. The total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided first, followed by the matrices for each test case. The sum of the squares of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
