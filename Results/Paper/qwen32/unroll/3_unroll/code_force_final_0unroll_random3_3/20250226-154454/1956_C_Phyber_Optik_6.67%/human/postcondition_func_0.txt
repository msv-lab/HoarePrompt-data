The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it computes a sum based on the value of `n` and prints this sum along with `n + r`, where `r` is derived from the computation. It then prints `n + r` lines describing matrix operations, which involve printing specific row indices and the numbers 1 through `n`.
