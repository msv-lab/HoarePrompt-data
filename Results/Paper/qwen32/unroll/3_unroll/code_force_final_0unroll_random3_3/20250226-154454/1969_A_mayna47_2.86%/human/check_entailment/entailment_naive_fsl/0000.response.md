Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for all possible scenarios where the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least two friends attend the party may be different from 2 or 3.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Handling `n == 2`**: The program correctly prints `2` for `n == 2` because in this case, Monocarp must invite both friends to ensure at least two friends attend.

2. **Checking for Triangles**: The program then checks if there exists a triplet `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet is found, it prints `2` because inviting two members of this triplet ensures that two friends attend the party.

3. **Default Case**: If no such triplet is found, the program defaults to printing `3`.

However, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases where the minimum number of invitations required could be more than 2 but less than 3. For example, consider the following test case:

```
4
4
2 3 4 1
```

In this case, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2. Friend 1 and friend 2 will attend because they are each other's best friends, and both have invitations. Friend 3 and friend 4 will not attend because their best friends (friend 4 and friend 1, respectively) do not have invitations. Thus, the minimum number of invitations required is 2.

The program will incorrectly print `3` for this case because it does not find a triplet `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
