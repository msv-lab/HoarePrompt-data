Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. Specifically, it only checks for a specific condition where `v[v[v[i]]] == i` to determine if 2 invitations are enough, which is not sufficient to guarantee that at least 2 friends will come to the party. 

The logic should be more robust to handle all possible configurations of best friends and ensure that the minimum number of invitations required to bring at least 2 friends to the party is calculated correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

1. Identify cycles in the best-friend relationships.
2. Determine the minimum number of invitations needed based on the cycles.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_cycles(n, v):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    cycles = []
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = v[x]
            cycles.append(cycle)
    
    return cycles

def min_invitations(cycles):
    invitations = 0
    
    for cycle in cycles:
        if len(cycle) == 2:
            invitations += 2
        else:
            invitations += (len(cycle) + 1) // 2
    
    return invitations

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    cycles = find_cycles(n, v)
    invitations = min_invitations(cycles)
    
    # Ensure at least 2 friends come to the party
    if invitations < 2:
        invitations = 2
    
    print(invitations)
```

This program correctly identifies cycles in the best-friend relationships and calculates the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
