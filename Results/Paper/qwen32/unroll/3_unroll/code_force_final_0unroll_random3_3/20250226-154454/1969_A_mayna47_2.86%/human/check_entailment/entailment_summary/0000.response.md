### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a triplet relationship `v[v[v[i]]] == i` in the list of best friends. If such a relationship is found, it implies that Monocarp can invite two friends such that both come to the party, and hence, it prints `2`. If no such triplet relationship is found, it defaults to printing `3`.

However, the problem requires us to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The current logic does not fully cover all possible scenarios for achieving this minimum number of invitations.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the current program may not be correct:

1. **Triplet Check (`v[v[v[i]]] == i`)**: 
   - This check is designed to find a cycle of length 3 in the list of best friends, which would allow Monocarp to invite 2 friends who will both come to the party. However, this is only one specific scenario.
   - There are other configurations where Monocarp can invite fewer than 3 friends but still have at least 2 friends come to the party. For example, if there is a cycle of length 4, Monocarp can invite 2 friends from this cycle, and both will come.

2. **Default Case (`print(3)`)**:
   - If no triplet relationship is found, the program defaults to printing `3`. However, this is not always correct. For example, if there are two separate cycles of length 2 (i.e., two pairs of friends who are each other's best friends), Monocarp can invite one friend from each pair, and both will come to the party. This scenario would require only 2 invitations, not 3.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all possible configurations that could result in fewer than 3 invitations being necessary. Therefore, it is not guaranteed to always produce the correct minimum number of invitations.

### Correctness: **False**
