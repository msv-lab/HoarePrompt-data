Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for finding two different elements within a given range for each query. The approach taken in the program is to preprocess the array into segments of consecutive equal elements and then try to find a pair of different elements based on these segments. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. The program incorrectly uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after `l`. This can lead to incorrect segment identification, especially when the segment starts exactly at `l`.

2. The logic for determining whether a valid pair exists within the range `[l, r]` is flawed. The program does not correctly handle cases where the first segment starts before `l` and the second segment starts after `l`.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where there are only one or two elements in the range `[l, r]` and they are the same.

4. The program does not correctly handle the case where the segment identified by `bisect_left` ends before `r` and there is no subsequent segment to compare with.

Here's a more straightforward and correct approach to solve the problem:

For each query, simply iterate through the range `[l, r]` and find the first two different elements. This approach is efficient given the constraints and ensures correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def main():
    input = stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    tc = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, input[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        q = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            l -= 1
            r -= 1
            found = False
            for i in range(l, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r + 1):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        print(i + 1, j + 1)
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly handles all cases by directly checking pairs within the specified range for each query.
