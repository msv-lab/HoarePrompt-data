To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the code:

1. The loop iterates `N + 1` times, where `N` is the length of the initial list `nums` (excluding the appended `-1`).
2. The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of `nums`.
3. During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element `nums[i]` is different from `num`.
4. If they are different, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr` and updates `s` to `i`.
5. Regardless of the condition, `num` is updated to `nums[i]` at the end of each iteration.

Let's break this down step by step with an example:

Suppose `nums` is `[2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]` (where `-1` is appended). Here, `N` is 5.

- **Initialization:**
  - `t` = (some integer between 1 and 10^4)
  - `N` = 5
  - `nums` = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]
  - `s` = 0
  - `e` = 0
  - `num` = 2
  - `arr` = []

- **Iteration 1 (i = 0):**
  - `nums[0]` = 2, which is equal to `num`.
  - No change to `arr`, `s`, or `num`.

- **Iteration 2 (i = 1):**
  - `nums[1]` = 2, which is equal to `num`.
  - No change to `arr`, `s`, or `num`.

- **Iteration 3 (i = 2):**
  - `nums[2]` = 3, which is not equal to `num`.
  - Append `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr` -> `(1 + 0, 2, 2)` -> `(1, 2, 2)`.
  - Update `s` to `i` -> `s = 2`.
  - Update `num` to `nums[2]` -> `num = 3`.

- **Iteration 4 (i = 3):**
  - `nums[3]` = 3, which is equal to `num`.
  - No change to `arr`, `s`, or `num`.

- **Iteration 5 (i = 4):**
  - `nums[4]` = 3, which is equal to `num`.
  - No change to `arr`, `s`, or `num`.

- **Iteration 6 (i = 5):**
  - `nums[5]` = -1, which is not equal to `num`.
  - Append `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr` -> `(1 + 2, 5, 3)` -> `(3, 5, 3)`.
  - Update `s` to `i` -> `s = 5`.
  - Update `num` to `nums[5]` -> `num = -1`.

After the loop finishes, the state of the variables is:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `nums` remains unchanged.
- `s` is 5.
- `e` remains unchanged (0).
- `num` is -1.
- `arr` is `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 5, 3)]`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; N is an integer assigned the value of the first test case from the input; nums is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional element -1 appended to it; s is 5; e is 0; num is -1; arr is [(1, 2, 2), (3, 5, 3)].**
