The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, and `N` is an integer assigned the value of the first test case from the input.

The variable `nums` is introduced and assigned a list of integers obtained from the input. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer assigned the value of the first test case from the input; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
