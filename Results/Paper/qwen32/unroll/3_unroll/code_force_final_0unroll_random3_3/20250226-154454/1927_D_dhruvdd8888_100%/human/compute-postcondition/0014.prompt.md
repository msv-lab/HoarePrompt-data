You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, there are two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all q across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; N is an integer assigned the value of the first test case from the input; nums is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional element -1 appended to it; s is 5; e is 0; num is -1; arr is [(1, 2, 2), (3, 5, 3)].
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer assigned the value of the first test case from the input; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional element -1 appended to it; `s` is 5; `e` is 0; `num` is -1; `arr` is [(1, 2, 2), (3, 5, 3)]; `LA` is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000. Additionally, it receives an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and for each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function processes these inputs and returns the results of the queries, which are not further specified in the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
