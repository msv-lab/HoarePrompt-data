Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`. For each test case, it outputs specific pairs of numbers based on the value of `n`. It always outputs `1 1` and `1 2`. If `n` is 3, it outputs `2 3`. If `n` is greater than 3, it outputs `2 4` followed by `j j` for each `j` from 4 to `n`.**
