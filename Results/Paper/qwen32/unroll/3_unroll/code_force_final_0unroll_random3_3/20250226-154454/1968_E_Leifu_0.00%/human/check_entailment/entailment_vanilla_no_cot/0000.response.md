Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements:

1. **For \(n = 2\):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - This is correct and gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).

2. **For \(n = 3\):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - This is correct and gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

3. **For \(n \geq 4\):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     5 5
     ...
     n n
     ```
   - This is incorrect because it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     ```
   - This gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 5\}\), which only has 4 distinct Manhattan distances. However, it is possible to achieve 6 distinct Manhattan distances for \(n = 4\).

The program needs to be modified to ensure that it maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). A better approach would be to place the points in a pattern that maximizes the variety of distances, such as placing them along the perimeter of the grid or using a spiral pattern.

Given the above analysis, the program is not correct for all values of \(n\), and thus the response is:

Correctness: **False**
