The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to a new variable `nn`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `factors` is still an empty dictionary. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `factors` is an empty dictionary; `nn` is a positive integer greater than 1.**
