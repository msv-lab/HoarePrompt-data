To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly computes the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around the bitwise XOR of the sequence. Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero, and Bob wins if it is zero. Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins by strategically removing numbers.

### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR of an even number of the same number is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of the same number is the number itself.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave an even number of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) in the sequence when possible, because the XOR of an even number of the same number is zero.
   - If there is an odd number of a particular number, Eve should try to remove it to make the count even.

3. **Counting Bob's Wins**:
   - Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - This happens when the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) in the remaining sequence is even.
   - The problem is essentially asking for the maximum number of times Eve can remove numbers such that the remaining numbers have even counts.

### Program Analysis:
The given program computes the maximum number of times Bob can win using the following logic:
- For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), it calculates how many pairs can be formed (`x // 2`), and if there is a single number left (`x % 2`).
- It then sums up these values, considering only the first three types (1, 2, 3) for some reason (`x % 2 * (i < 3)`).
- Finally, it divides the sum by 3 and prints the result.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples.

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3)) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Result: `0 // 3 = 0` (Incorrect, Bob wins once initially)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (3 < 3)) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5`
   - Result: `5 // 3 = 1` (Correct)

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3)) = 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9`
   - Result: `9 // 3 = 3` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3)) = 5 + 5 + 3 + 0 = 13`
   - Result: `13 // 3 = 4` (Incorrect, Bob wins three times)

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (3 < 3)) = 0 + 14 + 14 + 14 = 42`
   - Result: `42 // 3 = 14` (Incorrect, Bob wins twelve times)

### Conclusion:
The logic in the provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of times Bob can win. The program seems to be using an incorrect formula and does not account for all possible scenarios correctly.

**Correctness: False**
