You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ans1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        x = func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)
        if x == '<':
            ans1 = i
    mx = 0
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        x = func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)
        if x == '<':
            v = []
            mx = i
            v.append(i)
        elif x == '=':
            v.append(i)
    mx = v[0]
    ans = v[0]
    for i in range(1, len(v)):
        x = func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])
        if x == '>':
            ans = v[i]
    print('!', ans, ans1)

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    return input()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and prints a query to compare the bitwise OR of the elements at positions `a` and `b` with the bitwise OR of the elements at positions `c` and `d` in a secret permutation `p`. It then returns the value provided by the user input as a result of this query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. There are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` for XOR Comparison**: The program uses `func_1` to compare bitwise OR operations, not XOR. The goal is to maximize the XOR operation, not the OR operation. The XOR operation is crucial to finding the maximum difference between two numbers in terms of their bit representation.

2. **Logic Flaws in Finding Maximum XOR**: The program tries to find the maximum XOR by comparing OR results, which is not the correct approach. It should compare the XOR of pairs directly, or use a strategy that indirectly helps in finding the maximum XOR by analyzing OR results in a way that can help deduce the XOR.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Equal OR Results**: The program does not handle the case where the OR results are equal correctly. It resets the list `v` and sets `mx` to the current index, but this does not guarantee that the maximum XOR will be found.

4. **Potential for Infinite Loop or Incorrect Output**: The program does not guarantee that it will always find the correct pair within the allowed number of queries (3n). The logic used might not explore all possible pairs sufficiently to ensure the maximum XOR is found.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach involving binary search on bits or using properties of XOR to reduce the number of queries is necessary. The current program does not follow the problem description accurately and might fail for various test cases where the maximum XOR is not found due to the incorrect use of OR comparisons and flawed logic.
