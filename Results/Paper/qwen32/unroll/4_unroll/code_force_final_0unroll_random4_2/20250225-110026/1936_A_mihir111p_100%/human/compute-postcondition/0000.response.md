The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('?', a, b, c, d)
```

Based on the initial state provided:
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers such that \( 0 \leq a, b, c, d < n \), where \( n \) is the length of the secret permutation `p`.

This means that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are indices within the range of the permutation `p`, but the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

The `print` statement will output a question mark followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)**
