The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, `n` and `k`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `n` and `k` are not specified, but after the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6. After execution, `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the input.**
