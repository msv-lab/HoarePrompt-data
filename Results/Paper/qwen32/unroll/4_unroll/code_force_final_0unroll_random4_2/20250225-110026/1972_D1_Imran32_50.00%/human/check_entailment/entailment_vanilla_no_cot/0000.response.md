Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not check the condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The logic inside `func_1` seems to be unrelated to the problem's requirements. 

To solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the given condition holds. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

This program correctly iterates through all pairs `(a, b)` and checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.
