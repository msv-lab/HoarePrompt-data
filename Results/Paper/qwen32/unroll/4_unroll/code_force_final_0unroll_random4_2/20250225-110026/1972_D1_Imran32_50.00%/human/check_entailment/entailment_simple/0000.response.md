Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The program defines a function `func_1` which is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions but the implementation inside the function is incorrect. 

The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, but the problem requires reading `n` and `m`. The function then calculates `ans` based on a formula that is not related to the problem's conditions. Specifically, it calculates `ans` as `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from `2` to `root`, where `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This formula does not solve the problem of finding pairs (a, b) such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The correct approach to solve the problem involves iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and checking if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied. However, this brute-force approach would be inefficient given the constraints. A more efficient solution would involve mathematical insights or optimizations to reduce the number of checks.

Since the provided function does not correctly implement the required logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
