To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the modifications made to the variable `ans` within the loop. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = root` (inclusive), and for each `i`, it calculates a value `cnt` as `i * i` and then updates `ans` by adding the result of `(n + i) // cnt`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.
   - `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = root`.
   - For each iteration, `cnt` is set to `i * i`.
   - `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt`.

3. **Effect on `ans`**:
   - The value of `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `(n + i)` by `cnt` for each `i` from `2` to `root`.

After the loop completes, the final value of `ans` is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from `2` to `root`.

**Output State**: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from `2` to `root`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**

Therefore, the output state in the required format is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from `2` to `root`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
