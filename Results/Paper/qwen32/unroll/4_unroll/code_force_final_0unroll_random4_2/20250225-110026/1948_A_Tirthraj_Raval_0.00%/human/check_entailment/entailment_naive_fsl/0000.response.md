Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program incorrectly handles the case when `n` is odd. According to the problem description, a string is valid if it contains exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program currently only prints "YES" and constructs a string when `n` is even, and "NO" when `n` is odd. However, it is possible to construct a valid string with an odd number of special characters.

For example, consider `n = 1`. A valid string would be "AA", where the first 'A' is special because it is equal to its right neighbor, and the second 'A' is not special. Another example is `n = 3`, where a valid string could be "AABAA", with special characters at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Thus, the program should be able to handle cases where `n` is odd and construct a valid string in those cases as well. The current implementation incorrectly returns "NO" for odd `n`, making it incorrect for those cases.
