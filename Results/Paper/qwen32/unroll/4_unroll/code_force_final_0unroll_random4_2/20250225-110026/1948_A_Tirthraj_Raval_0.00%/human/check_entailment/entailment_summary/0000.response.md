### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. A special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The program follows this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in such a string (each special character must be part of a pair with a different character on one side and the same character on the other, thus requiring an even number of special characters).
4. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. This pattern ensures that every character in the string (except the first and last) is a special character, and there are exactly `n` such special characters.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements. The pattern generated (`ABAB...`) will indeed have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even.
