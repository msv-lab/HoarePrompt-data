Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in it. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Key Points:
1. **Special Character Definition**: A character is special if it is different from one neighbor and the same as the other.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - The number of test cases `t` can be up to 50.
   - The number of special characters `n` can be up to 50.
3. **Output Requirements**:
   - If no suitable string can be constructed, output "NO".
   - Otherwise, output "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's not possible to have an odd number of special characters in such a way that each special character is part of a pair.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string by alternating pairs of characters ('A' and 'B') and prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - The program correctly identifies that an odd number of special characters cannot be formed under the given constraints and outputs "NO".
2. **Even `n` Case**:
   - The program constructs a string by alternating 'A' and 'B' pairs, which ensures that each pair contributes exactly 2 special characters (one 'A' and one 'B').
   - For example, for `n = 6`, the string "AABBAA" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, which matches the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles both the odd and even cases for `n` and constructs a valid string when `n` is even. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
