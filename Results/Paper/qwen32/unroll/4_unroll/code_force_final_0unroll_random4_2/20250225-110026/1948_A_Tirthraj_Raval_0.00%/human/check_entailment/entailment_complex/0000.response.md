### Reasoning:

The program correctly handles the problem requirements by checking if the number of special characters `n` is even or odd. 

- If `n` is odd, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string of uppercase Latin letters where special characters are defined as characters that are equal to exactly one of their neighbors. This is because every special character must have a non-special neighbor, and this setup can only be maintained in pairs, leading to an even count of special characters.

- If `n` is even, the program outputs "YES" and constructs a string with alternating 'A' and 'B' characters repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. For example, if `n` is 6, the string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters, as described in the problem statement.

The program also adheres to the constraints provided in the problem, such as handling up to 50 test cases and ensuring the output string length does not exceed 200 characters, which is easily satisfied by the construction method used.

### Correctness: **True**
