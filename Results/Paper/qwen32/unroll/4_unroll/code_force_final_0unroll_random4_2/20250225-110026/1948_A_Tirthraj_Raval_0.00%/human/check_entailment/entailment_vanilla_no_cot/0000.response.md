Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it incorrectly handles the case when `n` is odd. The problem statement specifies that a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program incorrectly claims that there is no suitable string when `n` is odd, but it is actually possible to construct such a string for any `n`.

For example, for `n = 1`, a valid string is "ABA" (where 'B' is the special character). For `n = 3`, a valid string is "ABACABA" (where 'B', 'C', and the second 'A' are the special characters).

Here's a corrected version of the program that handles both even and odd values of `n`:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('ABA')
        elif n % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('A' * (n // 2 + 1) + 'B' * (n // 2 + 1) + 'A')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))

func()
```

This corrected program handles the case when `n` is odd by constructing a string with the appropriate number of special characters.
