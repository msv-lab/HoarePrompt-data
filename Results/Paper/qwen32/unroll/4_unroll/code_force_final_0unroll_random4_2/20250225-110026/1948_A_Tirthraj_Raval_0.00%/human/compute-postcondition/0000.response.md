Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an input integer. The constraints on `t` (1 <= `t` <= 50) remain valid. The information about the `n` values for each test case is still valid but not yet changed by this code snippet.
