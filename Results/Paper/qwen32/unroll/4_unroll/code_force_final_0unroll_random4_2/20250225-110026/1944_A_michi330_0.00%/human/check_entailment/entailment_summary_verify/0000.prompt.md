You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n - 1`. The function does not modify the input values `n` and `k` but outputs a result for each test case based on the comparison between `k` and `n - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. Let's analyze the logic and identify the potential issues.

The current logic in the program is:
- If the number of bridges that can be destroyed (`k`) is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it prints `1` because Dominater can disconnect all other islands from island 1.
- Otherwise, it prints `n - 1`, implying that Dominater can only disconnect `k` other islands, leaving `n - k - 1` islands reachable, but this logic is incorrect.

### Analysis of the Problem:
Dominater's optimal strategy is to disconnect as many islands from island 1 as possible. To do that, Dominater needs to break the connections in such a way that the maximum number of islands are isolated from island 1. Here's the correct approach:
- Dominater can disconnect `n - 1` islands from island 1 by destroying `n - 1` bridges. This would leave only island 1 reachable.
- If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Dominater can only disconnect `k` islands, leaving `n - k` islands reachable (including island 1).

### Correct Logic:
- If `k >= n - 1`, Everule can only visit island 1.
- If `k < n - 1`, Everule can visit `n - k` islands.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - k)

# Example Input:
# 6
# 2 0
# 2 1
# 4 1
# 5 10
# 5 3
# 4 4

# Example Output:
# 2
# 1
# 4
# 1
# 3
# 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original program incorrectly calculates the number of reachable islands when `k < n - 1`. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
