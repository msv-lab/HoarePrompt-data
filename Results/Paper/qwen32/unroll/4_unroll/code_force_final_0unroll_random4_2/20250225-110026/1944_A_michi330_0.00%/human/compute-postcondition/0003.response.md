Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` for each test case. `n` represents the number of elements, and `k` represents a specific count related to the elements. The function processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
