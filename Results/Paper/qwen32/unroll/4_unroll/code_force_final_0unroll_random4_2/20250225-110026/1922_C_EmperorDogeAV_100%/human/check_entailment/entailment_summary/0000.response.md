### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the `func_1` function to ensure the program meets the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It also reads the queries to determine the pairs of cities between which the minimum travel cost must be calculated.

2. **Determination of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum travel cost to the closest city for each city (except the last one, which is always 1).
   - The function initializes an array `prog_cities` of size `n-1` to store the minimum travel costs.
   - It iterates through the cities and calculates the distance to the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`).
   - It then assigns the value of 1 to `prog_cities[i]` if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city; otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.
   - This logic is correct based on the problem description.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward travel costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative travel costs from the first city to each city.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative travel costs from the last city to each city.
   - These prefix sums are used to efficiently compute the total travel cost for any given query.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program determines the travel cost based on whether the starting city is before or after the ending city.
   - If the starting city `a` is before the ending city `b`, it uses the forward prefix sums.
   - If the starting city `a` is after the ending city `b`, it uses the backward prefix sums.
   - The travel cost is calculated as the difference between the prefix sums at the ending and starting cities.

5. **Execution Summary**:
   - The summary indicates that the function `func_1` correctly determines the minimum travel cost to the closest city for each city.
   - The prefix sums are used to efficiently compute the total travel cost for any given query.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently computes the minimum travel cost for each query using prefix sums and the closest city information. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
