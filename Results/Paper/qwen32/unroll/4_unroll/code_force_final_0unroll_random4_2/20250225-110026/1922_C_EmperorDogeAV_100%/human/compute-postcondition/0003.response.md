Output State: **The program returns `prog_cities`, which is a list where `prog_cities[0]` is the distance between the first and second city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (1 to n-3), `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 (if the distance to the next city is smaller) or the distance to the next city.**
