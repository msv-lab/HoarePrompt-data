You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_i where each a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one a_i that equals 1.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged; `n` and `a` are not part of the output state as they are redefined in each iteration. The final printed results are the trimmed lists and the counts of zeros for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to move chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of moves. Each move involves shifting a chip to the closest free cell to its left.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells (0 for free, 1 for a chip).

2. **Trimming Free Cells:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing free cells by using `pop(0)` and `pop()` respectively. This is correct because leading and trailing free cells do not affect the minimum number of moves to form a contiguous block of chips.

3. **Counting Moves:**
   - After trimming, the program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the remaining list `a`. This count represents the minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block of chips.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of free cells for each test case, which is the minimum number of moves.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After trimming: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Free cells count: `1`
   - Expected output: `1`
   - Program output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After trimming: `1`
   - Free cells count: `0`
   - Expected output: `0`
   - Program output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After trimming: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Free cells count: `0`
   - Expected output: `0`
   - Program output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After trimming: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Free cells count: `2`
   - Expected output: `2`
   - Program output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After trimming: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Free cells count: `3`
   - Expected output: `3`
   - Program output: `3` (Correct)

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the problem's requirements.
