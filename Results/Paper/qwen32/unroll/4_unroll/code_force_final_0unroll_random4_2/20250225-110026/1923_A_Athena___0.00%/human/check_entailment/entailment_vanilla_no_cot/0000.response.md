Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. The program simply counts the number of free cells within the range of the first and last chip, but it does not account for the fact that chips can only move to the closest free cell to their left. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros**: The program removes leading and trailing zeros, which is correct, but this alone does not solve the problem.

2. **Counting Free Cells**: The program counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip. However, this count does not represent the minimum number of moves required because a chip can only move to the closest free cell to its left. This means that if there are multiple free cells between chips, the chips can move to these cells in a way that minimizes the total number of moves.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The program prints the list of cells after trimming leading and trailing zeros, which is not part of the required output.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to calculate the number of moves each chip needs to make to move to the closest free cell to its left. This involves iterating through the cells and keeping track of the number of free cells encountered so far. For each chip, the number of moves it needs to make is equal to the number of free cells encountered before it.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        free_count = 0
        moves = 0
        for cell in a:
            if cell == 0:
                free_count += 1
            else:
                moves += free_count
        print(moves)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly compute the minimum number of moves required to group all chips into a single block.
