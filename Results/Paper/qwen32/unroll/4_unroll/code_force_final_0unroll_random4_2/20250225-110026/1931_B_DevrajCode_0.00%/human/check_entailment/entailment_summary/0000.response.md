### Reasoning:

The program provided is attempting to solve the problem by checking if it is possible to redistribute the water in such a way that all containers have the same amount of water. The key logic used in the function `func_1` is as follows:

1. **Calculate the Target Amount**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have after redistribution, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers (`total_water // n`).

2. **Simulate Redistribution**: It then simulates the process of redistribution by iterating through the containers and keeping track of the cumulative difference between the actual amount of water and the target amount (`container += water - target`).

3. **Check Feasibility**: If at any point during this simulation, the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that it would not be possible to redistribute the water from the previous containers to the current container to reach the target amount, and the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without the cumulative difference going negative, it returns 'Yes'.

The logic is fundamentally correct because it ensures that at each step, the water can be redistributed in a way that maintains the possibility of achieving the target amount in all containers by the end. If at any point the cumulative difference is negative, it implies that there is not enough water in the previous containers to meet the target for the current container, which makes it impossible to achieve the goal.

However, there is a critical issue with the program: the input reading and parsing are incorrect. The program reads the entire input at once and attempts to process it as a single test case. It does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The correct approach would be to read and process each test case separately.

### Correctness:
Despite the logical correctness of the redistribution logic, the program's structure for handling multiple test cases is incorrect. Thus, the program as given does not correctly handle the input format described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
