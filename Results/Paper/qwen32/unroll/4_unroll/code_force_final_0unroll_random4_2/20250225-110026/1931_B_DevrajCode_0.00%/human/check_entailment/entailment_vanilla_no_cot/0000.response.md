Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and then tries to parse it. It assumes that the first number is the number of test cases `t`, and the rest of the numbers are part of the test cases. However, it does not correctly parse the input for multiple test cases. It should process each test case separately.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(n, a)` is called before it is defined, which will cause a `NameError`.

3. **Logic for Checking Feasibility**: The logic in `func_1` is correct for a single test case, but the program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly, processes each test case separately, and then prints the results.
