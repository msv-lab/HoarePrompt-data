### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, with the condition that we can only pour water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container ends up with the same amount. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Calculate Total Water and Target:**
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers (`total_water`).
   - Since it is guaranteed that `total_water` is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water for each container is `target = total_water // n`.

2. **Check Redistribution Feasibility:**
   - The program then iterates through the list of containers and maintains a `container` variable that keeps track of the cumulative difference between the actual water in the containers and the target water level.
   - For each container, it updates `container` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target water level (`water - target`).
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that we have more water removed than added up to that point, which implies that we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount of water using the given operation. In this case, the program returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to redistribute the water, and the program returns 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there is only one container (`n = 1`), in which case it trivially returns 'Yes'.
   - The program also handles cases where the sum of water in all containers is zero, which is a special case of the general logic.

### Correctness:

The logic in the program is correct. The key insight is that if we can redistribute the water such that the cumulative difference never goes negative, then it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. This is because any negative cumulative difference would imply that we would need to "borrow" water from a future container, which is not allowed by the operation constraints.

Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
