Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `a` and `k` is a target value. It also receives a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided values of `n`, `k`, and `a`.**
