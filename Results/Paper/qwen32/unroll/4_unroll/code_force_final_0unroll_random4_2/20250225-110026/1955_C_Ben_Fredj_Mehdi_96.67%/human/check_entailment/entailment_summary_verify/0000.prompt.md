You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a long integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints a specific value based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`. The printed value is determined by a series of conditional checks and a final computation that counts the number of zeros in the modified list `a` after performing a series of decrement operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code contains several hardcoded conditions that do not align with the problem description. The program is not a general solution for the problem but instead seems to handle specific test cases with hardcoded outputs. This approach does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 10
1 1 1
```
According to the problem description, the Kraken will attack the ships in the following order:
1. Attack the first ship (durability becomes 0, ship sinks). Remaining ships: [1, 1]
2. Attack the last ship (durability becomes 0, ship sinks). Remaining ships: [1]
3. Attack the first ship (durability becomes 0, ship sinks). Remaining ships: []
4. No ships left to attack.

In this case, all 3 ships should sink. However, the provided code does not handle this scenario correctly and would likely output an incorrect result due to the hardcoded conditions or the logic used.

Another issue is the handling of large values of `k`. The code checks for specific large values of `k` and returns hardcoded results, which is not a general solution. For example, if `k` is a very large number, the code should correctly determine how many ships will sink based on their initial durability, not return a hardcoded value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for all possible inputs and instead relies on hardcoded conditions for specific test cases.
