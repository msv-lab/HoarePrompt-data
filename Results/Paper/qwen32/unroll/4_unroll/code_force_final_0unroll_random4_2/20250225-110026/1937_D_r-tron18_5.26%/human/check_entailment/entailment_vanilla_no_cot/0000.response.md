Correctness: **False**

The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem using some form of prefix and suffix sums, but the logic does not align with the problem requirements. The approach appears overly complex and does not correctly simulate the pinball movement and the inversion of characters as described in the problem. The function `func_1` and the logic in `func_2` do not accurately reflect the rules of the pinball movement and the inversion of characters.

A correct solution would involve simulating the pinball movement for each starting position, keeping track of the time steps, and inverting the characters as the pinball moves. This can be achieved using a straightforward simulation approach or by analyzing the pattern of movements and inversions more carefully.

Given the complexity and the lack of clarity in the provided program, it is incorrect for solving the given problem.
