Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` cubes, each with a value `a_i`.
- The `f`-th cube (1-indexed) is Dmitry's favorite.
- The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order.
- The first `k` cubes (0-indexed) are removed.
- We need to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube is always removed, never removed, or may be either removed or left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, and then the list of cube values `a`.
   - It adjusts `f` and `k` to be 0-indexed.

2. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The program stores the value of the favorite cube in `x = a[f]`.
   - It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
   - It compares the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list `a[k]` with `x`:
     - If `a[k] > x`, it means that `x` is among the last `n-k` cubes, so the favorite cube will never be removed. The program prints `'NO'`.
     - If `a[k] < x`, it means that `x` is among the first `k` cubes, so the favorite cube will always be removed. The program prints `'YES'`.
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means that `x` is exactly at the `k`-th position. The program checks if:
       - `k == n - 1`, meaning `x` is the last cube and will not be removed.
       - `a[k + 1] < x`, meaning there are cubes with values less than `x` after `x`, so `x` might be removed.
       - Otherwise, it prints `'MAYBE'`.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly handles the cases where the favorite cube is definitively removed or not removed.
- The case where the favorite cube could be either removed or left is also correctly handled by checking the value of the next cube.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
