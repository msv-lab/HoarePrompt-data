### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly handles the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The index `f` is decremented by 1 to convert it from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
   - The index `k` is also decremented by 1 for the same reason.

3. **Storing the Favorite Cube's Value:**
   - The value of the favorite cube (`x`) is stored from the original list `a`.

4. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program then compares the `k`-th largest element in the sorted list (`a[k]`) with the value of the favorite cube (`x`):
     - If `a[k] > x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely not removed, so it prints "NO".
     - If `a[k] < x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints "YES".
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means the favorite cube could be removed or not removed, depending on the subsequent elements in the sorted list:
       - If `k == n - 1`, it means the `k`-th element is the smallest element being considered, and since `a[k] == x`, the favorite cube is not removed. Thus, it prints "YES".
       - Otherwise, it checks if `a[k + 1] < x`. If true, it means there are more cubes with the same value as the favorite cube that are not removed, so it prints "YES". If `a[k + 1] == x`, it means the favorite cube could still be removed or not removed, so it prints "MAYBE".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given scenarios and edge cases as described in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether the favorite cube is removed, not removed, or may be either removed or not removed based on the sorted list of cube values.

**Correctness: True**
