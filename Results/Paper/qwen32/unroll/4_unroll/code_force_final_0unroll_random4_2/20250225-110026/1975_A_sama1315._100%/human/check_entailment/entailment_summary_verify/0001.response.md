### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and function summaries.

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. This operation is equivalent to rotating the array.

**Function `func_1(a)`**:
1. **Sorting**: It creates a sorted version of the array, `sorted_a`.
2. **Concatenation**: It concatenates the array with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This step is crucial as it allows checking all possible rotations of the array.
3. **Window Checking**: It checks every possible "window" of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to see if it matches `sorted_a`. If any such window matches, it means that the array can be rotated to form a sorted array, and the function returns 'Yes'. If no such window is found, it returns 'No'.

**Function `func_2()`**:
1. **Input Reading**: This function reads the input from standard input.
2. **Parsing**: It parses the number of test cases `t`.
3. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
4. **Result Calculation**: It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations and stores the result.
5. **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the idea of checking all possible rotations of the array by leveraging the concatenated version. The function `func_2` correctly handles input parsing and result collection.

Let's verify the given program against the example provided:

- **First Test Case**:
    - Input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
    - Sorted version: `[1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
    - Concatenated version: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
    - Checking all windows of length 6 in the concatenated version does not yield a match with the sorted version.
    - Output: `No` (Correct)

- **Second Test Case**:
    - Input: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
    - Sorted version: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
    - Concatenated version: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
    - Checking all windows of length 5 in the concatenated version yields a match with the sorted version (`[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`).
    - Output: `Yes` (Correct)

- **Third Test Case**:
    - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
    - Sorted version: `[1, 2, 3]`
    - Concatenated version: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
    - Checking all windows of length 3 in the concatenated version yields a match with the sorted version (`[1, 2, 3]`).
    - Output: `Yes` (Correct)

The program correctly handles these test cases, and the logic appears to be sound. It efficiently checks all possible rotations of the array by leveraging the concatenated version of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
