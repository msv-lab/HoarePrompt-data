Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of `n` strings, where each string is the string representation of the corresponding integer in `a`; `idx` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the lists `a` and `data` remain unchanged, and the variable `idx` is initialized to 0.
