Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Concatenation and Subarray Check**:
   - The function `func_1` concatenates the array `a` with itself, resulting in `concatenated_a`.
   - It then checks every possible subarray of length `n` within this concatenated array to see if it matches the sorted version of the original array `sorted_a`.
   - If any such subarray matches `sorted_a`, it means the array can be rotated in such a way that it becomes sorted.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it extracts the array `a`, calls `func_1` to determine if it can be sorted, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints all the results.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of length 2 to 50, as specified in the problem description.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that are already sorted.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that can be sorted by a single rotation.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that cannot be sorted by any number of rotations.

No edge cases or potential inputs were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
