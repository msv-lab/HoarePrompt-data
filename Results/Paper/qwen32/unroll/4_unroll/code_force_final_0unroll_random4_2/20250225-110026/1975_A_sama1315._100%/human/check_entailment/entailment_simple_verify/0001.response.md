### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the solution is correct. The key idea of the program is to check if any rotation of the array can result in a sorted array. By concatenating the array with itself, the program can efficiently check all possible rotations.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
    - **Step 1**: Calculate the length `n` of the array `a`.
    - **Step 2**: Create a sorted version of the array, `sorted_a`.
    - **Step 3**: Concatenate the array with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
    - **Step 4**: Iterate over each possible starting index `i` in `concatenated_a` and check if the subarray of length `n` starting at `i` matches `sorted_a`.
    - **Step 5**: If a match is found, return 'Yes'. If no match is found after checking all possible windows, return 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - **Step 1**: Read the input from standard input.
    - **Step 2**: Parse the number of test cases `t`.
    - **Step 3**: For each test case, read the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
    - **Step 4**: Call `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations and store the result.
    - **Step 5**: After processing all test cases, print the results.

#### Verification:

Let's verify the given program against the example provided:

- **First Test Case**:
    - Input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
    - Sorted version: `[1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
    - Concatenated version: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
    - Checking all windows of length 6 in the concatenated version:
        - `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` (does not match)
        - `[1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1]` (does not match)
        - `[4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1]` (does not match)
        - `[5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4]` (does not match)
        - `[1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5]` (does not match)
        - `[4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1]` (does not match)
    - Output: `No`

- **Second Test Case**:
    - Input: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
    - Sorted version: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
    - Concatenated version: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
    - Checking all windows of length 5 in the concatenated version:
        - `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` (does not match)
        - `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]` (does not match)
        - `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` (matches)
        - `[2, 3, 7, 9, 2]` (does not match)
        - `[3, 7, 9, 2, 2]` (does not match)
        - `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` (does not match)
    - Output: `Yes`

- **Third Test Case**:
    - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
    - Sorted version: `[1, 2, 3]`
    - Concatenated version: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
    - Checking all windows of length 3 in the concatenated version:
        - `[1, 2, 3]` (matches)
        - `[2, 3, 1]` (does not match)
        - `[3, 1, 2]` (does not match)
        - `[1, 2, 3]` (matches)
    - Output: `Yes`

The program correctly handles these test cases, and the logic appears to be sound. It efficiently checks all possible rotations of the array by leveraging the concatenated version of the array.

#### Annotations:

The annotations provide a good overview of the program's state and behavior. They correctly describe the state of the program before and after key operations, such as the concatenation of the array and the checking of windows.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations. The annotations support the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
