The given code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, then assigns it to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` will now hold the integer value provided by the user. The initial state mentioned other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `b`) which are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^5; `a` is the integer value provided by the user input; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
