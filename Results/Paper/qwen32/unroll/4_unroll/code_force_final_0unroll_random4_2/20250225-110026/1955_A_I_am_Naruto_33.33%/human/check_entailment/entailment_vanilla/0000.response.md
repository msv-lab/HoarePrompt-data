Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the minimum amount of burles Maxim needs to spend to buy `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion).

2. **Calculation of Minimum Cost**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is the cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining yogurt (if `n` is odd) is bought individually. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints the cost of one yogurt, which is `a`.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - Minimum cost is `9`, which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
  - Minimum cost is `14`, which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
  - Minimum cost is `15`, which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
  - Minimum cost is `20`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
