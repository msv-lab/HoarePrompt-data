Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to ensure its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. The price of one yogurt is `a` burles, and the price for two yogurts is `b` burles. The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost using the following logic:
- If `n > 1`:
  - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
  - `ans2` is the cost if the yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible, with any remaining yogurt bought individually: `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
  - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n == 1`:
  - The cost is simply `a`.

### Function Summary Recap
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints the minimum cost, which is either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, depending on the value of `n`.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment states that the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case by considering both scenarios (buying individually and buying in pairs) and handling the case where `n` is odd.

### Verification with Examples
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - Minimum cost: `min(10, 9) = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
     - Minimum cost: `min(15, 14) = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
     - Minimum cost: `min(15, 16) = 15`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
     - Minimum cost: `min(20, 22) = 20`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case by considering both scenarios and handling the case where `n` is odd. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
