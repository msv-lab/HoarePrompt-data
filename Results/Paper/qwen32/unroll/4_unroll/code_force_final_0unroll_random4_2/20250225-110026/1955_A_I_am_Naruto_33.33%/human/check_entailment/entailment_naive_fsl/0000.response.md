Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. Specifically, the issue lies in the calculation of `ans2`, which is intended to represent the cost when buying yogurts in pairs and possibly one additional yogurt individually.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
```
This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the number of pairs and the potential single yogurt. For example, if `n` is odd, the formula will always add the price of one yogurt (`a`) even if it would be cheaper to buy an additional pair.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Expected Output: `15` (Buy two yogurts for 11 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles)
- Actual Output from the program: `16` (Incorrectly calculates as `11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2` which equals `16`)

The correct approach would be to calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt separately:
```python
pairs = n // 2
remaining = n % 2
ans2 = pairs * b + remaining * a
```

Thus, the program is incorrect for cases where buying an additional yogurt individually is more expensive than buying another pair.
