Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective:**
   - Maxim wants to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
   - The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The price of two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
   - The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

2. **Approach:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - Calculate the cost if Maxim buys all yogurts individually: `ans1 = a * n`.
     - Calculate the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt(s) individually: `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
     - The result is the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a` since there is no promotion benefit for a single yogurt.

### Program Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the case when `n > 1` by calculating both `ans1` and `ans2` and then printing the minimum of the two.
- The program correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by printing `a`.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
     - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
     - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
     - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case as per the problem description.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
