### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules.

Here's a breakdown of the logic implemented in the function:

1. **Single Yogurt Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - If `n == 1`, the cost is simply `a` burles because there's no discount available for a single yogurt.
   - This is correctly handled by the `else` clause in the code where it prints `a`.

2. **Multiple Yogurts Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The cost can be computed in two ways:
     - **Option 1**: Buy all yogurts individually at the regular price, which is `a * n` burles.
     - **Option 2**: Buy pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and any remaining yogurt at the regular price. This can be computed as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
       - `b * (n // 2)`: This term calculates the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
       - `a * (n % 2)`: This term calculates the cost of the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.
   - The function computes both options and prints the minimum of the two costs.

### Validation Against Example:
Let's validate the function against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Option 1: `5 * 2 = 10`
  - Option 2: `9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - Minimum cost: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Option 1: `5 * 3 = 15`
  - Option 2: `9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
  - Minimum cost: `14` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Option 1: `5 * 3 = 15`
  - Option 2: `11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
  - Minimum cost: `15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Option 1: `5 * 4 = 20`
  - Option 2: `11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `20` (Correct)

The function correctly computes the minimum cost for each of the test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
