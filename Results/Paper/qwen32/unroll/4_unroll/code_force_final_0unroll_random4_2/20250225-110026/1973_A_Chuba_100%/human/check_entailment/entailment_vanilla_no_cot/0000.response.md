To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players playing chess, according to the problem description.

Let's analyze the logic and the implementation step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Sum of Scores**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program outputs `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (each game awards either 2 points in total or 2 points split as 1+1 in the case of a draw).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
     \]
   - The rationale behind this formula is to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the scores are possible given the game rules.

Let's examine if this formula correctly computes the maximum number of draws:

- **Case Analysis**:
  - **No Games Played**: When `p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`, the sum is `0`, which is even. The formula evaluates to `0`, correctly indicating no draws.
  - **One Draw**: When `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 1`, the sum is `2`, which is even. The formula evaluates to `1`, correctly indicating one draw.
  - **Impossible Scores**: When `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 1`, the sum is `3`, which is odd. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
  - **More Complex Cases**: For more complex cases, the formula should ensure that the scores are consistent with possible game outcomes. For example, when `p1 = 3`, `p2 = 4`, `p3 = 5`, the sum is `12`, which is even. The formula correctly evaluates to `6`.

Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify impossible score distributions.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
