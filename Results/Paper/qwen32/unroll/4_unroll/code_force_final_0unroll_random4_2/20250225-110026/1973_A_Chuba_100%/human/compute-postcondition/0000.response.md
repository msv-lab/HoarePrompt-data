The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state describes the properties of the test cases but does not specify the value of `t`.

After executing the code, `t` will hold the integer value provided by the input, and no other variables will be affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**
