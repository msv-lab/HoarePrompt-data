### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum of Scores and Parity**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it outputs `-1`. This is because the total points distributed in any set of games must be even (since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed, either 2 to the winner, 1 to each in case of a draw).
   
2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula aims to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the scores can be achieved through a valid series of games.

#### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**: `(0, 0, 0)`
  - Sum is `0`, which is even. The formula gives `0` draws, which is correct.
  
- **Example 2**: `(0, 1, 1)`
  - Sum is `2`, which is even. The formula gives `1` draw, which is correct.
  
- **Example 3**: `(1, 1, 1)`
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
  
- **Example 4**: `(1, 1, 2)`
  - Sum is `4`, which is even. The formula gives `2` draws, which is correct.
  
- **Example 5**: `(3, 3, 3)`
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
  
- **Example 6**: `(3, 4, 5)`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even. The formula gives `6` draws, which is correct.
  
- **Example 7**: `(1, 1, 10)`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even. The formula gives `2` draws, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the parity check and the calculation of the maximum number of draws for each test case. It produces the expected output for all provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
