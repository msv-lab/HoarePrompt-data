Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the given program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The key points are:
1. **Total Points Even**: The sum of the scores must be even because each game contributes exactly 2 points (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).
2. **Score Constraints**: The scores are given in non-decreasing order \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
3. **Maximizing Draws**: We need to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have occurred, given the scores.

### Code Analysis
The provided code processes each test case as follows:
1. **Input Handling**: Reads the number of test cases and the scores for each test case.
2. **Feasibility Check**: Checks if the total points (sum of the scores) are even. If not, it outputs `-1` because an odd total indicates an impossible score distribution.
3. **Draws Calculation**: If the total points are even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
   \]

### Function Summary
The function summary states that:
- The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores.
- It checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`.
- Otherwise, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the formula provided.

### Verification with Examples
Let's verify the correctness of the formula using the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points = 0 (even)
   - Draws = \(\frac{(0 + 0 + 0 - \max(0, 0 - 0 - 0))}{2} = 0\)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points = 2 (even)
   - Draws = \(\frac{(0 + 1 + 1 - \max(0, 1 - 0 - 1))}{2} = 1\)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points = 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points = 4 (even)
   - Draws = \(\frac{(1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1))}{2} = 2\)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points = 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points = 12 (even)
   - Draws = \(\frac{(3 + 4 + 5 - \max(0, 5 - 3 - 4))}{2} = 6\)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points = 12 (even)
   - Draws = \(\frac{(1 + 1 + 10 - \max(0, 10 - 1 - 1))}{2} = 2\)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly checks for the feasibility of the scores (total points must be even) and calculates the maximum number of draws using a valid formula that respects the constraints of the problem. The code produces the correct output for all the provided examples, which supports the correctness of the implementation.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
