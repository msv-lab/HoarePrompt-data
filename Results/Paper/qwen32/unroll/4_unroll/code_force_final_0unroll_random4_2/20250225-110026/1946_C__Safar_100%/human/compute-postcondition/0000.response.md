The code snippet creates an adjacency list `g` for a graph with `n+1` vertices, initialized with empty lists. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `edges` is still a list of tuples representing the edges in the tree.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, and `g` is a list of `n+1` empty lists.**
