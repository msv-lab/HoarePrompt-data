To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `l <= r`. Given the initial state:

- `l` is 1
- `r` is `n // k`

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` is already 1, we need to ensure that `r` is at least 1. Given that `r` is calculated as `n // k`, and knowing that `1 <= k < n`, `r` should naturally be at least 1. However, to explicitly state the requirement:

1. `n // k` must be at least 1.
2. Since `k < n`, `n // k` will always be at least 1 (assuming integer division).

Given this, no specific adjustment is needed for `n` or `k` as long as they satisfy the initial conditions `1 <= k < n`. Therefore, the state remains as provided, and the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge in the tree, `c` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n // k`**
