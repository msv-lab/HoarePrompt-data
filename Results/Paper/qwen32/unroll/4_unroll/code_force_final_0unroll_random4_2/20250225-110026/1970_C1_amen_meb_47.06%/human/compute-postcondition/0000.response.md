The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list named `numbers`. No other variables are modified, and no input or output operations are performed. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the initial node where the stone is placed. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `numbers` is an empty list.**
