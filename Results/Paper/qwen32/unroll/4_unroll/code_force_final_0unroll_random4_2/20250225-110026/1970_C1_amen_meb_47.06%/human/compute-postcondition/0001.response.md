In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no modifications to the program state are necessary to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the initial node where the stone is placed. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `numbers` is an empty list.**
