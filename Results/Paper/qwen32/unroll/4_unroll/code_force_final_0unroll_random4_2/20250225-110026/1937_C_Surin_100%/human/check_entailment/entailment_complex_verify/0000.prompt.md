You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interact with the interactor by making queries in the form "? a b c d" (where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) and receiving a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The function must find a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized and print "! i j" for each test case. The total number of queries across all test cases must not exceed 3n, where n is the sum of lengths of all permutations.

    #State: The loop finds and prints the two largest unique elements in the list of integers provided by the input. The variable `prev` holds the value of the second largest element, and `v1` holds the value of the largest element. All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v2`, `r`, `r2`) are not guaranteed to retain specific values after the loop completes as they are used for intermediate calculations and comparisons. The lambda function `R` remains unchanged and is still a function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it interacts with an interactor to determine a pair of indices (i, j) that maximizes the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices, and then prints "! i j". The function ensures that the total number of queries made across all test cases does not exceed 3n, where n is the sum of the lengths of all permutations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized using a strategy based on bitwise OR operations. However, there are several issues and edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Incorrect Query Strategy**: The program uses a strategy that is not guaranteed to find the maximum XOR value. The approach is based on finding the maximum OR value, which does not directly translate to finding the maximum XOR value. The XOR operation has different properties and does not necessarily align with the OR operation in terms of maximizing the result.

2. **Potential Infinite Loop**: The program uses a loop that is supposed to find the maximum OR value but does not handle all edge cases. Specifically, the loop might not terminate correctly or might not correctly identify the indices that maximize the OR value.

3. **Handling of Equal OR Values**: The program does not handle the case where the OR values are equal correctly. It makes an additional query to compare the indices, but this might not always lead to the correct identification of the indices that maximize the XOR value.

4. **Lack of Verification**: The program does not verify that the found indices actually maximize the XOR value. It simply outputs the indices based on the OR comparisons, which might not be correct.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as very small values of `n` or specific permutations of `p` that might require a different strategy to find the maximum XOR value.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to be redesigned to directly maximize the XOR value using a strategy that correctly handles all possible permutations and edge cases. The current approach is flawed and does not guarantee the correct result for all inputs.

Here is a potential counterexample where the program might fail:

- **Input**: `n = 4`, `p = [0, 3, 1, 2]`
- **Expected Output**: `! 3 2` or `! 2 3` (since `3 ⊕ 2 = 1 ⊕ 0 = 3` is the maximum XOR value)
- **Program Output**: The program might output incorrect indices due to the incorrect query strategy.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
