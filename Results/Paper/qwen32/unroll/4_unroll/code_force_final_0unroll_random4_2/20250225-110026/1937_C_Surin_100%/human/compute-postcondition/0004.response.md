Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, the function can query the interactor to compare bitwise OR operations between pairs of elements in the permutation. The function's goal is to determine a pair of indices (i, j) that maximizes the bitwise XOR operation between the elements at those indices and print "! i j" for each test case. The total number of queries across all test cases must not exceed 3n, where n is the sum of lengths of all permutations.**
