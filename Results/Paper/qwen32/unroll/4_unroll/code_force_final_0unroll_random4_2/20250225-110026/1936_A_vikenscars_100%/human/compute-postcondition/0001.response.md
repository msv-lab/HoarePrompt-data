To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the secret permutation `p`, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`.
- `max_item_idx` is 0.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop can execute if the range `(1, n)` has at least one element. This is true as long as `n` is greater than 1. Since the problem states `2 <= n <= 10^4`, `n` is guaranteed to be greater than 1, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

The variable `max_item_idx` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. However, it is part of the state, and its value is given as 0, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment to ensure the loop can execute. The state remains as given.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the secret permutation `p`, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`; `max_item_idx` is 0**.
