Given the initial state:
- `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p`.
- `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:
```python
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```

Let's break down the values:
1. `max_item_idx`: This is the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p`. Since the exact permutation `p` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `max_item_idx`. However, we know that it represents the index of the maximum element in the list `p`.
2. `pair_idx`: This is explicitly stated to be equal to `max_item_idx`. Therefore, `pair_idx` will have the same value as `max_item_idx`.

Since we don't have the specific permutation `p`, we can't provide the exact numerical values for `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx] (where max_item_idx is the index of the maximum element in the permutation p and pair_idx is equal to max_item_idx)**
