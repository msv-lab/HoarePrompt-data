Output State: **max_item_idx is the index of the maximum element in the permutation p; pair_idx is equal to max_item_idx.**

This means that the variable `pair_idx` has been assigned the same value as `max_item_idx`, which is the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
