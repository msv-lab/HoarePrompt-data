You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2

    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers input during the loop's execution, and `i` will be equal to `n`. The initial value of `t` and any other variables not affected by the loop will remain unchanged. The program will have printed 'YES', 'NO', or a combination of both based on the conditions evaluated for each pair of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'YES' if the conditions `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` and `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` are not met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints output based on the input conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides and then form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
1. **Cut Parallel to one side**: If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to one of its sides, he can either cut it into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) and \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( b \) is even) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) and \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) (if \( a \) is even).
2. **Form a New Rectangle**: From the two smaller rectangles, Bob can try to form a new rectangle. The only way Bob cannot form a new rectangle is if the resulting two smaller rectangles are \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) and \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( a = 1 \)) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \) and \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \) (if \( b = 1 \)), which can only form the same rectangle (rotated or not).

### Key Observations:
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because he cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
- If \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and form a new rectangle unless the resulting smaller rectangles are \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \).

### Program Analysis:
The program checks the following conditions:
1. **If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd**: It prints "NO" because Bob cannot form a new rectangle.
2. **If \( a / 2 = b \) or \( b / 2 = a \)**: This condition seems incorrect. The program checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, but this is not the only condition under which Bob cannot form a new rectangle. For example, if \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 3 \), Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( 3 \times 3 \) rectangles and form a \( 3 \times 6 \) rectangle, which is different from the original \( 6 \times 3 \) rectangle.
3. **Otherwise**: It prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. It should not be checking if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
- The program should only check if both dimensions are odd to print "NO". If either dimension is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

### Correct Program:
The correct program should only check if both dimensions are odd. If they are, print "NO". Otherwise, print "YES".

### Correctness:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`.

Correctness: **False**
