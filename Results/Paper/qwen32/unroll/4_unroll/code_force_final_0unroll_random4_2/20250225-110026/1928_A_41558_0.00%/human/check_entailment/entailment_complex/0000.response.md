### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

**Problem Understanding:**
- We need to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle (not considering rotations as different).
- For a rectangle to be reassembled into a different rectangle, the dimensions of the new rectangle must be different from \(a \times b\).

**Key Observations:**
1. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it's impossible to form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-sized side would always result in at least one dimension being odd, and the only possible reassembly would result in the same dimensions.
2. If one dimension is exactly twice the other (i.e., \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\)), it's also impossible to form a new rectangle because the only possible reassembly would result in the same dimensions.
3. In all other cases, it's possible to form a new rectangle by cutting and reassembling.

**Analysis of the Provided Solution:**
- The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints 'NO'.
- It then checks if one dimension is exactly twice the other (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`). If true, it prints 'NO'.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES'.

**Problems with the Provided Solution:**
- The condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is incorrect for checking if one dimension is exactly twice the other. This condition uses floating-point division, which can lead to precision issues and incorrect results due to floating-point arithmetic. Instead, integer division should be used (`a // 2 == b or b // 2 == a`).
- The logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed is correct based on the observations, but the implementation needs to be corrected to avoid floating-point issues.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with floating-point division, the provided program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: **False**
