Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides and then form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
1. **Cut Parallel to one side**: If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to one of its sides, he can either cut it into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) and \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( b \) is even) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) and \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) (if \( a \) is even).
2. **Form a New Rectangle**: From the two smaller rectangles, Bob can try to form a new rectangle. The only way Bob cannot form a new rectangle is if the resulting two smaller rectangles are \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) and \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( a = 1 \)) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \) and \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \) (if \( b = 1 \)), which can only form the same rectangle (rotated or not).

### Key Observations:
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because he cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
- If \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and form a new rectangle unless the resulting smaller rectangles are \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \).

### Program Analysis:
The program checks the following conditions:
1. **If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd**: It prints "NO" because Bob cannot form a new rectangle.
2. **If \( a / 2 = b \) or \( b / 2 = a \)**: This condition seems incorrect. The program checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, but this is not the only condition under which Bob cannot form a new rectangle. For example, if \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 3 \), Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( 3 \times 3 \) rectangles and form a \( 3 \times 6 \) rectangle, which is different from the original \( 6 \times 3 \) rectangle.
3. **Otherwise**: It prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. It should not be checking if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
- The program should only check if both dimensions are odd to print "NO". If either dimension is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

### Correct Program:
The correct program should only check if both dimensions are odd. If they are, print "NO". Otherwise, print "YES".

### Correctness:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`.

Correctness: **False**
