To determine whether the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is satisfied right before the loop starts.

Given:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is 0.

The loop condition is `i <= m and i * i <= n + i`.

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `i <= m`: Since `i` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer, this condition is always true as long as `m` is at least 1, which it is.
2. `i * i <= n + i`: Substituting `i = 1` into the inequality, we get `1 * 1 <= n + 1`, which simplifies to `1 <= n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n + 1` will always be at least 2, so `1 <= n + 1` is always true.

Since both parts of the condition are always true given the initial values and constraints, the loop can certainly execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary.

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1; `ans` is 0**
