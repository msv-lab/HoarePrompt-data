Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_7()`. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range remains valid.
