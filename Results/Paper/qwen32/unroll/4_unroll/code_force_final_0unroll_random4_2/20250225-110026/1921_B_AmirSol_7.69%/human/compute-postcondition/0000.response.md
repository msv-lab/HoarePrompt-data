Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `counter` has been initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
