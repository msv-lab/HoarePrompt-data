The function `func` accepts three integer parameters for each test case: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). There are `t` such test cases. The function calculates and returns the total cost of the buns based on the given prices. Specifically:
- Case_1: If `b` is less than `a`, the function calculates the total cost as `b` for the first bun and `a` for the remaining `n-1` buns.
- Case_2: If `b` is not less than `a`, the function calculates the total cost as `a` for all `n` buns.
Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` for each of `t` test cases, and returns the total cost of `n` buns, where the first bun is sold at price `b` if `b` is less than `a`, otherwise all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.**
