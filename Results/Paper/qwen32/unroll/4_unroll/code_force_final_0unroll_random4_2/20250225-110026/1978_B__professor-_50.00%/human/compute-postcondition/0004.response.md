Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of `n` buns, considering that the first bun can be sold at a modified price `b` if `b` is less than the usual price `a`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The function handles different scenarios based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b` to determine the optimal total cost.**
