The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are specified for each test case. Since the code only reads the number of test cases and does not modify `n`, `a`, or `b`, the output state will reflect that `t` has been assigned a value, while `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial descriptions.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the number of buns, `a` is the usual price of a bun, and `b` is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.**
