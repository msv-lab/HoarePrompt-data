You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of non-negative integers. The length of elements is at least the maximum of removals and negatives.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers, the length of `elements` is at least the maximum of `removals` and `negatives`, `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements, `s` is the sum of the first `len(elements) - removals` elements of `elements`, `s2` is adjusted as described above.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of non-negative integers with a length at least as large as the maximum of `removals` and `negatives`. The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
