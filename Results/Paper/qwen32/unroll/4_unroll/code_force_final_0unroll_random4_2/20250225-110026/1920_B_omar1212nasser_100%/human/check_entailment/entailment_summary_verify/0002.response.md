### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the program, let's carefully analyze the logic and behavior of `func_2` in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice removes up to `k` elements to maximize the sum.
- Bob negates up to `x` elements to minimize the sum.
- The goal is to find the optimal sum after both moves.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:

1. **Sorting**: The array `elements` is sorted. This allows easy selection of the largest elements for negation.
2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: `s` is the sum of all elements in the array.
3. **Negation Sum Calculation**: `s2` is the sum of the `negatives` largest elements. This is used to compute the sum after Bob negates these elements.
4. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove (`i` from 0 to `removals`).
   - For each `i`, it updates `s` by subtracting the `i` largest elements (since Alice removes them).
   - It also updates `s2` by adjusting for the new set of elements Bob can negate. Specifically, it subtracts the `i` largest elements removed by Alice and adds the next largest element that Bob can negate.
   - The sum after Alice's and Bob's moves is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`. This is because negating an element effectively subtracts twice its value from the sum (once for its removal and once for its negation).
   - These sums are stored in the list `pos`.
5. **Maximization**: The function returns the maximum value in `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after both players' moves.

#### Verification:

- **Correctness of the Iterative Calculation**:
  - When `i = 0`, Alice removes no elements, and Bob negates the `negatives` largest elements.
  - As `i` increases, Alice removes more elements, and Bob can negate more elements, including the newly exposed smaller elements.
  - The formula `s - 2 * s2` correctly accounts for the sum after both moves.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - When `k = 0`, Alice removes no elements, and the function correctly computes the sum after Bob's moves.
  - When `x = 0`, Bob negates no elements, and the function correctly computes the sum after Alice's moves.
  - When `k = n` or `x = n`, Alice or Bob can remove or negate all elements, and the function correctly computes the resulting sum.

- **Example Verification**:
  - **First Test Case**: `n = 1, k = 1, x = 1, a = [1]`. Alice removes the element, resulting in a sum of `0`.
  - **Second Test Case**: `n = 4, k = 1, x = 1, a = [3, 1, 2, 4]`. Alice removes no elements, and Bob negates `4`, resulting in a sum of `2`.
  - **Fifth Test Case**: `n = 6, k = 6, x = 3, a = [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6]`. Alice removes all elements, resulting in a sum of `0`.
  - **Sixth Test Case**: `n = 6, k = 6, x = 1, a = [3, 7, 3, 3, 32, 15]`. Alice removes all elements, resulting in a sum of `0`.
  - **Seventh Test Case**: `n = 8, k = 5, x = 3, a = [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 9, 9]`. Alice removes `5` elements, and Bob negates `3` elements, resulting in a sum of `-5`.
  - **Eighth Test Case**: `n = 10, k = 6, x = 4, a = [1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 200]`. Alice removes `6` elements, and Bob negates `4` elements, resulting in a sum of `-9`.
  - **Ninth Test Case**: `n = 2, k = 2, x = 1, a = [4, 3]`. Alice removes both elements, resulting in a sum of `0`.
  - **Tenth Test Case**: `n = 1, k = 3, x = 1, a = [1]`. Alice removes the element, resulting in a sum of `0`.

All these examples align with the expected outcomes, indicating that the function correctly handles the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints. It considers all possible optimal moves for both Alice and Bob and returns the correct final sum for each test case.
