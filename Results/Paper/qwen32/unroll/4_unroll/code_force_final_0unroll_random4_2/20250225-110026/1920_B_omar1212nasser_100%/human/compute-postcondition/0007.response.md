Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of non-negative integers with a length at least as large as the maximum of `removals` and `negatives`. The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements.**
