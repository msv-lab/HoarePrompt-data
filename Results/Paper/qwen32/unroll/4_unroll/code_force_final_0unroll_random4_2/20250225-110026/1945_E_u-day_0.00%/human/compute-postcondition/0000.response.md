To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_1()` returns. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can assume it returns two values that will be assigned to `n` and `k`. We will denote these returned values as `n_new` and `k_new`.

Given that `n` and `k` are being reassigned, their new values will be whatever `func_1()` returns. The variable `arr` is not affected by this code snippet, so it retains its initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `n_new`, `k` is `k_new`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n` (unchanged)**.

In natural language: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, while `arr` remains unchanged as a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`.
