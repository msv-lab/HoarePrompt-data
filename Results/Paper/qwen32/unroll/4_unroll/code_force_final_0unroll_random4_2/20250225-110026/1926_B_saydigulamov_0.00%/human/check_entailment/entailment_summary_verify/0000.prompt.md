You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it counts the number of '1's in each row and checks if the first two counts are equal. If they are, it prints the list of counts. The function does not explicitly return a value but prints the counts for test cases where the first two counts of '1's in the rows are equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Shape Detection**:
   - The program only counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in the list `k`.
   - It then checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal, and if so, it prints the list `k`. This logic does not correctly identify the shape of the figure based on the given problem description.

2. **Output Mismatch**:
   - The program is supposed to output either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape of the '1's in the grid.
   - Instead, it prints the list `k` if the first two counts are equal, which is not the expected output.

3. **Missing Shape Detection Logic**:
   - The program does not implement any logic to check for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square.
   - It does not check for the conditions that the number of '1's in each row should be `2*i - 1` for a triangle or `k` for a square, where `i` is the row index and `k` is the side length of the square.

4. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     3
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     - The program should output "SQUARE" because the '1's form a 2x2 square.
     - However, the program will output `[2, 2]` because it only checks if the first two counts are equal and prints the counts.

5. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle or a square positioned in different parts of the grid.

Given these issues, the program is clearly incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
