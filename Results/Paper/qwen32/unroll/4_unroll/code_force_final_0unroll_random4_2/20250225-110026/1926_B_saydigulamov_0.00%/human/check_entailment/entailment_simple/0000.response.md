Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape on the grid is a triangle or a square. The program reads the input, counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1', and checks if the first two counts are equal. This approach is insufficient to distinguish between a square and a triangle.

For a square, the number of '1's in each row is the same (equal to the size of the square, \( k \)). For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row increases (or decreases) by 2, starting from 1 and reaching \( 2k-1 \) (for an upward-pointing triangle) or starting from \( 2k-1 \) and reaching 1 (for a downward-pointing triangle).

The given program does not implement any logic to check for these specific patterns. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the shape. For example, it would incorrectly identify a triangle where the first two rows have the same number of '1's as a square.

Correctness: **False**
