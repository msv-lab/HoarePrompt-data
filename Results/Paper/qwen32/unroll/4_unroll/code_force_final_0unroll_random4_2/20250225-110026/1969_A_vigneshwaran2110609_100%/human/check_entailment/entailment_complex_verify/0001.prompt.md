You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break

            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. The output consists of `n` lines, each containing either `2` or `3`, based on the condition inside the inner loop for each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it determines if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`. The function does not modify the input values and produces `n` lines of output, each corresponding to a test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it solves the problem correctly.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least two friends come to the party. A friend will attend the party only if they and their best friend both receive invitations.

### Program Analysis
The given program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program then iterates through each friend `i` (from 0 to `x-1`).
   - It checks if the best friend of the `i-th` friend is the `i-th` friend itself (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`). This condition is checking if there is a mutual best friend relationship.
   - If such a mutual best friend relationship is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that only two invitations are needed.

3. **Handling the Case Without Mutual Best Friends:**
   - If no mutual best friend relationship is found for any friend, the program prints `3`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Invitations:**
  - The program assumes that if there is a mutual best friend relationship, only two invitations are needed. This is not always true.
  - If there are no mutual best friend relationships, the program always prints `3`. However, this is not always the minimum number of invitations needed.

- **Example Analysis:**
  - **First Test Case:** `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
    - No mutual best friend relationships.
    - The program prints `3`, which is correct.
  - **Second Test Case:** `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
    - No mutual best friend relationships.
    - The program prints `3`, which is correct.
  - **Third Test Case:** `p = [2, 1]`
    - Mutual best friend relationships exist (friend 1 and friend 2).
    - The program prints `2`, which is correct.
  - However, consider a case like `p = [4, 3, 2, 1]` for `n=4`:
    - No mutual best friend relationships.
    - The program prints `3`.
    - But actually, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4), and both pairs will come, requiring only `2` invitations.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations in all cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle cases where no mutual best friend relationships exist but fewer than three invitations are still sufficient.
