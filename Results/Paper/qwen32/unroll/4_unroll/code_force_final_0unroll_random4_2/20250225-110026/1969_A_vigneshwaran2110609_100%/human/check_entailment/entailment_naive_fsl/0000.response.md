Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it does not work as expected.

The program iterates through each friend and checks if the best friend of the current friend is the current friend's best friend (i.e., if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2`, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible configurations of friendships and might miss cases where fewer than 3 invitations are needed to bring at least 2 friends to the party.

Let's consider a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- Friend 1's best friend is Friend 2.
- Friend 2's best friend is Friend 3.
- Friend 3's best friend is Friend 4.
- Friend 4's best friend is Friend 1.

In this configuration, Monocarp can invite Friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party because:
- Friend 1 will come because Friend 2 is invited, and Friend 2's best friend is Friend 1.
- Friend 2 will come because Friend 1 is invited, and Friend 1's best friend is Friend 2.

However, the provided program will print `3` for this input because it does not find any pair where `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` (which would be the case if each friend's best friend was themselves, which is not possible given the problem constraints).

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible configurations of friendships correctly.
