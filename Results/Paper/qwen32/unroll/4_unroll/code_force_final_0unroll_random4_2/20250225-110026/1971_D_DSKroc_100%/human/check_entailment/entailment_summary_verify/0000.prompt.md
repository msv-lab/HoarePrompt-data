You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`. If the string is non-decreasing (i.e., no '1' is preceded by a '0'), it increments the count by 1. The function outputs `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
```

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).

### Analysis:
1. **Counting Transitions:**
   - The program counts transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0' using the variable `count`.
   - Each transition indicates a potential point where the string needs to be cut to separate '0's and '1's.

2. **Handling Already Sorted Strings:**
   - The variable `flag` checks if there is at least one '0' followed by a '1'. If not, the string is already sorted or consists of all '0's or all '1's.
   - If `flag` is `0` (no '0' followed by '1'), the program outputs `count + 1`. This accounts for the case where the string is already sorted or consists of all '0's or all '1's.
   - If `flag` is `1` (there is at least one '0' followed by '1'), the program outputs `count`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some edge cases to ensure correctness.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0` → `count = 3`
   - There is a '0' followed by a '1' → `flag = 1`
   - Output: `count = 3` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - No transitions → `count = 0`
   - No '0' followed by '1' → `flag = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1`
   - No transitions → `count = 0`
   - No '0' followed by '1' → `flag = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transition: `1->0` → `count = 1`
   - No '0' followed by '1' → `flag = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 2` (Correct)

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - Transition: `0->1` → `count = 1`
   - There is a '0' followed by a '1' → `flag = 1`
   - Output: `count = 1` (Correct)

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0` → `count = 2`
   - There is a '0' followed by a '1' → `flag = 1`
   - Output: `count = 2` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
1. **Input:** `0`
   - No transitions → `count = 0`
   - No '0' followed by '1' → `flag = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `1111`
   - No transitions → `count = 0`
   - No '0' followed by '1' → `flag = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `0000`
   - No transitions → `count = 0`
   - No '0' followed by '1' → `flag = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After testing the program with the provided examples and edge cases, it seems to meet the requirements of the problem description. The program correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.

### Final Answer:
