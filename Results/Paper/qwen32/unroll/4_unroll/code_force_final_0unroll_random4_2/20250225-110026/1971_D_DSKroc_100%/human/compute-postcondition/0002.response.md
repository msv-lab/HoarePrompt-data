Output State: **The output state consists of `t` number of lines, each representing the count of transitions between '0' and '1' in the respective input string `s`. If the string is non-decreasing (i.e., no '1' is preceded by a '0'), the count is incremented by 1. Variables `t`, `s`, `count`, and `flag` do not retain their values after the loop; `t` remains the initial integer input, and `s` is the last input string processed.**
