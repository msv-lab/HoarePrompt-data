You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` number of lines, each representing the count of transitions between '0' and '1' in the respective input string `s`. If the string is non-decreasing (i.e., no '1' is preceded by a '0'), the count is incremented by 1. Variables `t`, `s`, `count`, and `flag` do not retain their values after the loop; `t` remains the initial integer input, and `s` is the last input string processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a string `s` for each of the `t` test cases. The string `s` consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the content of the string `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
