To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used to solve the problem and compare it with the requirements given in the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.
   - The key is in understanding how XOR works and how to manipulate the sequence to make the XOR zero.

3. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of any number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

4. **Strategy for Bob to Win**:
   - For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers should be 0.
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that the count of each number type (1, 2, 3, 4) is even because XOR of even occurrences of the same number is 0.

5. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence allows Bob to win as many times as possible.
   - This means Eve should aim to leave an even count of each number type as often as possible.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- It then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Bob's wins} = \left(\frac{a}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{c}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{d}{2}\right) + \left(\text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\right)
  \]
- Here, \(\left(\frac{a}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{c}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)\) counts how many pairs of each number can be removed, allowing Bob to win if the remaining numbers have an even count.
- The additional term \(\left(\text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\right)\) checks if there is one of each odd-count number (1, 2, 3) left. If so, removing one of these will leave an even count for all, allowing Bob to win one more time.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**: Input `1 1 1 0`
  - Calculation: \(1//2 + 1//2 + 1//2 + 0//2 + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
  - Output: `1` (Correct)
- **Example 2**: Input `1 0 1 2`
  - Calculation: \(1//2 + 0//2 + 1//2 + 2//2 + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 0 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1\)
  - Output: `1` (Correct)
- **Example 3**: Input `2 2 2 0`
  - Calculation: \(2//2 + 2//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + \text{int}(2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\)
  - Output: `3` (Correct)
- **Example 4**: Input `3 3 2 0`
  - Calculation: \(3//2 + 3//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + \text{int}(3 \% 2 + 3 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4\)
  - Output: `3` (Correct, the int term should be 0 as 3 + 3 + 2 != 3)
- **Example 5**: Input `0 9 9 9`
  - Calculation: \(0//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + \text{int}(0 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13\)
  - Output: `12` (Correct, the int term should be 0 as 0 + 1 + 1 != 3)

### Conclusion:
The program logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases as expected. The formula accurately calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **True**
