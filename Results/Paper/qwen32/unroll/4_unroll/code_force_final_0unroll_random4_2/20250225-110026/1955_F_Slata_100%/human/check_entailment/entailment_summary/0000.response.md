### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the rules of the game and the optimal strategy of Eve. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero. Eve removes one number at a time to maximize Bob's wins.

To understand the solution, let's analyze the XOR operation:
- XOR of a number with itself is 0 (e.g., 1 XOR 1 = 0).
- XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., 1 XOR 0 = 1).
- XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.

The key observation is that Bob wins if the sequence can be partitioned into pairs such that each pair XORs to zero. If there are an odd number of ones, threes, or any other number that doesn't pair perfectly, the final XOR will be non-zero, and Alice wins.

The provided program calculates the maximum number of pairs for each type of number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s) and adds an additional win for Bob if there are exactly three numbers left that cannot be paired (which would XOR to zero).

Let's break down the formula:
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs for each type of number.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there are exactly three odd counts (1s, 3s, or any other number). If so, it adds one more win for Bob because these three numbers can be arranged to XOR to zero.

The program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy of Eve to maximize Bob's wins by pairing numbers effectively.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the optimal strategy of Eve.
