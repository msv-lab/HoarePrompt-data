The code snippet `times = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `times`. This input represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was initially described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
