You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        dic = dict()
        ans = 0
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if i in dic:
                dic[i] -= 1
                if dic[i] == 0:
                    del dic[i]
            else:
                if s not in dic:
                    dic[s] = 0
                dic[s] += 1
                ans += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of unique integers that can be obtained by either taking an integer from the list or its bitwise XOR with `2^31 - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of groups needed based on the problem description. Specifically, the use of XOR operation with `check` (which is `2**31 - 1`) does not align with the problem's requirements. The program seems to be trying to count unique patterns of bits but does so incorrectly.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of XOR**: The program uses `i ^ check` where `check` is `2**31 - 1` (all 1s in a 32-bit integer). This operation inverts the bits of `i` but does not help in determining if two numbers have different bits in the 1st to 31st positions. Instead, it should be checking the actual bit patterns.

2. **Logic for Grouping**: The program uses a dictionary to keep track of numbers and their inverted counterparts, but this does not correctly handle the requirement that no two numbers in the same group can have matching bits in positions 1 to 31. The logic should ensure that for each bit position, no two numbers in the same group have the same value.

3. **Example of Failure**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   3
   1 2 3
   ```
   The binary representations are:
   - 1: `000...001`
   - 2: `000...010`
   - 3: `000...011`
   
   Here, 1 and 2 can be in the same group because they do not have matching bits. Similarly, 2 and 3 can be in the same group. However, 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group because they have a matching bit (the least significant bit). The correct answer should be 2 groups, but the program might not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
