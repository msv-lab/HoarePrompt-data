The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `times`. Therefore, the state of `times` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

For the loop to execute at least once, `times` must be greater than 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only its body, which is omitted in this case.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `check` is 2147483647**
