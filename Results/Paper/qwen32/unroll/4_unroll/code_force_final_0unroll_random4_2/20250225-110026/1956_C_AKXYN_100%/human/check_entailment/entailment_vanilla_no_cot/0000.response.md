Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix or the correct operations needed to achieve it. The logic for generating the matrix and the operations is flawed. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with rows filled with the sequence [1, 2, ..., n]. This does not maximize the sum of the matrix.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The maximum sum should be `n * (n * n + 1) / 2`, which is the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers.

3. **Operations**: The operations provided in the loop do not achieve the maximum sum. The operations should be designed to fill the matrix in such a way that each number from 1 to `n^2` appears exactly once.

To achieve the maximum sum, one possible approach is to fill the matrix in a way that each row and each column contains a permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. One such arrangement is to fill the matrix diagonally. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        num = 1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                mat[(i + j) % n][j] = num
                num += 1
        res = n * (n * n + 1) // 2
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2', i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This version of the program fills the matrix diagonally and then prints the operations to achieve this arrangement. The sum is correctly calculated as `n * (n * n + 1) / 2`, and the operations ensure that each row and column is filled with a permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`.
