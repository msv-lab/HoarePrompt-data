Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using a limited number of operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \). Set each element in the row \( i \) to the values in the permutation.
2. Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \). Set each element in the column \( i \) to the values in the permutation.

The objective is to find a sequence of operations (no more than \( 2n \)) that maximizes the sum of the matrix elements.

### Maximum Sum Calculation

The maximum possible sum of the matrix can be derived by assigning the largest possible values to the matrix elements. The optimal strategy is to fill the matrix with the values \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) in a way that maximizes the sum. A straightforward approach is to fill the matrix in such a way that each row and each column gets the numbers from 1 to \( n \) without repetition.

The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

However, since each row and each column can be independently filled with the numbers from 1 to \( n \), the maximum sum for the entire matrix is:
\[ \text{Max Sum} = n \times \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right) = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

### Strategy to Achieve Maximum Sum

To achieve the maximum sum, we can use the following strategy:
1. For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 1 operation with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
2. For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

This strategy ensures that each row and each column contains the numbers from 1 to \( n \), thus maximizing the sum of the matrix. The total number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program to see if it implements the correct strategy.

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This line initializes the matrix with the numbers from 1 to \( n \) in each row. However, this initialization is not used in the subsequent operations.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   This loop calculates the sum using a formula that does not correspond to the maximum sum derived above. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(res, n << 1)
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   The program prints the calculated sum and performs \( 2n \) operations as described. The operations are correct in terms of filling the matrix with the numbers from 1 to \( n \) in each row and each column.

### Conclusion

The program performs the correct operations to maximize the sum of the matrix, but it calculates the sum incorrectly. The correct sum should be \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

### Correctness

Given that the program performs the correct operations but calculates the sum incorrectly, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**
