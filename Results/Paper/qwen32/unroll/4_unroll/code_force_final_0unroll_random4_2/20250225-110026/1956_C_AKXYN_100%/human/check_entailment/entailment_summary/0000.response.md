### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Matrix Initialization and Sum Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an `n x n` matrix where each row is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - The sum `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This formula is derived from the sum of the maximum possible values that can be placed in the matrix with the given operations.

2. **Output Format:**
   - For each test case, the function outputs the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n * 2`.
   - It then prints `2 * n` lines, each describing an operation. The operations are of type 1 and type 2, affecting the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively.

3. **Operations:**
   - The operations are performed in a specific order: for each row `i` from `n` to 1, it performs a type 1 operation (modifying the row) and a type 2 operation (modifying the column).
   - This ensures that each row and column is assigned a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, thereby maximizing the sum of the matrix.

### Verification:

- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is used to calculate the sum. This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the highest possible values in the matrix. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n(n+1)/2`, and the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers is `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`. The formula used in the program is a simplified version derived from these properties.
  
- **Operations:**
  - The program performs exactly `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
  - Each operation assigns a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to a row or a column, ensuring that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the required operations to achieve that sum. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
