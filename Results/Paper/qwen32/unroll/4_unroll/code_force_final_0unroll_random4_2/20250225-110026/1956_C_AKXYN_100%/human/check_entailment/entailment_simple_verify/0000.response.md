Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine if the program is correct or not.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program generates a matrix where each row and each column is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\). It then calculates the sum of the matrix and prints the operations.

### Calculation of the Sum:
The program calculates the sum using the formula:
\[ \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \]

Let's verify this formula:
- For \( n = 1 \):
  \[ \text{res} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \]
  The matrix is \([1]\), sum = 1.

- For \( n = 2 \):
  \[ \text{res} = 1 \times 1 + 2 \times 3 = 1 + 6 = 7 \]
  The matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  1 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  Sum = 6, which is incorrect. The correct sum should be 8 with the matrix:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  1 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

### Operations:
The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, each filling a row or a column with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the maximum possible sum. The example provided (\( n = 2 \)) shows that the program produces a sum of 6 instead of the maximum possible sum of 8.

### Verification with Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the matrix is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) for each row and column. This approach does not maximize the sum because it does not utilize the full potential of permutations to maximize the matrix values.

### Conclusion:
The program does not maximize the sum of the matrix for all values of \( n \). The original assessment is correct in identifying this flaw.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
