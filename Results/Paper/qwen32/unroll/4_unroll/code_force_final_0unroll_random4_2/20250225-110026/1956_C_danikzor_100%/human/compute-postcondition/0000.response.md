Output State: **Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500) representing the size of the `n` × `n` matrix filled with zeroes. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500) and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases not exceeding 5 × 10^5. `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`.**

Natural language: The value of `n` is now the integer input read from the user, representing the size of the `n` × `n` matrix. All other conditions and constraints remain the same.
