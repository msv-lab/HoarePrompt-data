### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program. The objective is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using a specific set of operations, and the program should provide both the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the matrix.
2. **Operations**:
   - Type 1: Assign a row \( i \) with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - Type 2: Assign a column \( i \) with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
3. **Constraints**:
   - The sum of all the numbers in the matrix should be maximized.
   - The solution should be achieved using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum sum as \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) and outputs \( 2n \) operations, where each operation is either setting a row or a column to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).

#### Verification of Maximum Sum:
The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is indeed the sum of the first \( n^2 \) natural numbers, which is the maximum possible sum if we could place distinct numbers from 1 to \( n \) in each cell of the matrix. However, the operations provided do not ensure that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly once in each row and each column.

#### Verification of Operations:
The operations described in the program are:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), set the row \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).
- For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), set the column \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).

This approach does not guarantee that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly once in each row and each column. Instead, it fills each row and column with the same decreasing sequence, which does not yield the maximum possible sum.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each row and each column contains distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) in such a way that the sum is maximized. One correct approach is to fill the matrix in a way that each row and each column contains the integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once. For example, for \( n = 2 \), a correct matrix would be:
```
1 2
2 1
```
However, this matrix does not achieve the maximum sum of 7 for \( n = 2 \). The correct matrix for \( n = 2 \) is:
```
1 2
2 3
```
This matrix has a sum of \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 \), which is incorrect for \( n = 2 \). The correct sum for \( n = 2 \) is 7, achieved by the following matrix:
```
1 2
2 3
```
However, the program does not generate such a matrix. Instead, it fills the matrix with the same decreasing sequence for each row and column, which does not maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all possible values of \( n \). The operations described do not ensure that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly once in each row and each column, which is necessary to achieve the maximum possible sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
