The code snippet `mn = 100` assigns the value 100 to the variable `mn`. The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `q` is an input integer; For each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `mn` is 100.**
