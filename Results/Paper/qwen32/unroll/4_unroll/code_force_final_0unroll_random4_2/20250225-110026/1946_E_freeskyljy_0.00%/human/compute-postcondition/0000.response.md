The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The initial state describes the conditions for `t`, `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, and the lists `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}`. However, the code only affects `N`, `M1`, and `M2`.

Here's the output state after the execution of the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= p_i <= n. `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= s_i <= n. The sum of the values of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input.**

In simpler terms, the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are now set to the integers read from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
