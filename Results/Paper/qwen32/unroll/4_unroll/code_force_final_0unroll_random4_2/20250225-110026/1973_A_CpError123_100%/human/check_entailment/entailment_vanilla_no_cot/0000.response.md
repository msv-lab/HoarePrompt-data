To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic it uses to solve the problem.

The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading three integers representing the scores of the three players. It then checks if the sum of the scores is even, because the total points distributed in any game (either 2 or 2 in case of a win-lose, or 1+1 in case of a draw) must be even. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1.

The next step in the program is to calculate two values:
- `x = (a + b + c) // 2`: This represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points in total (either 2 for a win-lose or 1+1 for a draw).
- `y = a + b`: This represents the total points of the two players with the lower scores.

The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This logic is intended to find the maximum number of draws because:
- `x` is the total number of games played.
- `y` is the total points of the two players with the lower scores, and if there are draws, these points could have been achieved with fewer games, leaving more games to be draws.

However, this logic is not entirely correct. The program does not fully account for all possible scenarios and constraints that ensure the scores are valid. For example, it does not consider cases where the highest score cannot be achieved given the other scores and the number of games.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- Input: `1 1 10`
- The sum of scores is `12`, which is even.
- `x = 12 // 2 = 6` (total games played)
- `y = 1 + 1 = 2` (points of the two players with the lower scores)
- The program will print `min(6, 2) = 2`.

However, in this case, it is impossible to achieve the scores `1 1 10` with only 2 draws and 4 other games. The correct answer should be `-1` because the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
