You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted integer scores. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates two values: half of the total sum and the sum of the two lower scores, then outputs the smaller of these two values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` of three players.
- The scores are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order: `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- If the scores are not possible with a valid set of games, the program should output `-1`.
- The total points `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even because each game contributes 2 points in total (either 2-0 or 1-1).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores.

2. **Even Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If it's odd, it prints `-1` because the total points from all games must be even.
   - This is correct because each game results in 2 points being distributed among the players.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points).
   - The program calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points that players 1 and 2 have together.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which is intended to represent the maximum number of draws.

### Evaluation of the Logic:
- The logic for checking if the total points are even is correct.
- The calculation of `x` is correct as it represents the total number of games played.
- The calculation of `y` is also correct as it represents the total points of players 1 and 2.
- However, the logic to determine the maximum number of draws is flawed.

### Flaw in the Logic:
- The maximum number of draws cannot be simply the minimum of the total number of games and the combined points of two players.
- The correct approach would involve considering the constraints and the distribution of points more carefully. For example, the difference between `p3` and the sum of `p1` and `p2` must be even and non-negative, and the total points must be consistent with the possible game outcomes.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed logic for determining the maximum number of draws, the program is incorrect.
