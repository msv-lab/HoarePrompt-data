Reasoning:  
The program checks if the total points (sum of p1, p2, and p3) is even. This is a necessary condition because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 for a win/loss or 1-1 for a draw). If the total points are odd, it is impossible to have distributed them among the games, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

The program then calculates two values:
- `x = (a + b + c) // 2`: This represents the maximum number of games played, since each game contributes 2 points.
- `y = a + b`: This represents the total points that the two lower-scoring players have, which is the maximum number of points that could have been accumulated without any draws (i.e., all games between these two players ended in a win/loss for one of them).

The program outputs the minimum of these two values because the actual number of draws cannot exceed the number of games played, and it also cannot exceed the points accumulated by the two lower-scoring players (since any draw must involve one of these two players).

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description and the given examples. The program correctly handles the cases where the total points are odd, and it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for each valid test case.

Correctness: **True**
