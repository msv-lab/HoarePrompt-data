Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String Construction**:
   - The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string by alternating between the top and bottom rows based on a condition involving the next character in the top row and the current character in the bottom row. However, this approach does not guarantee the smallest string, as it might not explore all possible paths and their corresponding strings.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The program counts the number of paths that yield the smallest string by checking if the characters in the top and bottom rows are equal or if the top row has a '0' and the bottom row has a '1'. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for all possible paths that yield the smallest string.

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach should be used. The idea is to maintain two arrays:
- `dp_min[i]` to store the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed up to the i-th column.
- `dp_count[i]` to store the number of paths that yield the smallest string up to the i-th column.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        
        dp_min = [''] * (n + 1)
        dp_count = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        dp_min[0] = ''
        dp_count[0] = 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                dp_min[i + 1] = dp_min[i] + a[i]
                dp_count[i + 1] = dp_count[i]
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                dp_min[i + 1] = dp_min[i] + b[i]
                dp_count[i + 1] = dp_count[i]
            else:
                dp_min[i + 1] = dp_min[i] + a[i]
                dp_count[i + 1] = dp_count[i] * 2
        
        print(dp_min[n])
        print(dp_count[n])

func()
```

This implementation correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.
