You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a length `n` and two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of a grid. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from the top and bottom strings based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also calculates and prints a counter that represents the length of the longest prefix of the top string that matches the bottom string, with the additional condition that '0' in the top string can match '1' in the bottom string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the approach the program takes to solve it.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Objective**: Find the lexicographically smallest binary string that can be formed by moving from the top-left corner (1,1) to the bottom-right corner (2,n) in a 2xN grid, where you can only move right or down.
2. **Objective 2**: Count the number of such paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string.

### Approach:
1. **Path Selection**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the path.
   - It iterates through each column of the grid.
   - The variable `work` is used to determine whether the grasshopper is in the top row (`True`) or the bottom row (`False`).
   - If the grasshopper is in the top row (`work == True`), it appends the current cell of the top row to `ans`.
   - It then checks if moving down to the cell in the bottom row would result in a lexicographically smaller string. If so, it switches to the bottom row (`work = False`).
   - If the grasshopper reaches the last column, it appends the last cell of the bottom row to `ans` and breaks the loop.
   - If the grasshopper is in the bottom row (`work == False`), it appends the current cell of the bottom row to `ans` and continues to the next column.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The program initializes a counter to 1.
   - It then iterates through the columns of the grid, checking if the top row and bottom row have the same value at the current and next positions.
   - If they do, it increments the counter, as this means there is an alternative path that can be taken.
   - If the top row has a '0' and the bottom row has a '1' at the current position, it resets the counter to 1 because this means the path must switch to the top row to maintain the lexicographically smallest string.
   - If neither condition is met, it breaks the loop as the paths can no longer be the same.

### Analysis:
1. **Path Selection**:
   - The logic for selecting the path is correct. The grasshopper switches to the bottom row only when it results in a lexicographically smaller string, and it correctly handles the case when it reaches the last column.
   
2. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The logic for counting the number of paths is flawed. The program only considers the case where the top row and bottom row have the same value at the current and next positions. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper can switch between rows multiple times while maintaining the lexicographically smallest string.
   - For example, in the third test case of the example input, the correct lexicographically smallest string is `001001101`, and there are 4 paths that yield this string. However, the program will only count 1 path because it does not correctly handle multiple switches between rows.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
