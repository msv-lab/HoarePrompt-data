You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Program:

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()

            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        print(ans)
        counter = 1
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        print(counter)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a length `n` and two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of a grid. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from the top and bottom strings based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also calculates and prints a counter that represents the length of the longest prefix of the top string that matches the bottom string, with the additional condition that '0' in the top string can match '1' in the bottom string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string is flawed.

Let's analyze the provided code and identify the issues:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The code attempts to construct the smallest string by choosing the smaller value between the two cells at each step, but it does not correctly handle the transitions between rows (from row 1 to row 2 or vice versa).
   - The code does not correctly account for the possibility of switching rows to achieve a smaller string.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The count of paths yielding the smallest string is incorrect because it only considers a very specific pattern of switching rows, which might not cover all possible paths that yield the smallest string.

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
0111
1000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0000
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The lexicographically smallest string is `0000`, which can be achieved by the following paths:
  1. Path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4)
  2. Path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0100
1
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The program constructs the string `0100` by choosing the smaller value at each step without correctly considering the possibility of switching rows to get a smaller string.
- The count of paths is `1` because the program does not account for the second path that yields `0000`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases and does not produce the correct output for the given test case.
