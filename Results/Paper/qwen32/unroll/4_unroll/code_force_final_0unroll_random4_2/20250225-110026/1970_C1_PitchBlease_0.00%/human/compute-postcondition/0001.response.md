The code initializes a set named `visited` with the single element `start`. This means that the node identified by `start` is now marked as visited. The values of `start`, `target`, `tree`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node identifiers in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with n nodes, where each node has a list of its neighbors; `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.**
