The code initializes a queue with a tuple containing the `start` node identifier and the distance `0`. This means the queue now contains the initial node to start the search from, along with its initial distance from itself, which is `0`. The variables `start` and `target` remain unchanged as they are part of the precondition and are not modified by this line of code. The `tree` variable, which is an adjacency list representation of the tree, is also not affected.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node identifiers in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with n nodes, where each node has a list of its neighbors. `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`.**
