In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. The variables `n` and `p` are defined within each iteration of the loop and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which is `t`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Since the problem states that `1 <= t <= 5000`, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
