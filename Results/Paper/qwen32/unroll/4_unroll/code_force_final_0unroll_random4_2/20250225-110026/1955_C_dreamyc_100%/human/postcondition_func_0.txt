The function `func_1` takes three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the count of iterations where the cumulative sum of elements from the start (`s_a`) is less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the cumulative sum of elements from the end (`s_b`) is less than or equal to `b` (which is `k // 2`).
