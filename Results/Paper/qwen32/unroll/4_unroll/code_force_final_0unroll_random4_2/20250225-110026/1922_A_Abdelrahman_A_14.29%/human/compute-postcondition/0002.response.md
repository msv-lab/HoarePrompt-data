Output State: **After all iterations, the variables `t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their initial values, and no further changes are made to them. The variable `no` is not retained as it is local to each iteration. The program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
