Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues and does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Global Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is used inside `func_1` without being passed as an argument. This will result in a `NameError` since `n` is not defined in the scope of `func_1`.

2. **Logic Errors**: The logic in `func_1` to determine the maximum number of wins is incorrect. The function is trying to find the indices of the first two cows with a higher rating than the cow at index `k`, but it does not correctly handle the cases where the cow at index `k` can win more matches by swapping positions.

3. **Handling of Swapping**: The problem allows for one swap to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`. The provided program does not attempt to find the optimal position to swap cow `k` with another cow to maximize its wins.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when cow `k` has the highest rating and can win all matches or when cow `k` is initially in a position where it can win no matches.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:

- Iterate through each possible position to swap cow `k` with another cow.
- Simulate the matches for each possible swap to determine the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.
- Return the maximum number of wins found.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins(n, k, ratings):
    k -= 1
    original_wins = 0
    current_max = ratings[k]
    
    # Calculate original wins without any swap
    for i in range(k + 1, n):
        if ratings[i] > current_max:
            break
        original_wins += 1
        current_max = ratings[i]
    
    max_wins = original_wins
    
    # Try swapping with each cow and calculate wins
    for i in range(n):
        if i == k:
            continue
        swapped_ratings = ratings[:]
        swapped_ratings[i], swapped_ratings[k] = swapped_ratings[k], swapped_ratings[i]
        
        current_wins = 0
        current_max = swapped_ratings[k]
        
        if i < k:
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if swapped_ratings[j] > current_max:
                    break
                current_wins += 1
                current_max = swapped_ratings[j]
        else:
            for j in range(k + 1, n):
                if swapped_ratings[j] > current_max:
                    break
                current_wins += 1
                current_max = swapped_ratings[j]
        
        max_wins = max(max_wins, current_wins)
    
    return max_wins

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_wins(n, k, ratings))
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve by either doing nothing or swapping with another cow once.
