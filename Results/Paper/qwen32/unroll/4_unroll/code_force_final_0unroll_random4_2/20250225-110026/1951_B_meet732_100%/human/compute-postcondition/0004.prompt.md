Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list containing multiple test cases. Each test case is represented as a list where the first element is a list of two integers [n, k] with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the second element is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where each rating is a unique integer between 1 and 10^9. The total number of cows across all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value at index `k-1` of the ratings list of the first test case; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
