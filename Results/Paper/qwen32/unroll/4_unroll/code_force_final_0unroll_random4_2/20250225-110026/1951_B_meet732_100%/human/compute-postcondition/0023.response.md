Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`**

Natural Language Explanation: The program calculates the maximum of two values: the first is `ind[0] - 1`, and the second is `k - ind[0]`. Given that `ind` is a list containing up to 2 indices of ratings greater than `x`, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`, the program returns whichever of these two calculated values is larger.
