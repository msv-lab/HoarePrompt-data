You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` segments where each segment includes all `k` distinct characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If such segments exist, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string that includes the maximum number of segments with all `k` distinct characters and additional characters to meet the requirement of `n` segments.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why it fails:

1. **Subsequence Check**: The program attempts to count the number of times all possible subsequences of length \( k \) appear in the string \( s \). However, it does not correctly check for all possible subsequences of length \( n \). Instead, it seems to be checking for the presence of all possible characters (up to \( k \)) in a sliding window manner, which is incorrect for the problem requirements.

2. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**: When the program determines that not all subsequences appear, it generates a string that does not appear as a subsequence. However, the logic used to generate this string is flawed. It does not guarantee that the generated string is the shortest possible subsequence that is missing from \( s \).

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle several edge cases correctly:
   - If \( n = 1 \), it should simply check if all characters from 'a' to 'k' are present in \( s \).
   - If \( k = 1 \), it should check if the string \( s \) contains the character 'a' repeated \( n \) times.
   - If \( n \) is large and \( k \) is small, the program might not generate the correct missing subsequence.

Let's consider a specific example where the program fails:

**Example**:
```
Input:
1
3 2 5
ababa

Expected Output:
NO
aaa
```

**Explanation**:
- All possible strings of length 3 using 'a' and 'b' are: "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb".
- The string "aaa" is not a subsequence of "ababa".
- The program might not correctly identify "aaa" as the missing subsequence and instead might generate some other incorrect string.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
