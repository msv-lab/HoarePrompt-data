The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` segments where each segment includes all `k` distinct characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If such segments exist, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string that includes the maximum number of segments with all `k` distinct characters and additional characters to meet the requirement of `n` segments.
