You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s` are from the last test case, `cnt` is the count of segments with all `k` distinct characters from the last test case, `cur` is the bitmask of characters in the last segment of the last test case, `tmp` and `ans` are constructed based on the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, a specific string that does not occur as a subsequence should be provided.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a bitmask approach to track subsequences. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are read.
   - The string `s` of length `m` is read.

2. **Bitmask Approach:**
   - A bitmask `cur` is used to track which characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets have been encountered in the current subsequence.
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include this character if it hasn't been included already.
   - If the bitmask `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been encountered in the current subsequence, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - The bitmask `cur` is then reset to `0`.

3. **Checking Subsequences:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and attempts to construct a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - It starts by creating a string `ans` consisting of the last character of the first `k` characters repeated `cnt` times.
   - It then tries to append the first character that hasn't been encountered in the bitmask `cur` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it appends 'a' characters to `ans` until it reaches the required length `n`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Bitmask Resetting Logic:**
   - The bitmask `cur` is reset to `0` only when all `k` characters have been encountered. This means it does not correctly track subsequences of length `n`.
   - The program does not actually count subsequences of length `n`; it counts how many times all `k` characters appear in the string `s` in order, which is not equivalent to counting all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The logic for constructing the missing subsequence is flawed. It does not correctly identify a string of length `n` that is missing as a subsequence.
   - The program assumes that the first character not in `cur` can be appended to form a missing subsequence, which is not necessarily true.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not accurately count all possible subsequences of length `n` and does not correctly identify a missing subsequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
