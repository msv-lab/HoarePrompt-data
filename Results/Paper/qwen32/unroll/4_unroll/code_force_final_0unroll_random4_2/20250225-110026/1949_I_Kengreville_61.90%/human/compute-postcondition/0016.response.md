The initial state describes several variables and their properties, including `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, and `ok`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement explicitly prints the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, or `ok`.

Output: **NO**
