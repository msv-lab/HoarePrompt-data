### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its function summaries in the context of the problem description. We'll break down the code and assess whether it correctly implements the logic required to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted as specified.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Tangency Condition**: Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. **Non-overlap Condition**: No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
3. **Sum Decrease Condition**: The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The code uses global variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` within `dfs`. This is a design flaw because it makes the code harder to understand and maintain. However, for the sake of this analysis, we will assume that these variables are correctly initialized in `func_1` before `dfs` is called.

2. **DFS Logic**:
   - The `dfs` function is intended to traverse all disks that are connected through tangency starting from a given disk index `i`.
   - It updates the `visited` list to mark disks as visited and adds them to the `nodes` list.
   - It calculates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for each disk in the connected component. These coefficients are used to check if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem requirements.

3. **Tangency Check**:
   - The tangency condition is correctly checked using the formula `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`. This formula checks if the distance between the centers of two disks is equal to the sum of their radii, indicating tangency.

4. **Sum Decrease Check**:
   - The code checks if `c1 != 0` after processing all disks in a connected component. This check is intended to determine if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. However, the logic for this check is not clear from the given code and function summary.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary for `dfs` states that it performs a DFS starting from a given disk index `i`, marks disks as visited, adds their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates `coef0` and `coef1` with coefficients related to the constraints on the radii of the disks in the connected component. This summary aligns with the observed behavior of the code.

#### Issues Identified:
- The code does not explicitly handle the sum decrease condition. The check `c1 != 0` seems to be a heuristic or placeholder for this condition, but its correctness is not evident from the provided code and summary.
- The use of global variables can lead to bugs and makes the code less modular and harder to debug.

#### Example Case Analysis:
- **Example 1**:
  ```
  5
  0 2 1
  0 0 1
  4 -3 4
  11 0 3
  11 5 2
  ```
  - The code should output `YES` because it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases while maintaining tangency and no overlap.
- **Example 2**:
  ```
  4
  2 2 2
  7 2 3
  7 7 2
  2 7 3
  ```
  - The code should output `NO` because there is no way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases while maintaining tangency and no overlap.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the code does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. The check `c1 != 0` is not sufficient to guarantee that the sum of the radii will decrease. Therefore, the original assessment that the code is incorrect is accurate.

### Final: **False**
