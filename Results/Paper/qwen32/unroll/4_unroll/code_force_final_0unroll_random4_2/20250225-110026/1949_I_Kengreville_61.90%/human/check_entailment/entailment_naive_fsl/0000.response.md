Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements. The function `func_1` and `dfs` are supposed to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted such that disks that were tangent remain tangent, no two disks overlap, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases. However, the code does not properly implement this logic.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are defined in `func_1` but are used in `dfs` without being passed as arguments. This can lead to undefined behavior or errors if `dfs` is called outside of `func_1`.

2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS logic in `dfs` seems to be trying to check if there's a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases, but the implementation is incomplete and incorrect. The logic for adjusting the coefficients and checking tangency conditions is not correctly implemented.

3. **Tangency Check**: The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. However, the code does not correctly handle the adjustment of radii to ensure the sum strictly decreases.

4. **Sum Decrease Check**: The code does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. It only checks if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the disks remain tangent and do not overlap, but it does not verify the sum of the radii.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
6 0 1
```
The disks are tangent to each other in a line. The code should output `NO` because there is no way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and no overlap. However, the current code might incorrectly output `YES` due to the incomplete logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the code and the example where it fails, the correctness of the program is `False`.
