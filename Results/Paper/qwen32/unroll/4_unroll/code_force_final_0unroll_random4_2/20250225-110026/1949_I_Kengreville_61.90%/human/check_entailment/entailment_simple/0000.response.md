### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that they remain tangent to each other, do not overlap, and the sum of their radii strictly decreases.

The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. For each connected component, it assigns coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) to the disks to represent the constraints on the radii. Specifically, it tries to determine if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii in the component can be reduced while maintaining the tangency conditions.

The key idea is that if the sum of `coef1` values for a connected component is non-zero, then it is possible to adjust the radii in a way that decreases the total sum of radii while maintaining the tangency conditions. This is because the coefficients represent a system of linear equations that can be solved to find a valid set of radii.

However, there are several issues with the provided program:

1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `n` are used in both `func_1` and `dfs` without being passed as arguments or declared as global. This can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results if the function is called in a different context or if there are other functions using the same variable names.

2. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function `dfs` is supposed to explore all disks connected to the current disk `i` that are tangent to it. However, the logic for checking tangency is correct (`(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`), but the coefficients (`coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`) are not correctly set up to ensure that the sum of radii can be strictly decreased.

3. **Output Logic**: The program checks if `c1 != 0` for any connected component to determine if the radii can be adjusted. However, this logic is not sufficient to guarantee that the sum of radii can be strictly decreased. The coefficients need to be set up correctly to ensure that the system of equations can be solved to find a valid set of radii.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **False**
