The code `nodes.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `nodes`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `nodes` now containing the index `i`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks, respectively. `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and `visited[i]` is True. `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component and now includes `i`. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of values that will be used to store coefficients for the system of equations representing the constraints on the radii.**
