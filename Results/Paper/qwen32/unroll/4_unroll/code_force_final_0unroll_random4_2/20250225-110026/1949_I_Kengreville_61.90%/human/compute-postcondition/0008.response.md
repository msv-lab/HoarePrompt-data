The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is set by the `range(n)` function in the loop head. The state of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`) does not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
