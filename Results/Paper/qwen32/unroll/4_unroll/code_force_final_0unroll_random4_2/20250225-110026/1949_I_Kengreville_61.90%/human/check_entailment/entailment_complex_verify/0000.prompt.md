You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values representing disks with their centers and radii, performs some form of traversal (likely depth-first search) on these disks, and prints "YES" if any traversal results in a non-zero sum of certain coefficients (`coef1`), otherwise it prints "NO". The function modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists during its execution.

It marks the disk and all disks directly connected to it as visited, adds their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with coefficients related to the constraints on the radii of the disks in the connected component.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements. The function `func_1` and `dfs` are supposed to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted such that disks that were tangent remain tangent, no two disks overlap, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases. However, the code does not properly implement this logic.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are defined in `func_1` but are used in `dfs` without being passed as arguments. This can lead to undefined behavior or errors if `dfs` is called outside of `func_1`.

2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS logic in `dfs` seems to be trying to check if there's a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases, but the implementation is incomplete and incorrect. The logic for adjusting the coefficients and checking tangency conditions is not correctly implemented.

3. **Tangency Check**: The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. However, the code does not correctly handle the adjustment of radii to ensure the sum strictly decreases.

4. **Sum Decrease Check**: The code does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. It only checks if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the disks remain tangent and do not overlap, but it does not verify the sum of the radii.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
6 0 1
```
The disks are tangent to each other in a line. The code should output `NO` because there is no way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and no overlap. However, the current code might incorrectly output `YES` due to the incomplete logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the code and the example where it fails, the correctness of the program is `False`.
