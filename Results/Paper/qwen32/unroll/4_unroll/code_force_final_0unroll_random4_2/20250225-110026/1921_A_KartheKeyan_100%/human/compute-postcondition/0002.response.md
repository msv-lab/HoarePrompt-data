To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition. The `while` loop in question is:

```python
while n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, while `0` is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is any non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` holds the value calculated for the last test case
- `l` holds the value of the side length from the last test case

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Since `n` is described as "an input integer," it already suggests that `n` can be any integer value. However, to explicitly ensure the loop executes, we need to specify that `n` should not be zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is not zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `s` holds the value calculated for the last test case; `l` holds the value of the side length from the last test case**
