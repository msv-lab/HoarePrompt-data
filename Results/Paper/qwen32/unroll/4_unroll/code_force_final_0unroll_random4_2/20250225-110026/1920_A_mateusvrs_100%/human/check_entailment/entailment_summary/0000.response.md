### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by processing each test case individually. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `ax` (which will hold the minimum value from type 2 constraints) to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`), and `bx` (which will hold the maximum value from type 1 constraints) to a very small number (`-1`).

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program checks the type (`a`):
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x` (since `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`).
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x` (since `k` must be less than or equal to `x`).
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to a set `cx` (since `k` must not be equal to `x`).

3. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx > ax`. If `bx` (the minimum value `k` can take) is greater than `ax` (the maximum value `k` can take), it means no integer `k` can satisfy all constraints, and the program appends `0` to the result list `r`.

4. **Counting Valid `k` Values**:
   - If `bx <= ax`, the program calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid `k` values.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It properly updates the bounds for `k` based on type 1 and type 2 constraints and correctly excludes values specified in type 3 constraints. The logic for checking if no valid `k` exists (`bx > ax`) is also correct.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
