You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and returns an integer based on the constraints: if the maximum value from type 1 constraints is greater than the minimum value from type 2 constraints, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns the count of integers within the range defined by these constraints, excluding those specified in type 3 constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly account for the constraints when `bx` (the maximum lower bound) is equal to `ax` (the minimum upper bound). 

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

### Example Input:
```
1
3
1 5
2 5
3 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
0
```

### Explanation of the Example:
- We have one constraint of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to 5) and one constraint of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to 5). The third constraint is that k must not be equal to 5.
- There are no integers that satisfy all these constraints, so the output should be 0.

### Program Output for the Example:
The program will output `1` for this input, which is incorrect. Here's why:

- `bx` will be set to 5 because of the constraint `1 5`.
- `ax` will be set to 5 because of the constraint `2 5`.
- The set `cx` will contain the value 5 because of the constraint `3 5`.
- Since `bx` is not greater than `ax`, the program will proceed to calculate the number of valid integers.
- It will subtract the count of numbers in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]` from the range size `ax - bx + 1`. In this case, it will subtract 1 (the number 5) from 1 (the range size from 5 to 5), resulting in 0.

However, because the range size is exactly 1 and the number 5 is excluded by the constraint `3 5`, the correct output should be 0, not 1.

This demonstrates that the program is not handling the edge case where `bx` equals `ax` correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
