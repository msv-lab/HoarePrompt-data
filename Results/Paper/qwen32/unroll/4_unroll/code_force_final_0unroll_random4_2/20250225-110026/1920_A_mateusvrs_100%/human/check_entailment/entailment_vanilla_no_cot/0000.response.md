Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the condition to determine if the constraints are contradictory. Specifically, the program checks if `bx > ax` to determine if there are no valid values for `k`. However, `bx` is the maximum lower bound, and `ax` is the minimum upper bound. Therefore, the correct condition should be `bx > ax` indicating no overlap, which is correctly handled. The issue lies in the calculation of the number of valid `k` values.

The program correctly calculates `bx` as the maximum value of all lower bounds (type 1 constraints) and `ax` as the minimum value of all upper bounds (type 2 constraints). However, the calculation of valid `k` values is incorrect. The program subtracts the count of excluded values (`tmp`) from the range `(ax - bx + 1)`, which is correct. But the range `(ax - bx + 1)` should be calculated only if `bx <= ax`.

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case where `bx == ax`. If `bx == ax`, there is exactly one possible value for `k`, which is `bx` (or `ax`), and it should be checked if this value is excluded by any type 3 constraints.

Here is the corrected part of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            if bx == ax:
                r.append(1 if bx not in cx else 0)
            else:
                r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

This handles the edge case where `bx == ax` correctly.
