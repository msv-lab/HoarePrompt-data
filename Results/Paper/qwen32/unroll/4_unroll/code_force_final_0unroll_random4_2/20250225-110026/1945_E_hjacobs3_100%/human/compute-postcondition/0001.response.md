The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `l` and the value `n` to the variable `r`. The values of `array`, `find`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n`.**
