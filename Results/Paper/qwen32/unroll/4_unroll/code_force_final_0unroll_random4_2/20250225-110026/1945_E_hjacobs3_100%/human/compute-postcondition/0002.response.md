To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `r - l > 1`. This condition must be true for the loop to run.

Given:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5).
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n`.

The loop condition is `r - l > 1`. Let's analyze this:

- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is initialized to `n`.

For the loop to execute, `r - l` must be greater than 1. Therefore:
\[ r - l > 1 \]
\[ n - 0 > 1 \]
\[ n > 1 \]

This means that `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. If `n` is 1, then `r - l` will be 1, and the loop will not execute.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `n` to ensure that it is greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`**
