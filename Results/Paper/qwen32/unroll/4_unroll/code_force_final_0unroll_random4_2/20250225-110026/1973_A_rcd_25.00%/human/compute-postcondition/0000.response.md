The code snippet provided is:
```
t = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given that the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, the execution of this line will update the value of `t` to whatever integer is provided by the input. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user (where 1 <= `t` <= 500); `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30.**
