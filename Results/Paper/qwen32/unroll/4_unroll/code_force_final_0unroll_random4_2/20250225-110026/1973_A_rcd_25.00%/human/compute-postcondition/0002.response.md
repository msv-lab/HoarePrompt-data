Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of each iteration of the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are updated with the values provided in each iteration's input. The output for each iteration is determined by the conditions specified in the loop: if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it prints `-1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value that can be achieved under the given constraints and prints it. The state of other variables not involved in the loop remains unchanged.**
