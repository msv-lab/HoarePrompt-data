### Reasoning:

The provided Python function aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred based on the scores of three players after a series of chess games. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players. It is guaranteed that `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.

2. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The sum of the scores `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even for the scores to be valid. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner, or 1 each in case of a draw). If the total sum is odd, it is impossible to achieve these scores with a valid set of games, and the function correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest-scoring player (`p3`) could have played all games against the other two players, winning some and drawing the rest. Since `p1 + p2` represents the total points of the other two players, the maximum draws would be equal to their total points.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the function calculates the possible maximum number of draws through a loop:
     - It calculates `low` and `high` values, which represent the minimum and maximum possible differences between `p3` and the other scores.
     - It then iterates over possible values of draws (`cur`), checking if the remaining points for `p1` and `p2` can be distributed in a valid way. If a valid distribution is found, it prints the total number of draws (`p1 - cur + p3`).
     - If no valid distribution is found after the loop, it defaults to printing `p3`.

### Correctness:

The function correctly handles the constraints and logic described in the problem statement. It checks for invalid total scores and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given conditions. The loop logic ensures that all possible distributions of points are considered to find the maximum number of draws.

Thus, the program is correct for the given problem and test cases.

**Correctness: True**
