You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))

                    cur += 1
            else:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of each iteration of the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are updated with the values provided in each iteration's input. The output for each iteration is determined by the conditions specified in the loop: if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it prints `-1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value that can be achieved under the given constraints and prints it. The state of other variables not involved in the loop remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description and the given examples.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players (p1, p2, p3) after playing a series of chess games. The constraints are:

- p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3
- Each win gives 2 points to the winner, and each draw gives 1 point to each player.
- We need to find the maximum number of draws or determine if the scores are inconsistent.

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program follows these steps:

1. **Read the number of test cases (t)**.
2. **For each test case**:
   - Read the scores of the three players (p1, p2, p3).
   - Check if the sum of the scores is even. If not, print -1 (since points are always given in pairs, the total points must be even).
   - If p3 (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, then the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the possible range of draws and iterates through it to find a valid configuration of games that matches the given scores.

### Edge Cases and Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Example 1:
Input: `0 0 0`
Output: `0`
- No games were played, so no draws.

#### Example 2:
Input: `0 1 1`
Output: `1`
- One draw between the second and third player.

#### Example 3:
Input: `1 1 1`
Output: `-1`
- Impossible to achieve these scores with given rules.

#### Example 4:
Input: `1 1 2`
Output: `2`
- Two games: one draw and one win.

#### Example 5:
Input: `3 3 3`
Output: `-1`
- Impossible to achieve these scores with given rules.

#### Example 6:
Input: `3 4 5`
Output: `6`
- Possible configuration: 3 wins for the third player, 1 draw between the first and second player.

#### Example 7:
Input: `1 1 10`
Output: `2`
- Possible configuration: 5 wins for the third player, 1 draw between the first and second player.

### Additional Edge Cases

#### Case 1:
Input: `0 0 2`
Output: `0`
- One game where the third player won.

#### Case 2:
Input: `0 2 2`
Output: `1`
- One game where the second player won, one draw between the first and third player.

#### Case 3:
Input: `2 2 4`
Output: `2`
- Two wins for the third player, one draw between the first and second player.

### Conclusion

After verifying multiple cases, including edge cases, the provided program seems to correctly handle all scenarios as per the problem description. It correctly identifies impossible score configurations and calculates the maximum number of draws for possible configurations.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all test cases and edge cases, ensuring that it either calculates the maximum number of draws or identifies inconsistent scores.
