Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of distinct types of cards and `k` represents the number of coins. It also accepts a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each integer represents the number of cards of type `i` initially available. The function returns the maximum number of additional cards that can be obtained given the number of coins `k` and the initial availability of each card type.**
