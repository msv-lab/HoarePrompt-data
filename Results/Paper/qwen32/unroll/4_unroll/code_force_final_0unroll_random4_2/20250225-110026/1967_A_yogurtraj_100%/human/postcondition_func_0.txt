The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of distinct types of cards, an integer `k` representing the number of coins, and a list of `n` integers representing the initial count of each card type. It calculates and prints the maximum number of additional cards that can be obtained given the number of coins and the initial availability of each card type.
