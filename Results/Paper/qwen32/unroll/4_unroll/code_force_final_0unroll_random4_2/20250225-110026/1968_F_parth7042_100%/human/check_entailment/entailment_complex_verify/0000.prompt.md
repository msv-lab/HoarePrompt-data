You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to determine whether a subarray is "interesting" based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the key components and how they align with the requirements:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR values for the array. This is done using the line `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   - The prefix XOR is crucial because it allows for quick XOR calculations of any subarray. Specifically, the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` can be computed as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs. This is done with the line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`.
   - This mapping helps in quickly finding if there are any other indices with the same prefix XOR value, which is essential for determining if the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the entire subarray has an XOR of 0, which implies that it can trivially be split into any number of segments with equal XOR (0).
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the lists stored in `mp`.
   - If such indices are found, it means the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values, and the program appends "YES" to the results. Otherwise, it appends "NO".

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x == 0` separately, which is a valid scenario for the subarray to be interesting.
   - The use of binary search ensures that the program efficiently checks for the existence of required indices, which is crucial given the constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for all queries and prints them in the required format.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if a subarray is interesting, and it handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
