Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query asks whether there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a bitwise XOR of zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, for each query.**
