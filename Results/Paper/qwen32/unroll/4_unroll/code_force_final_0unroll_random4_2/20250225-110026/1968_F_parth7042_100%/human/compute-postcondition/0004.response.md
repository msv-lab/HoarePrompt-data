The given code snippet only initializes an empty list named `results`. It does not modify any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `data`, `index`). Therefore, after executing this code, the state of the program is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; each of the `q` queries is a pair of integers (l, r) such that 1 <= l < r <= n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
