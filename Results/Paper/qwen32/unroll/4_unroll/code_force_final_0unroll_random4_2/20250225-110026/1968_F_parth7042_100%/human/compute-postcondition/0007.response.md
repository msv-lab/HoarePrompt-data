To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis
1. **t**: The number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **n** and **q**: For each test case, `n` is the number of integers in the list `a`, and `q` is the number of queries. The constraints are \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
3. **a**: A list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
4. **Queries**: Each query is a pair of integers (l, r) such that \(1 \leq l < r \leq n\).
5. **data**: A list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
6. **index**: Calculated as 1 plus twice the total number of test cases plus the sum of `n` for all test cases.
7. **results**: A list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to the answers of the queries for all test cases.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation
The `print` statement joins all the strings in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and prints the resulting string. The `results` list contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query in each test case.

### Output Description
The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line, corresponding to the answers of the queries for all test cases.

### Final Output
Since the exact contents of the `results` list are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the `results` list:

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' for each query, each on a new line (where 'YES' or 'NO' corresponds to the answers of the queries for all test cases)**
