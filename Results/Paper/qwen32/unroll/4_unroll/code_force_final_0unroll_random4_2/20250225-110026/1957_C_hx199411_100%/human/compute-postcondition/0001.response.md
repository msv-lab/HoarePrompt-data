The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `t` will always be greater than 0, and thus the loop can certainly execute one time.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the range that allows the loop to execute, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`. It is guaranteed that the `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
