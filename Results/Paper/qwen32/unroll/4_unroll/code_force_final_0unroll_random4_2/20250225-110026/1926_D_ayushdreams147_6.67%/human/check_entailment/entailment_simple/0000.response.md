### Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by counting unique numbers after considering the bitwise flipped version of each number. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required based on the problem's constraints.

The problem requires that for any two numbers in the same group, no two corresponding bits (from 1st to 31st) can be the same. This essentially means that each group can have numbers whose binary representations do not overlap in any of the 31 least significant bits. The correct way to determine the minimum number of groups is to use a greedy approach or a graph-based approach to ensure that no two numbers with matching bits in the same positions are in the same group.

The provided code snippet does not implement this logic. Instead, it counts unique numbers after flipping the bits of each number, which does not address the problem's requirement of ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant positions.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
