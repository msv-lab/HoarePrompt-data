Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from input, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, sorted in non-decreasing order; `present` is a set containing the elements of `a`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values and constraints. The list `a` remains unchanged, and a new set `present` is created containing all the elements of `a`.
