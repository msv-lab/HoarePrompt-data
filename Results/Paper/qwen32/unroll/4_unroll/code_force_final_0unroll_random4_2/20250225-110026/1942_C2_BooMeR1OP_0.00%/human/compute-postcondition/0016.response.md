Functionality: **The function calculates and prints a value `ans` for each test case based on the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, an integer `y`, and a list of `x` distinct chosen vertices. The value `ans` is determined by considering the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and adjusting it based on the value of `y`.**
