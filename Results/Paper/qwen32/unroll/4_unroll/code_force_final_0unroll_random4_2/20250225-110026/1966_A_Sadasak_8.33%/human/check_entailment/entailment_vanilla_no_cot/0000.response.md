Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. Here are the main issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly limits the frequency to `k` for each card. This is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed. The program does not correctly account for how the operations can reduce the number of cards. Specifically:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the process of exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` cards.
   - It does not consider the optimal way to reduce the number of cards based on their frequencies.

3. **Simplistic Checks**: The checks for `k > n` and `k == n` are not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards. The program needs a more comprehensive approach to handle all cases correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Calculate the frequency of each card number.
- For each card number, determine how many times you can perform the operation (i.e., how many full groups of `k` cards you can form).
- Subtract the total number of cards that can be exchanged from the total number of cards.
- The result should be the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    remaining_cards = n
    for count in freq.values():
        # For each card number, reduce the count by the maximum number of k-sized groups
        remaining_cards -= (count // k)
    
    # Ensure remaining_cards is at least 1
    remaining_cards = max(remaining_cards, 1)
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

This corrected program calculates the frequency of each card, determines how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed for each card number, and subtracts the total number of cards that can be exchanged. The result is the minimum number of cards left.
