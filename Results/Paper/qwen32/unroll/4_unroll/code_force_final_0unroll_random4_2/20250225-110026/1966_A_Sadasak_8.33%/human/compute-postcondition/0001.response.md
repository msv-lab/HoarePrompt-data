The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list `arr` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The state of `k` and `frequency_table` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least one integer. The value of `num` will be the first element of `arr` during the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first integer in `arr`**
