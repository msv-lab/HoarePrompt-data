### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program's logic. Let's break down the issues and validate the reasoning.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, and the list of card numbers.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `k > n` and `k == n` by printing `n` and `k - 1` respectively.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The core issue lies in the function `func_1`, which is supposed to compute the frequency of each card number but incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This capping does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
   - The check `if k in freq.values():` is not a reliable way to determine the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach involves calculating the remainder of the division of the frequency of each number by `k - 1` and summing these remainders.

### Correct Approach:
- For each unique card number, determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards are left over after forming these groups. Specifically, for a card number that appears `count` times, the number of cards left after performing the operations is `count % (k - 1)`.
- Sum these remainders across all unique card numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Example:
For the first test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `k = 3`, `nums = [4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`
- Frequencies: `4` appears 3 times, `1` appears 2 times.
- After operations: `4` can be reduced to `3 % (3 - 1) = 1` card, and `1` can be reduced to `2 % (3 - 1) = 0` cards.
- Total remaining cards: `1 + 0 = 1`.

However, the given program does not implement this logic correctly. It incorrectly caps the frequency at `k` and checks if `k` is in the frequency table, which does not provide the correct result.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified flaws and the need for a different approach to solve the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
