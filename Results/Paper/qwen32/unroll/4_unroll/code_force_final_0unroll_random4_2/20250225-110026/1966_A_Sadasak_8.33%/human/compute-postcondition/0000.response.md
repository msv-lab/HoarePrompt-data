The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This dictionary will be used to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`. However, the code snippet does not modify the existing variables `arr` and `k`, nor does it perform any operations that would change their values. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `frequency_table` dictionary.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**
