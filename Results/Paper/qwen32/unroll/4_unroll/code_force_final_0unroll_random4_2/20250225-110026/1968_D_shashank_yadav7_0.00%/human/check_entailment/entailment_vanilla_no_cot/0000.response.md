Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several logical issues that can lead to incorrect results. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The logic to calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha is flawed. The program attempts to update the scores in each iteration, but it does so incorrectly. Specifically, the lines:
    ```python
    bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    ```
    are incorrect. The `max` function is not needed here, and the way scores are being updated is not consistent with the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop is intended to run for `k` turns, but the decrement of `k` and the break condition are not correctly implemented. The loop should run exactly `k` times, but the current implementation will break prematurely.

3. **Incorrect Index Handling**: The program converts the starting positions `b` and `s` to zero-based indices by subtracting 1. However, the indices in the `p` array are 1-based, so the conversion should be handled correctly throughout the program.

4. **Incorrect Score Initialization**: The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set correctly, but the subsequent updates to these scores are incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to zero-based index
        s -= 1  # Convert to zero-based index
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1  # Move to the next position for Bodya
            s = p[s] - 1  # Move to the next position for Sasha
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the scores are updated correctly for each turn and that the players move to their next positions based on the permutation array `p`.
