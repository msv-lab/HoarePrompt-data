The value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each testcase, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
