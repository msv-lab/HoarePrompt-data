### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` followed by the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert them into 0-based indices, which is appropriate for Python list indexing.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `sp` and `bp` with the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
   - It initializes `bm` and `sm` with the potential scores of Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns, assuming they stay in their positions for all turns. This is not the correct initialization. `bm` and `sm` should start at 0, and the scores should be accumulated based on the game rules.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The loop decrements `k` in each iteration, which is correct.
   - It then adjusts `b` and `s` to the next positions based on the permutation `p`.
   - The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated incorrectly. The program attempts to maximize the scores by adding the maximum of the current score and a calculated future score, but this is not the correct approach. The correct approach should be to simply add the value of the current position to the score in each turn.
   - The variables `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, but this is not used correctly in the score calculation.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores `bm` and `sm` and prints the result.

### Correctness

The main issue with the program is the incorrect calculation of scores `bm` and `sm`. The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The correct approach should be:

- Initialize scores `bm` and `sm` to 0.
- For each turn, add the value of the current position to the respective player's score.
- Move each player to the next position based on the permutation `p`.
- After `k` turns, compare the scores and print the result.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = 0
        sm = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect due to the flawed score calculation logic.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
