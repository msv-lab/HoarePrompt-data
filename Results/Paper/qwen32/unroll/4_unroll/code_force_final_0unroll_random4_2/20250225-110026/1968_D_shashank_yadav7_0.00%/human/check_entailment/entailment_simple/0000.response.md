Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. The program incorrectly updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha within the loop. Specifically, the lines:
   ```python
   bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
   sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
   ```
   do not make sense in the context of the problem. The scores should simply be incremented by the value at the current position, and the players should either stay or move to the next position based on the permutation.

2. The loop iterates `n` times, but it should iterate `k` times, as the game lasts for exactly `k` turns.

3. The initial scores are calculated as `bm = a[b] * k` and `sm = a[s] * k`, which incorrectly assumes that the players stay in their positions for all `k` turns. Instead, the scores should be initialized to `bm = a[b]` and `sm = a[s]`, and then incremented in each turn.

4. The logic for deciding whether to stay or move to the next position based on the permutation is missing. Both players should have the option to either stay or move, but the program does not implement this decision-making process.

5. The variables `sp` and `bp` are used to store the scores of Sasha and Bodya, respectively, but they are not updated correctly within the loop.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

#State: For each testcase, the output will be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm` after the loop completes. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` will remain unchanged from their input values, but `bm` and `sm` will be the final sums calculated in the loop.
```

Correctness: **False**
