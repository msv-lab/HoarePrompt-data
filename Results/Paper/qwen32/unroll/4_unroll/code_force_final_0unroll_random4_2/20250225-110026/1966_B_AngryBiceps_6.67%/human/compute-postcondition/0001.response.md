Output State: **For each test case, the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `t` (the number of test cases) is decremented to 0 after all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` do not retain their values after each iteration as they are reinitialized in each loop iteration.**
