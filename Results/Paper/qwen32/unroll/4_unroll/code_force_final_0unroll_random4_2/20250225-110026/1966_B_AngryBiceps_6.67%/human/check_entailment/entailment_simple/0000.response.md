### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color by performing the specified operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid, `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` characters representing the grid.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If all squares in the grid are already the same color, the answer is trivially "YES".
   - The program checks two specific conditions:
     - If all squares in the first row are the same color and the first row is different from the last row.
     - If all squares in the first column are the same color and the first column is different from the last column.
   - If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO", indicating it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic is based on the observation that if there's a single row or column where all squares are the same color and it differs from the corresponding row or column at the other end of the grid, then it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform through the allowed operations. This is because the operations can only color subrectangles of the same color, and if there's a mismatch between the first and last row/column, there will always be a boundary that cannot be filled uniformly.
   - However, there is a subtle issue: the program checks only the first and last rows and columns, but there could be other rows or columns with the same mismatch that the program doesn't account for. For example, a grid with alternating rows of all 'W' and all 'B' would fail the program's checks but is impossible to make uniform.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program is **not** correct because it does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where there are mismatches in rows or columns other than the first and last ones.

**Correctness: False**
