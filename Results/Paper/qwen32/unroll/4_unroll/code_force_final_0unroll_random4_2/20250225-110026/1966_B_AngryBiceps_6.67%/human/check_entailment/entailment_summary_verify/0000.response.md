### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The logic in the program is insufficient and makes incorrect assumptions about the conditions under which it is possible to change the colors of the grid.

Let's break down the issues in the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Conditions**: The program checks if all elements in the first row are the same and different from the last row, or if all elements in the first column are the same and different from the last column. These conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color.

2. **Insufficient Logic**: The program does not consider the overall composition of the grid. It only checks specific conditions about the first and last rows and columns, which do not cover all possible scenarios.

3. **Counterexample**: The provided counterexample demonstrates a scenario where the program incorrectly outputs "YES". In the grid:
   ```
   2 2
   WB
   BW
   ```
   The program would output "YES" because the first and last rows are not the same, but it is impossible to make all squares the same color using the described operations. The 'W' and 'B' are diagonally opposite, and there is no way to select two squares of the same color to change the entire grid to one color.

4. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach is to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If both 'W' and 'B' are present, it is impossible to make all squares the same color. If only one of them is present, then it is possible. This is because the operations described require selecting two squares of the same color to change the entire subrectangle to that color, and if both colors are present, there will always be a mix of 'W' and 'B' that cannot be resolved to a single color.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct because the provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The logic in the program is insufficient and makes incorrect assumptions.

**Final: False**
