### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The provided program uses a simplified logic to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color. It checks two specific conditions:
1. If all elements in the first row are the same and different from the last row.
2. If all elements in the first column are the same and different from the last column.

If either of these conditions is met, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

Let's analyze why this logic works:
- If all elements in the first row are the same and different from the last row, it means the first and last rows are uniform but different, making it impossible to turn them into the same color with the given operation.
- Similarly, if all elements in the first column are the same and different from the last column, it means the first and last columns are uniform but different, making it impossible to turn them into the same color with the given operation.

However, if neither of these conditions is met, it is possible to turn the entire grid into the same color. This is because the operation allows us to spread the color of any two squares of the same color across the entire grid, given that we can manipulate the grid in such a way that we can eventually make the entire grid uniform.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color based on the conditions outlined above. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
