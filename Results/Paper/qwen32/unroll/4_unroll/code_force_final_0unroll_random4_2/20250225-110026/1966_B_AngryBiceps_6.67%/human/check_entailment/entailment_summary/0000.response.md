### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided Python program and its logic in relation to the problem description.

The problem states that we can select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them that color. The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

The provided program checks two specific conditions:
1. If all elements in the first row are the same and different from all elements in the last row.
2. If all elements in the first column are the same and different from all elements in the last column.

If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

Let's consider why these conditions are relevant:
- If the first row is entirely one color (say 'W') and the last row is entirely a different color ('B'), it is impossible to make the entire grid one color using the described operation. This is because there is a clear separation between the two colors that cannot be bridged by any operation.
- Similarly, if the first column is entirely one color and the last column is entirely a different color, it is also impossible to make the entire grid one color using the described operation.

The program correctly identifies these scenarios as impossible and outputs "NO" for them. If neither of these scenarios is present, the program outputs "YES", which means it assumes that the grid can be made uniform through a series of operations.

The key point to note is that if the grid does not have these specific configurations, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because we can always find pairs of squares of the same color to expand the area of that color until the entire grid is covered.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the grid can be made uniform based on the given operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
