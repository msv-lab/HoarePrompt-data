Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (0-based) of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node in an undirected graph; `d` is a dictionary where keys are node indices from 0 to `n-1` and values are the shortest distances from node `a` to these nodes; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a dictionary or list that stores the previous node in the shortest path for each node; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**

In this output state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `b`, which is assigned the result of the function `func_1(d)`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
