The code `t = input()` changes the type of the variable `t` from an integer to a string, as `input()` reads input as a string. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged and still hold their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.**
