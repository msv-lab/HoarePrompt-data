Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input parameter `t`, which specifies the number of test cases. Instead of using `t` to determine the number of iterations, it always assumes there are 10 test cases. This will lead to incorrect behavior if the actual number of test cases is different from 10. The program should use the value of `t` to control the loop that reads the input. Additionally, the print statement should not include extra spaces.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))

func()
```

This version reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading two integers each time and printing their minimum and maximum values.
