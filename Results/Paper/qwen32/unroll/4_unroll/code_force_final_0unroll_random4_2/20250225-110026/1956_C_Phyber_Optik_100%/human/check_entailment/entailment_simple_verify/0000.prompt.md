You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Let's analyze the given program and the problem description:

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix using no more than 2n operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Assigning a row `i` with a permutation `p`.
2. Assigning a column `i` with a permutation `p`.

### Program Analysis:
The given program calculates the sum of the matrix and prints the operations incorrectly. Here are some issues:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. This formula does not correctly compute the maximum sum that can be achieved by filling the matrix with permutations.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints `n + n` operations, which is correct in terms of the number of operations, but the operations themselves are not optimal.
   - The operations are defined as `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))` and `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`. These operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum of the matrix, each row and each column should be filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The optimal way to do this is to fill the matrix with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] for each row and each column, which ensures that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and each column.

### Example:
For `n = 2`, the optimal matrix would be:
```
1 2
2 1
```
The sum of this matrix is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6.

However, the program outputs:
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This is incorrect because the matrix would be:
```
1 2
1 2
```
The sum of this matrix is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, which is not the maximum possible sum of 7.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix and does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is False.
