Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n x n matrix a filled with zeroes. The input consists of multiple test cases, with the first line containing the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other details about the test cases (such as the size of the matrices and their initial state) remain unchanged as the code snippet only reads the number of test cases.
