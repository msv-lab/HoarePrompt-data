Let's analyze the provided Python program in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The two types of operations allowed are:
1. Assigning a permutation to a row.
2. Assigning a permutation to a column.

The sum of all elements in the matrix can be maximized by ensuring that each number from 1 to n appears in each row and each column exactly once. This is because the sum of numbers from 1 to n is `n*(n+1)/2`, and if each number appears once per row and column, the total sum will be `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to achieve this by performing a specific sequence of operations. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the matrix using the formula:
     ```python
     sum = 1
     for i in range(2, n + 1):
         sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
   - This formula is actually equivalent to `sum = n * n * (n + 1) / 2`, which is the correct sum for an `n x n` matrix where each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and column.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program outputs `n + n` operations, which is `2n` as required.
   - The operations are:
     ```python
     for j in range(1, n + 1):
         print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
         print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - For each row and column, it assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - This means that the first row and first column will be set to `[1, 2, ..., n]`, the second row and second column will be set to `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and so on.

### Correctness:
While the program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix, the way it assigns permutations does not guarantee that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and column. The provided operations do not ensure that the matrix will be filled in such a way that all the numbers from 1 to n are used exactly once per row and column.

To achieve the correct result, we need to ensure that each row and each column contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. One way to do this is to use the identity permutation for each row and column, but the provided program does not do this correctly.

### Correct Implementation:
A correct approach would be to use the identity permutation for each row and column, ensuring that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and column. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly ensure that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and column, and thus, the operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix as intended.

**Correctness: False**
