Let's carefully analyze the program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Assigning a row \( i \) with a permutation \( p \).
2. Assigning a column \( i \) with a permutation \( p \).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the sum of the matrix and prints the operations as follows:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`.
   - This formula simplifies to `sum += i * i`, which is the sum of squares from 1 to \( n \). This is the correct formula for the maximum sum achievable by filling the matrix with permutations.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints `n + n` operations, which is correct in terms of the number of operations.
   - The operations are defined as `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))` and `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

Let's break down the operations:
- `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`: This assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the row `n - j + 1`.
- `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`: This assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the column `n - j + 1`.

### Example Analysis:
For `n = 2`, the operations would be:
1. `1 2 1 2`: Assigns `[1, 2]` to row 2.
2. `2 2 1 2`: Assigns `[1, 2]` to column 2.
3. `1 1 1 2`: Assigns `[1, 2]` to row 1.
4. `2 1 1 2`: Assigns `[1, 2]` to column 1.

The resulting matrix would be:
```
1 2
2 1
```
The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is the maximum possible sum for \( n = 2 \).

### General Case:
For any \( n \), the operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). This guarantees that the sum of the matrix is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times, which is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates operations that ensure each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
