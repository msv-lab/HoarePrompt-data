Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to ensure its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeros by performing a series of operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum in no more than \( 2n \) operations.

### Maximum Sum Calculation:
The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix in such a way that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears as many times as possible. The optimal strategy involves filling the matrix with the highest possible numbers in as many positions as possible.

For an \( n \times n \) matrix, the maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with numbers in a way that maximizes the contribution of each number. Specifically, the sum can be calculated as:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \]

### Operation Strategy:
To achieve this, we can use a strategy where we fill the rows and columns in a specific order. The provided solution suggests filling the rows and columns in reverse order, using permutations that place higher numbers in more positions.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the maximum sum correctly using the formula:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \]

The operations are structured as follows:
- For each row and column from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation followed by a Type 2 operation using the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

Let's break down the operations:
1. **Type 1 Operation**: Assigns the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] to a row.
2. **Type 2 Operation**: Assigns the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] to a column.

The provided solution performs these operations for each row and column, resulting in \( 2n \) operations.

### Correctness Check:
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation is correct. The formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \) correctly computes the maximum possible sum.
- **Operations**: The operations are intended to fill the matrix with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] for each row and column. However, the operations as described do not necessarily achieve the optimal configuration.

### Issue with the Operations:
The operations described in the code do not ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum. Specifically, the operations are:
- For each row and column from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation followed by a Type 2 operation using the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

This means that for each row and column, the matrix is filled with the same permutation [1, 2, ..., n]. This does not guarantee that the maximum sum is achieved because the highest numbers are not necessarily placed in the optimal positions.

### Correct Strategy:
To achieve the maximum sum, the strategy should be to place the highest numbers in as many positions as possible. One correct approach would be to fill the first row with [n, n-1, ..., 1], the second row with [n, n-1, ..., 1], and so on. This ensures that the highest numbers are placed in the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly achieve the maximum sum because the operations do not place the highest numbers in the optimal positions. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
