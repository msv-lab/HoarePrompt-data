You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, and `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`, then `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2` or neither.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from the input, checks certain conditions based on the characters in the string, and prints specific messages and substrings of `s` based on those conditions. The function always returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails for certain strings that require more than two partitions to ensure none of the substrings are palindromes. Let's analyze the code and identify the issue.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Handling of Single Character Strings and Uniform Strings**:
   - The code correctly identifies uniform strings (e.g., 'lllllllll') as not having a valid partition.
   - It also correctly handles strings that are not palindromes by partitioning them into a single substring.

2. **Handling of Strings Requiring More Than Two Partitions**:
   - The code only checks for partitions into one or two substrings.
   - For strings that require more than two partitions, the code does not correctly identify valid partitions. For example, consider the string "abacaba". The code might fail to partition it correctly into substrings that are not palindromes.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Let's consider the string "abacaba". The correct partition could be:
- "a", "b", "acaba"
- "a", "b", "aca", "ba"
- "ab", "a", "caba"
- "ab", "aca", "ba"

However, the provided code will fail to find such a partition and might incorrectly output "NO" or an incorrect partition.

### Correct Approach:
To handle all cases, the code should:
1. Check if the entire string is a palindrome.
2. If not, check for the smallest valid partition where each substring is not a palindrome.
3. For strings that are uniformly composed of the same character, output "NO".
4. For other strings, attempt to partition the string into the smallest number of substrings where each substring is not a palindrome.

### Revised Code Example:
Here is a revised version of the code that handles all cases correctly:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def partition_string(s):
    n = len(s)
    if n == 1:
        return "NO"
    
    # Try to find the smallest valid partition
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:j]) and not is_palindrome(s[j:]):
                return "YES", 3, s[:i], s[i:j], s[j:]
    
    # Try to find a valid partition with two parts
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
            return "YES", 2, s[:i], s[i:]
    
    # If no valid partition found, return "NO"
    return "NO"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    t = int(input[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input[idx]
        idx += 1
        result = partition_string(s)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result[0])
        if result[0] == "YES":
            print(result[1])
            print(" ".join(result[2:]))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised code ensures that all possible partitions are checked, and it correctly handles strings that require more than two partitions.
