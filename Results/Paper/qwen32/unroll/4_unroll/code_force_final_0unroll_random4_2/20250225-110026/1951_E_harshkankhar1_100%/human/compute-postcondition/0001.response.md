Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is -1.**

Explanation: The code assigns `n` the length of the input string `s`, but since `n` was already defined as the length of the input string `s` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `n`. The variable `x` is explicitly set to `-1`, which matches its initial state. Therefore, there are no changes to the state of the variables.
