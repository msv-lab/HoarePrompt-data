### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Task**: Partition a string into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome.
- **Input**: Multiple test cases with strings `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- **Output**: For each test case, print "YES" if there exists a valid partition and provide the partition, or "NO" if no such partition exists.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - Returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads a string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
   - Checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If not, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 1), and the string `s` itself.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first index `x` where `s[i]` is different from `s[0]`.
   - If no such index is found (`x` remains `-1`), it prints "NO".
   - If a valid `x` is found, it checks if the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 2), and the two parts of the string.
   - If the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is half the length of the string. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 2), and the two parts of the string.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Palindrome Check for All Substrings**:
   - The program only checks if the entire string and a substring starting from `x + 1` are palindromes. It does not ensure that the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` (or `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`) are not palindromes, which is crucial for the problem statement.
   - For example, in the case of the string "lllllllll", the program incorrectly identifies it as having a valid partition because it checks only the substring starting from `x + 1` and not the entire partition.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the string can be split into more than two parts to avoid palindromic substrings. For example, the string "uwuowouwu" can be split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", but the program only checks for two parts and might fail in some cases.

#### Verification Against Function Summary:
- The function summary indicates that `func_2` reads a string, checks certain conditions, and prints specific messages and substrings based on those conditions. However, the summary does not mention the thorough checking of all substrings in a partition to ensure none are palindromes.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases as it does not ensure that all substrings in the partition are non-palindromic and does not explore all possible partitions.

**Final: False**
