You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where `k` is greater than `2 * n` but less than `4 * n - 2`. The current implementation only handles three cases:

1. When `k == 1`, it correctly returns `1`.
2. When `k <= 2 * n`, it returns `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
3. When `k > 2 * n`, it returns `k // 2 + 1`.

However, the problem description specifies that there are `4 * n - 2` diagonals in total. Therefore, when `k` is between `2 * n` and `4 * n - 2`, the solution needs to be more nuanced. The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is in this range.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 5`. According to the problem statement, the minimum number of cells needed to color so that at least 5 diagonals have at least one colored cell is 3. However, the provided program will output `3 // 2 + 1 = 2`, which is incorrect.

Let's consider another example: `n = 4` and `k = 7`. The correct answer here is 4, but the program will output `7 // 2 + 1 = 4`, which happens to be correct in this case but is not a general solution.

To fix the program, we need to correctly account for the number of diagonals and the minimum number of cells required to color them. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
        elif k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            # For k > 2 * n, we need to consider the number of diagonals more carefully
            # The number of diagonals is 4 * n - 2
            # We need to color cells in such a way that we cover at least k diagonals
            # The formula for the minimum number of cells needed in this case is more complex
            # We need to color cells in a way that we cover the maximum number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells
            # The optimal strategy is to color cells in a pattern that covers the diagonals efficiently
            # For k > 2 * n, we can use the formula: math.ceil(k / 2) + (k - 2 * n) // 2
            print(math.ceil(k / 2) + (k - 2 * n) // 2)

func()
```

This corrected version handles all cases correctly. However, the original program does not, so the correctness is `False`.
