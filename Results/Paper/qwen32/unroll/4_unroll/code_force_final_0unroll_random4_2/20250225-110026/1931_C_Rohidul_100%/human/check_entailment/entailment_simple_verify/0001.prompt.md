You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: - The output state after all test cases are processed will be a series of printed values of `ans` for each test case.
    #   - The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` will be in their final state after the last iteration of the loop, but since the problem asks for the output state in terms of the printed results, we focus on the printed values.
    #
    #Given the format requirement, the output state can be described as the sequence of printed `ans` values for each test case. Since the exact values depend on the input, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal by applying a single operation at most once. The operation allows selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a specified value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the input for each test case.
2. Identifying the longest prefix and suffix of the array that contains the same element.
3. Calculating the minimum cost based on the length of the array and the lengths of these prefix and suffix.

#### Key Points:
- `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.
- `st` and `end` are counters for the lengths of the prefix and suffix, respectively.
- The program then calculates the minimum cost to make the array uniform by considering the longest prefix and suffix of the same elements and calculates the cost based on the remaining elements that need to be changed.

#### Logic Flaws:
- The program does not consider all possible cases for making the entire array uniform with a single operation.
- The logic assumes that the optimal solution is always to change the middle part of the array by making it equal to either the prefix or the suffix. However, this is not always true.
- For example, if the array has a repeating pattern in the middle that is different from both the prefix and suffix, the program might not find the optimal solution.
- The program does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves changing a segment that is not the prefix or suffix.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]`. The program will identify the prefix `[1]` and the suffix `[1]` and calculate the cost as `6 - max(1, 1) = 5`. However, the optimal solution is to change the middle part `[2, 2, 3, 3]` to `1`, which costs `4` burles.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not handle all cases correctly and does not always find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
