Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal by applying a single operation at most once. The operation allows selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a specified value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the input for each test case.
2. Identifying the longest prefix and suffix of the array that contains the same element.
3. Calculating the minimum cost based on the length of the array and the lengths of these prefix and suffix.

#### Key Points:
- `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.
- `st` and `end` are counters for the lengths of the prefix and suffix, respectively.
- The program then calculates the minimum cost to make the array uniform by considering the longest prefix and suffix of the same elements and calculates the cost based on the remaining elements that need to be changed.

#### Logic Flaws:
- The program does not consider all possible cases for making the entire array uniform with a single operation.
- The logic assumes that the optimal solution is always to change the middle part of the array by making it equal to either the prefix or the suffix. However, this is not always true.
- For example, if the array has a repeating pattern in the middle that is different from both the prefix and suffix, the program might not find the optimal solution.
- The program does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves changing a segment that is not the prefix or suffix.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]`. The program will identify the prefix `[1]` and the suffix `[1]` and calculate the cost as `6 - max(1, 1) = 5`. However, the optimal solution is to change the middle part `[2, 2, 3, 3]` to `1`, which costs `4` burles.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not handle all cases correctly and does not always find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **False**
