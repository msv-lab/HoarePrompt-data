To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the role of the variable `k`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- **t test cases**: This indicates that there are multiple test cases, each with the same set of variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`.
- **n, m, a, b**: These variables are unchanged across test cases. However, their specific values are not provided.
- **k**: This is described as the count of matched characters.
- **j**: This is described as the stopping index in `b`.

Given this information, we can infer that `k` is a variable that holds the count of matched characters between some unspecified parts of `a` and `b` up to the index `j`.

### Output Explanation:
The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the count of matched characters as described in the initial state.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and the specific logic for determining `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of what `k` represents.

Output: **k (where k is the count of matched characters between some parts of a and b up to the index j)**
