You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively, followed by the binary string a of length n, and the binary string b of length m. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: t test cases with n, m, a, b unchanged, k as the count of matched characters, and j as the stopping index in b.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the count of matched characters between some parts of a and b up to the index j)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b`. For each test case, it counts the maximum number of characters that can be matched sequentially from `a` in `b` and prints this count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
You need to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

### Program:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to traverse string `b`.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The loop runs over each character in string `a` (from index 0 to \( n-1 \)).

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner `while` loop increments `j` until it finds a character in `b` that matches the current character in `a` or until `j` reaches the end of `b`.

4. **Character Matching**:
   - If a match is found (`j < m`), `k` is incremented by 1 to indicate that one more character from `a` has been matched as a subsequence in `b`.
   - `j` is then incremented by 1 to move to the next character in `b`.
   - If no match is found (`j >= m`), the loop breaks, as no more characters from `a` can be matched as a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `k`, which is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- It handles all edge cases, such as:
  - When `a` is an empty string or `b` is an empty string.
  - When `a` is a subsequence of `b` in its entirety.
  - When `a` has characters that do not appear in `b`.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - \( n = 5, m = 4 \)
   - \( a = "10011" \)
   - \( b = "1110" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"10"`, so the output is `2`.

2. **Second Example**:
   - \( n = 3, m = 3 \)
   - \( a = "100" \)
   - \( b = "110" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"10"`, so the output is `2`.

3. **Third Example**:
   - \( n = 1, m = 3 \)
   - \( a = "1" \)
   - \( b = "111" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"1"`, so the output is `1`.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - \( n = 4, m = 4 \)
   - \( a = "1011" \)
   - \( b = "1111" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"101"`, so the output is `3`.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - \( n = 3, m = 5 \)
   - \( a = "100" \)
   - \( b = "11010" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"100"`, so the output is `3`.

6. **Sixth Example**:
   - \( n = 3, m = 1 \)
   - \( a = "100" \)
   - \( b = "0" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `""`, so the output is `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases. There are no known cases where the program does not produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**.
