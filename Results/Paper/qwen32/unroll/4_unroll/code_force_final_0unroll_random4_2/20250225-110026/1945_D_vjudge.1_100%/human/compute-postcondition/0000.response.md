The code snippet creates a new list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of the corresponding elements `a[i]` and `b[i]` from the lists `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, and `c` is a list of n integers where each element c_i is the minimum of a_i and b_i.**
