Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. The current implementation assumes that the cost to move to position `i` is simply `a[i]` plus the sum of the minimum costs of all positions after `i`. However, this approach does not account for the fact that Kirill might need to pay `b[k]` coins to all people `k` between `i` and the position Kirill is moving to, which is not correctly handled.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(n, m, a, b):
    # We use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to move to each position
    heap = []
    total_cost = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Add the cost to bribe the person at position i to the heap
        heapq.heappush(heap, (a[i], i))
        # Add the cost b[i] to the total cost
        total_cost += b[i]
        # If the heap size exceeds m-1, we need to remove the most expensive bribe
        if len(heap) > m-1:
            cost, idx = heapq.heappop(heap)
            total_cost -= b[idx]
    # The answer is the minimum cost to bribe someone plus the total cost of b's
    ans = heap[0][0] + total_cost if heap else total_cost
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, m, a, b)
```

In this corrected version, we use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum costs of bribes for the first `m-1` positions. We also keep a running total of the `b` costs. If the heap size exceeds `m-1`, we remove the most expensive bribe from the heap and adjust the total cost accordingly. The final answer is the minimum cost to bribe someone plus the total cost of `b` values.
