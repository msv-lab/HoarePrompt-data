Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets given the constraints.

Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Sorting the prices**: The code sorts the prices in ascending order. This is a good start because buying tickets on the cheapest days first is generally a good strategy.

2. **Calculating the number of days to buy tickets**: The code calculates the number of days `q` to buy tickets by taking the ceiling of `k / m`. This part seems correct.

3. **Handling the case where `n * m == k`**: The code calculates the cost correctly in this case. However, it assumes that the cheapest `q` days are sufficient to buy `k` tickets, which may not always be the case due to the price increase mechanism.

4. **Handling the case where `n * m != k`**: The code attempts to handle the remaining tickets after buying `m` tickets on the cheapest `q-1` days. However, the logic here is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the cost for the remaining tickets and does not account for the price increase correctly.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 7
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
18
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Buy 2 tickets on day 1 (cost = 2 * 1 = 2). Prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Buy 2 tickets on day 2 (cost = 2 * 3 = 6). Prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
- Buy 2 tickets on day 3 (cost = 2 * 5 = 10). Prices become [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
- Buy 1 ticket on day 4 (cost = 7). Total cost = 2 + 6 + 10 + 7 = 25.

However, the optimal strategy is:
- Buy 2 tickets on day 1 (cost = 2 * 1 = 2). Prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Buy 2 tickets on day 2 (cost = 2 * 3 = 6). Prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
- Buy 2 tickets on day 3 (cost = 2 * 5 = 10). Prices become [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
- Buy 1 ticket on day 4 (cost = 7). Total cost = 2 + 6 + 10 + 7 = 25.

The code does not correctly account for the price increase and the optimal number of tickets to buy on each day. Therefore, the code is incorrect for this case and possibly others.

Thus, the correctness is **False**.
