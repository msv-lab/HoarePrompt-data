### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

1. **Reading Inputs:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of prices `a` for each day.

2. **Constraints and Adjustments:**
   - The program sets `m` to be the minimum of `m` and `k` because it's not possible to buy more tickets in a single day than the total number of tickets needed.
   - It sorts the list of prices `a` to start with the cheapest days.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q`, the number of days required to buy `k` tickets, by dividing `k` by `m` and rounding up.
   - It selects the first `q` days with the lowest prices.

4. **Calculating Cost:**
   - If `n * m` (total tickets bought if `m` tickets are bought each day for `n` days) equals `k`, the cost is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m` is greater than `k`, it means not all days will need to buy `m` tickets. The program calculates the cost differently:
     - It pops the most expensive day from the selected days.
     - It calculates the number of tickets `mu` to buy on the last day.
     - It calculates the cost for the remaining days and adds the cost of tickets on the last day.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of Remaining Tickets:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the cost when `n * m` is greater than `k`. Specifically, the cost calculation for the remaining tickets on the last day is incorrect. The formula `n * m * mu` is incorrect because it doesn't account for the increasing prices correctly.

2. **General Logic Flaw:**
   - The program's logic for handling the remaining tickets doesn't correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. It should iteratively buy tickets while adjusting the prices accordingly.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

**Correctness: False**
