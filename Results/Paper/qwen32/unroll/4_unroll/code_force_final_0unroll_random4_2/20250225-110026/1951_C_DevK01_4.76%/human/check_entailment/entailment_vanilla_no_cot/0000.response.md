Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are in the logic used to determine the minimum cost to purchase the tickets. Here are some key points that indicate the program's incorrectness:

1. **Sorting the Prices:** The program sorts the prices, which is not necessarily the best strategy. The optimal strategy involves considering the prices in the order they are given, as the price increase affects subsequent days.

2. **Calculating the Cost:** The cost calculation in the program does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to the tickets purchased on previous days. The program seems to assume a uniform distribution of tickets over the days, which is not optimal.

3. **Handling the Remaining Tickets:** The program incorrectly handles the case where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is not a multiple of `m`. The logic for the remaining tickets (`mu`) is flawed and does not correctly calculate the additional cost.

4. **General Strategy:** The program does not use a greedy or dynamic programming approach that would be more suitable for solving this type of problem. A correct approach would involve a greedy strategy where you always buy the maximum number of tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the price increases.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day.
- Keep track of the cumulative price increase and adjust the prices accordingly.
- Ensure that the number of tickets bought does not exceed the maximum allowed per day (`m`).

Here is a corrected version of the program using a greedy approach:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Min-heap to store the prices
        min_heap = []
        for price in prices:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, price)
        
        total_cost = 0
        cumulative_increase = 0
        
        while k > 0:
            # Get the minimum price ticket
            price = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            # Adjust the price by the cumulative increase
            adjusted_price = price + cumulative_increase
            
            # Buy as many tickets as possible on this day
            tickets_to_buy = min(k, m)
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * adjusted_price
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            
            # Increase the cumulative price for future days
            cumulative_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected program should handle the problem requirements correctly and produce the minimum cost to purchase the required number of tickets.
