Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This helps in easily deciding which elements to remove (smallest ones) and which to negate (smallest ones after removal).

2. **Handling Special Case**: The function `func_2` has a hardcoded condition to return 0 if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. This condition doesn't align with the problem's logic and seems to be a mistake or an incorrect assumption about a specific scenario. This special case should be removed.

3. **Calculating Possible Sums**: The function calculates the sum of the array after possible removals and negations. It does so by:
   - First calculating the sum of all elements (`s`).
   - Then calculating the sum of the last `negatives` elements (`n`).
   - The initial possible sum (`pos[0]`) is calculated as `s - 2 * n`.
   - Iteratively, it removes the last element from the sum (`s`), adjusts the sum of the last `negatives` elements (`n`), and calculates the new possible sum. This is done for each possible number of removals from 1 to `removals`.
   
4. **Returning the Maximum Sum**: The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the best possible sum after both players have made their optimal moves.

The hardcoded condition for `removals` and `negatives` being 6 and 3, respectively, is not justified by the problem statement and leads to incorrect results for those cases. This condition should be removed or corrected.

Given the hardcoded condition, the program is not correct for all test cases, and therefore the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
