Reasoning:  
The provided program contains a significant logical flaw in the function `func_2`. The function is supposed to determine the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob play their moves optimally. However, the current implementation incorrectly includes a hardcoded condition that returns 0 when `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, which is not a general solution for the problem.

The main logic of the function `func_2` attempts to calculate the maximum possible sum after both players have made their moves. It does this by considering different scenarios where Alice removes a different number of elements (from 0 to `removals`) and then calculates the effect of Bob flipping up to `negatives` elements to negative. However, the hardcoded condition will override this logic for specific cases, leading to incorrect results.

For example, in the fifth test case from the problem statement, the correct output should be -5, but the hardcoded condition would return 0, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the presence of the hardcoded condition that does not align with the general logic of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
