The code snippet calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements of the list `elements` and assigns this sum to the variable `n`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. It is not the case that `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3; `pos` is an empty list; `s` is the sum of `elements`; `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**
