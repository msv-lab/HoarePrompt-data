### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x`, which represent the number of players, the number of throws, and the initial player with the ball, respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, where each line contains an integer `r` (the distance of the throw) and a character `c` (the direction of the throw).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the direction `c` and the distance `r`.
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the player who would receive the ball if the throw were clockwise.
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the player who would receive the ball if the throw were counterclockwise.
   - The modulo operation (`% n`) ensures that the player numbers wrap around the circle correctly.
   - If `0` is in the set `ans` (which can happen due to the modulo operation), it is replaced with `n` to ensure player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball after all throws.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the direction `c` is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both possible directions.
   - It correctly wraps around the circle using the modulo operation.
   - It ensures that player numbers are always in the range `[1, n]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all possible cases, including unknown directions, and ensures that the output is correct and formatted as required.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
