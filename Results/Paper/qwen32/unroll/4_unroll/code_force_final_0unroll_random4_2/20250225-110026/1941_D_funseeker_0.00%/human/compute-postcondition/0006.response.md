The code snippet adds the value `n` to the set `ans`. Given that `0` is no longer an element in `ans` and `ans` is a set of integers, after adding `n`, the set `ans` will now include `n` as well as all the integers it previously contained. 

Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers that have been transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations, and `0` is no longer an element in `ans`, and `n` is an element in `ans`.**
