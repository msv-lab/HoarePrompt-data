The function performs a series of transformations on an initial set containing a single integer `x` by adding or subtracting a value `r` modulo `n` based on the character `c`. After `m` iterations, it adjusts the set by replacing `0` with `n` if `0` is present. The function then outputs the number of elements in the final set and the elements themselves, ensuring `0` is not present and `n` is included if necessary.
