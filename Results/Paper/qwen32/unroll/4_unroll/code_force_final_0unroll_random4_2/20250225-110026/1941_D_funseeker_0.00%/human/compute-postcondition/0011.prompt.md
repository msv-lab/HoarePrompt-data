You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n. r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and c is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` is a set of integers that have been transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `ans` is a set of integers that have been transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations. If `0` was an element in `ans` before the if statement, it is no longer an element in `ans` and `n` is an element in `ans`. If `0` was not an element in `ans`, no changes are made to `ans`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set `ans` after the described transformations)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: n [other elements of ans excluding 0] (where n is definitely in ans and 0 is not in ans if it was originally present)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers representing dimensions, `x` is an integer representing a position, `r` is an integer representing another position constraint, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'. The function returns a value based on these inputs, with specific cases handling different values of `c`. If `c` is '0', it returns one result; if `c` is '1', it returns another result; and if `c` is '?', it returns a third result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
