The given code snippet assigns the value of `x` to a new variable `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are determined by the function `func_3()`, and `r` and `c` retain their initial conditions. Since the code only modifies `ans` and does not affect `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, or `c`, we can directly state the output state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'. `ans` is assigned the value of `x`.**
