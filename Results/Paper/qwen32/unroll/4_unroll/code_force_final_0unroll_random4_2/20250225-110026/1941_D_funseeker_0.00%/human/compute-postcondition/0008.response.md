To determine the output of the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **`ans` is a set of integers**: This means `ans` contains unique integer values.
2. **Transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n`**: The elements in `ans` have been modified through some operations that involve addition, subtraction, and taking the result modulo `n`.
3. **Based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations**: The transformations on `ans` are influenced by the values of `r` and `c` which are obtained from a function `func_1()` called `m` times.
4. **If `0` was an element in `ans` before the if statement**: This condition checks whether `0` was part of the set `ans` before a specific if statement was executed.
5. **It is no longer an element in `ans` and `n` is an element in `ans`**: If `0` was in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.
6. **If `0` was not an element in `ans`**: No changes are made to `ans`.

Given these conditions, the length of `ans` after the transformation and the if statement can be described as follows:

- If `0` was originally in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added. This means the size of `ans` does not change because one element is removed and another is added.
- If `0` was not originally in `ans`, no changes are made to `ans`, so its size remains the same.

Thus, the length of `ans` after these operations is the same as it was before the if statement, except that if `0` was present, it is replaced by `n`, which does not alter the count of elements.

Therefore, the output of `print(len(ans))` will be the number of elements in `ans` after the described transformations.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set `ans` after the described transformations)**
