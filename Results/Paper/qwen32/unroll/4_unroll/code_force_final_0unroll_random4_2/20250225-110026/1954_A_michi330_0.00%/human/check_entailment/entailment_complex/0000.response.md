### Reasoning:
To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, we need to analyze the constraints and the given conditions:

1. **If `n <= k`**: This means Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon, making it possible for him to paint all parts the same color. Hence, the answer should be "NO".

2. **If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**: This condition checks if Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color even if Alice tries to distribute the colors as evenly as possible. `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that would have the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible. If Bob can repaint `k` parts and `k` is greater than or equal to the difference between the total number of parts and this minimum, then Bob can still make all parts the same color. Hence, the answer should be "NO".

3. **Otherwise**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color. Hence, the answer should be "YES".

The program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and checks the conditions mentioned above to determine the output.
