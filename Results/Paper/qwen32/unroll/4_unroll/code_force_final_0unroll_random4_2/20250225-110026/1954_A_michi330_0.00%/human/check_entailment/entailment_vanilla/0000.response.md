Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice wants to paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most `k` parts.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The ribbon has `n` parts.
   - Alice can use `m` different colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts.
3. **Key Insight**:
   - If Alice can distribute the colors such that no single color is used for more than `n - k` parts, Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color regardless of how Alice paints them.
   - If `n - ceil(n / m) < k`, Alice cannot distribute the colors such that the most frequent color is used for no more than `n - k` parts, because even if she distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint the necessary parts to make all parts the same color.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses the following logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It checks two conditions:
  1. If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint all parts.
  2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot prevent Bob from repainting all parts to the same color.
  3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Verification:
- **First Condition (`n <= k`)**:
  - Correctly handles the scenario where Bob can repaint all parts.
- **Second Condition (`n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`)**:
  - Correctly handles the scenario where Alice cannot prevent Bob from repainting all parts to the same color even with optimal distribution.
- **Otherwise (`YES`)**:
  - Correctly handles the scenario where Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
