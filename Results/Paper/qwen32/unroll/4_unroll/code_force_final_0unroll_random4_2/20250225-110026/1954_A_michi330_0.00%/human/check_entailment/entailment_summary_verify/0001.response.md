### Reasoning:

Let's delve deeper into the logic of the provided program and verify it against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Objective Recap**:
   - Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most `k` parts.
   - The ribbon has `n` parts, Alice can use `m` colors, and Bob can repaint at most `k` parts.

2. **Key Insight Recap**:
   - If Alice can distribute the colors such that no single color is used for more than `n - k` parts, Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color regardless of how Alice paints them.
   - If `n - ceil(n / m) < k`, Alice cannot distribute the colors such that the most frequent color is used for no more than `n - k` parts, because even if she distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint the necessary parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     1. If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint all parts.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot prevent Bob from repainting all parts to the same color.
     3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Verification**:
   - **First Condition (`n <= k`)**:
     - This condition is correct. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.
   - **Second Condition (`n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`)**:
     - This condition is also correct. If the number of parts that cannot be avoided to be the most frequent color (i.e., `n - ceil(n / m)`) is less than `k`, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
   - **Otherwise (`YES`)**:
     - This condition is correct as well. If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most `k` parts.

5. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the logic of the program. It correctly identifies the conditions under which Alice can or cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem analysis and the function summary. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
