Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50), where `n` is the number of parts of the ribbon, `m` is the number of colors available, and `k` is the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint. For each test case, the function returns the result based on these parameters.**
