To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value obtained from `int(input())`.

Given the context, the loop will execute if the value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `n` (the length of the array) is provided as input and is guaranteed to be between 2 and 100, the loop will always execute as long as the input is correctly provided according to the problem statement.

However, to adhere strictly to the task requirements and ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input value is correctly set before the loop starts. Since `n` is already described as being between 2 and 100, we don't need to adjust `n` itself, but we need to ensure that the input process provides a value that will allow the loop to start.

State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array. This is followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The total number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 500. The input is such that `n` is always between 2 and 100, ensuring the loop will execute.**

Since the loop variable `_` is not used and the loop will execute as long as `n` is correctly provided, we don't need to adjust any other variables in the loop head. The state before the loop starts is already sufficient to ensure the loop can execute given the problem constraints.

Final State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array. This is followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The total number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 500.**
