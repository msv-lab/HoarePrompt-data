You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The total number of test cases, t, is between 1 and 500.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: For each test case, the output will be a line containing the elements of the array sorted in ascending order, with each element separated by a space. The total number of test cases, t, and the initial state of other variables not affected by the loop remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers in ascending order and prints the sorted list with elements separated by spaces. The function does not modify the input values or maintain any state between test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally. The optimal arrangement to maximize this beauty is to sort the array in ascending order. However, the program provided sorts the array and then prints the sorted array elements, separated by spaces, without calculating the beauty.

To solve the problem correctly, after sorting the array, we need to compute the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Here’s what the correct program should do:
1. For each test case, read the integer n.
2. Read the array of n integers.
3. Sort the array.
4. Compute the beauty by summing up (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.
5. Print the beauty for each test case.

The given program does not perform the last two steps and instead prints the sorted array, which is not the required output.

Correctness: **False**
