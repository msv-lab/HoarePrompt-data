You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it determines the maximum possible score that can be achieved under certain conditions and prints that value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Total Points Constraint:**
   - The total points across all three players must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0, 1-1, or 0-2).

2. **Maximizing Draws:**
   - Draws contribute 1 point each to both players involved in the draw. 
   - To maximize the number of draws, we need to minimize the number of games that result in a 2-0 outcome since those contribute to the total points without adding to the draw count.
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated based on the scores of the players, considering that the scores are sorted in non-decreasing order (p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3).

3. **Invalid Score Combinations:**
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve those scores, so the program should return -1.
   - If the score of the player with the highest points (p3) is too high relative to the other two players (p1 and p2), it's also impossible to achieve those scores, and the program should return -1.

### Program Logic Analysis:

- **Total Points Check:**
  - The program first checks if the sum of the scores (p1 + p2 + p3) is odd. If so, it immediately prints -1, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

- **Max Draw Calculation:**
  - If p3 ≥ p1 + p2, then the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2. This is because the remaining points (p3 - (p1 + p2)) must all come from 2-0 games, and the maximum number of draws is limited by the smaller of p1 and p2.
  - If p3 < p1 + p2, the program enters a loop to find the maximum possible number of draws. It adjusts the number of 1-1 and 2-0 games to find a valid configuration. The loop iterates over possible values of x (number of 2-0 games involving p1) and y (number of 2-0 games involving p2) to find a valid configuration that satisfies the score constraints.
  - If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it defaults to printing p3, which might not be correct in all cases.

### Potential Issues:

- The loop logic might not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the loop might not always find the maximum number of draws, and the default case of printing p3 is not always correct.
- The program does not handle the case where the scores are impossible to achieve due to the constraints of the game (e.g., p1 + p2 < p3 but the scores cannot be achieved with a valid combination of games).

### Conclusion:

The provided program has a few issues that could lead to incorrect results in some cases, particularly in the loop logic and the default case handling. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
