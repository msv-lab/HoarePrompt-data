### Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. The goal is to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores, or to determine if the scores are invalid.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Check the sum of scores**: 
   - If the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games because each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for the winner and 0 for the loser, or 1 for each in case of a draw). Therefore, if the sum of scores is odd, the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Check if the highest score is too high**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), it implies that one player could have won all the games against the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the third player could have drawn all their games with the other two players.

3. **Determine the maximum number of draws**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It uses two variables `x` and `y` to represent the number of games where the player with `p1` and `p2` lost, respectively. The loop iterates while `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it means the scores can be achieved with `p1 - x + p3` draws. The loop breaks after printing the result.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness:
The logic in the program correctly handles the conditions mentioned in the problem description and accurately calculates the maximum number of draws or determines if the scores are invalid.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
