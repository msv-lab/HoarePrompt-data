To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code within the loop. The loop processes each test case individually, and the output of each test case is printed directly, not stored. Therefore, after all iterations, the state of the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `t` will be the same as they were at the end of the last iteration, but the outputs for each test case will have been printed.

Since the output of each test case is printed immediately and does not affect the state of the variables for the subsequent iterations, the final state of the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `t` will be the values from the last test case processed.

However, since the problem asks for the output state in a format similar to the initial execution state, we will describe the state of the variables as they would be at the end of the loop, which is the state of the last test case.

Let's assume the last test case has the values `p1_last`, `p2_last`, and `p3_last`. The number of test cases `t` will be 0 after all iterations are complete because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly by iterating.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **p1_last p2_last p3_last 0**.

Since the specific values of `p1_last`, `p2_last`, and `p3_last` depend on the input, we cannot provide exact numerical values without the input data. However, the format will be as described.

If we hypothetically assume the last test case was `10 20 30`, the output state would be:

Output State: **10 20 30 0**.

But without specific input data, the general format is:

Output State: **p1_last p2_last p3_last 0**.
