### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and its logic to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total points from games must be even (since each game awards either 2 points in total or 2 points split as 1+1 in case of a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program proceeds to calculate the maximum number of draws.
   - It checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If true, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest score can be achieved by the player having `p3` winning all games against the players with `p1` and `p2`, and `p1` and `p2` could have drawn all their games among themselves, contributing `p1 + p2` draws.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively. The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it increments `x` and decrements `y`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`) by printing `0`.
   - It correctly identifies impossible score distributions (e.g., `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 10`) by printing `-1`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement. It ensures that the sum of scores is even and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints. The logic and edge cases are handled appropriately.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
