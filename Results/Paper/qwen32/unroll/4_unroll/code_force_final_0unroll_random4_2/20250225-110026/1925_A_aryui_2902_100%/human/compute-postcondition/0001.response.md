Output State: **The function `func_1` is called without any arguments. The input is read from standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the current line of input. `s` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**

In simple terms, the variable `s` has been assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) are still described as per the initial state, with `t` representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `k` being integers read from each subsequent line of input.
