Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`) remain as described in the initial state since they have not been modified by the code snippet.
