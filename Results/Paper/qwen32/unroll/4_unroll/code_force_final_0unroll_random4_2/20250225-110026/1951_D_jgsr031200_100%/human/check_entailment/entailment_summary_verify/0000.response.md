### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem statement, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
Bob needs to set up stalls with different prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys from stalls in order, maximizing the number of jewels per stall until she can no longer afford to buy more. The goal is to ensure that she buys exactly `k` jewels and that the number of stalls is at most 60.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1` that takes `n` and `k` as inputs. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up one stall with price 1, and returns.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" and returns.

2. **Costs Calculation**:
   - It initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` and `h` (the total number of jewels bought).
   - If the total number of jewels bought `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the costs.

#### Issues with the Provided Code:
1. **Limited Number of Stalls**: The code only considers two stalls, which is insufficient for many cases, especially when `k` is large.
2. **Incorrect Cost Distribution**: The costs are not strategically set to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, in the test case `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the code sets up stalls with prices 248 and 1, which does not result in Alice buying exactly 8 jewels.
3. **General Strategy**: The code does not implement a general strategy to set up the stalls correctly. It needs to consider more than just two stalls and set prices in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to strategically set up the stalls. One effective approach is to use a binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their prices. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up stalls with prices that correspond to the binary digits of `k`.

Here's a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        return
    if n == k:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    
    stalls = []
    remaining = k
    current_price = 1
    
    while remaining > 0:
        if remaining & 1:
            stalls.append(current_price)
        remaining >>= 1
        current_price *= 2
    
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

#### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly handle all cases and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final: **False** (The original assessment was correct, so the program is indeed incorrect.)

However, to match the format of the question, we should state the final evaluation based on the original assessment being accurate:
