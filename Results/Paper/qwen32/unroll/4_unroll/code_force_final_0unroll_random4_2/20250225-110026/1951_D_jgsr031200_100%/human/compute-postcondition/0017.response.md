Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is 0.
2. `k` is unchanged (its value is not specified, so we'll treat it as a variable `k`).
3. `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Given `n` is 0, `costs` becomes `[-k + 1, 1]`.
4. `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n`. Since `n` is 0, `h` simplifies to `0 // (-k + 1) + 0`, which is `0` (assuming `-k + 1` is not zero).
5. It is also mentioned that `h` is not less than `k`, but since `h` is 0, this condition implies that `k` must be 0 or a negative number. However, the exact value of `k` is not crucial for the `print` statement in this code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is hardcoded to print `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
