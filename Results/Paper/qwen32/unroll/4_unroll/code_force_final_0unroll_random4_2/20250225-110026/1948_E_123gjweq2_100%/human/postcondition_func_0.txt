The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is in the range [2, 40] and `k` is in the range [1, 2n]. It calculates the ceiling of `n / k` and creates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each of length `n`. The list `arr` is filled with segments of length `k` (or less for the last segment) with values incrementing from 1 up to the calculated ceiling. The list `cliquess` is similarly filled, with each number from 1 to the ceiling appearing `k` times, except possibly the last number which may appear fewer times if `n % k` is not zero. The function prints the contents of `arr`, the calculated ceiling, and the contents of `cliquess`.
