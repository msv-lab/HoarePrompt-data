You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` modifies two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, for a specified range of indices from `left` to `right`. It sets the first half of the range in `arr` to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. It also assigns the `clique` value to all entries in the `cliquess` array for the same range.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. These variables should be passed as parameters to the functions to ensure they are correctly initialized and used within the scope of each test case.

2. **Initialization of Arrays**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized with zeros. However, the problem requires `arr` to contain distinct integers from 1 to n. The program does not ensure this.

3. **Logic for Array Construction**: The logic in `make_array` for filling `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the values in `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to n and that the conditions for edge creation are met.

4. **Edge Condition Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the edge conditions for the graph construction, specifically the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the results directly within the function, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:

Let's consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`.

- The program initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
- The function `make_array` attempts to fill these arrays but does not ensure that `arr` contains distinct integers from 1 to 5.
- The logic for partitioning the graph into cliques based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not correctly implemented.

For `n = 5` and `k = 4`, a correct solution could be:
- `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `cliques = 1`
- `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

This is because with `arr` being a simple sequence from 1 to 5, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices, and thus, all vertices can be in the same clique.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails to produce the correct output for at least one test case. Therefore, it is incorrect.
