Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its behavior based on the problem description:

1. The main function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`. This is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required to partition the graph into cliques where each pair of vertices (i, j) has an edge if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. The calculation of the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` is a heuristic and does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques.

2. The function `make_array` fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays. `arr` is supposed to contain a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, and `cliquess` should indicate the clique each vertex belongs to. However, the way `make_array` fills these arrays does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem statement. Specifically:
   - `make_array` assigns values to `arr` in a way that the first half of the range is filled with increasing values and the second half with decreasing values. This does not necessarily satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs (i, j) in the same clique.
   - The function `make_array` assigns the same clique number to all vertices in the range from `left` to `right`, but this does not guarantee that the condition for the edges is satisfied.

3. The output of the program is based on the values in `arr` and `cliquess`, which are not guaranteed to produce a valid partition of the graph into the minimum number of cliques as per the problem description.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The heuristic used to determine the number of cliques and the way the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are filled do not guarantee a correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
