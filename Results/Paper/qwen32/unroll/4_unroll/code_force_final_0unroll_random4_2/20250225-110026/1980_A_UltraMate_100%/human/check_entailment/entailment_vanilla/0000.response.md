Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of problems in the bank.
     - `m`: Number of rounds.
     - `s`: A string of `n` characters representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold `m` rounds, where each round must have one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the string `s`.
2. **Counting Problems**:
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of problems Vlad needs to add.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' (stored in `p`).
     - If a particular difficulty level `i` is not present in the `Counter` (`hmp`), it means Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level, so it adds `m` to `ans`.
     - If a particular difficulty level `i` is present but its count is less than `m`, it means Vlad needs `m - hmp[i]` more problems of that difficulty level, so it adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.
4. **Output**:
   - It prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly counts the number of problems for each difficulty level.
- It correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level that is either missing or insufficient.
- It handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
