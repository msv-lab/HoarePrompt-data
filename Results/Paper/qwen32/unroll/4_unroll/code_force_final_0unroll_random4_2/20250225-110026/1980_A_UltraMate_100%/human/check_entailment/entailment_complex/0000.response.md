### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify it against the example provided:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` that represents the difficulties of the current set of problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G':
     - If a difficulty level is not present in the current set of problems (`if i not in hmp`), it means `m` new problems of that difficulty are needed.
     - If a difficulty level is present but there are fewer than `m` problems of that difficulty (`if hmp[i] < m`), it calculates the number of additional problems needed as `m - hmp[i]`.

4. **Summing Up**:
   - The program accumulates the total number of additional problems needed in the variable `ans` and prints it for each test case.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case** (`n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`):
  - The difficulties present are: B (3), G (2), E (2), C (1), D (2).
  - Missing difficulties: A, F.
  - Additional problems needed: 1 (for A) + 1 (for F) = 2.
  
- **Second Test Case** (`n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`):
  - The difficulties present are: B (3), G (2), E (2), C (1), D (2).
  - Missing difficulties: A, F.
  - Additional problems needed: 2 (for A) + 2 (for F) + (2 - 1) (for C) + (2 - 2) (for B, E, D) = 5.

- **Third Test Case** (`n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BBCDEFFGG'`):
  - The difficulties present are: B (2), C (1), D (1), E (1), F (2), G (2).
  - Missing difficulties: A.
  - Additional problems needed: 1 (for A) + (1 - 1) (for B, C, D, E, F, G) = 1.

The program correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each test case as per the example provided.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

**Correctness: True**
