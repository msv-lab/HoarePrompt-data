You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of problems and their difficulties, and the number of upcoming rounds. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' is represented in at least the number of upcoming rounds specified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. He has `n` problems with given difficulty levels. He needs to determine the minimum number of additional problems he needs to create to ensure each of the `m` rounds has one problem of each difficulty level.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given problems. It then calculates the number of additional problems needed by checking if the count of each level is less than `m`. If a level is missing entirely, it assumes `m` additional problems are needed for that level.

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads the string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Difficulty Levels**:
   - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
     - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (`hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds will need a new problem of that level.
     - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the calculated `ans`.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples and consider edge cases.

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
- **Output**: `2`
- **Explanation**: Levels 'A' and 'F' are missing, so 2 additional problems are needed.

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
- **Output**: `5`
- **Explanation**: Levels 'A', 'F', and 'G' are missing entirely, and levels 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' are each missing 1 problem. So, `3*2 + 4*1 = 10 - 5 = 5` additional problems are needed.

#### Example 3:
- **Input**: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
- **Output**: `1`
- **Explanation**: Level 'A' is missing, so 1 additional problem is needed.

### Edge Cases:
1. **All Levels Present**:
   - Input: `7 1 ABCDEFG`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: All levels are present, so no additional problems are needed.

2. **No Levels Present**:
   - Input: `0 1`
   - Output: `7`
   - Explanation: All levels are missing, so 7 additional problems are needed.

3. **Multiple Rounds**:
   - Input: `7 3 ABCDEFG`
   - Output: `14`
   - Explanation: All levels are present, but 2 additional problems of each level are needed for 3 rounds, so `7*2 = 14` additional problems are needed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given examples and edge cases. It ensures that for each test case, it calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to have one problem of each difficulty level for `m` rounds.

Correctness: **True**.
