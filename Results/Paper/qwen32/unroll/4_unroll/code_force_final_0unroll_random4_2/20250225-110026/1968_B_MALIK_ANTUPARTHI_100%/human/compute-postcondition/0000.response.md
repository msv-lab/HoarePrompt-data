The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an input value and converts it to an integer, then assigns this value to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are binary strings, but the code changes `a` to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, `b`, and `t` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer equal to the input value; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
