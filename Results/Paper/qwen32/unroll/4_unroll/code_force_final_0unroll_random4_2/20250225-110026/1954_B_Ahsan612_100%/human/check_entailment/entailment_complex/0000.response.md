### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers in the array. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly address the requirement to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Misunderstanding of the Problem:**
   - The program calculates the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. These are two different tasks.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program checks if the entire array is a single segment of identical numbers and returns `-1` in that case. This part is correct for the specific scenario where the entire array is uniform.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle other cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing a minimal number of elements. The logic to calculate the minimum number of elements to remove is missing.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform (all elements are the same) and returns `-1`.
   - However, it fails to handle cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing a few elements, such as in the fourth test case of the example.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one must identify the longest contiguous segments of identical numbers and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beauty" condition. This involves more sophisticated logic than just finding the minimum length of contiguous segments.
