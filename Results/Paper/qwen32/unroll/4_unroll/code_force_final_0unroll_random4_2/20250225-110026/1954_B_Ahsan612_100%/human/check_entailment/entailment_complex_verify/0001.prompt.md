You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import inf

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: - `same` will be 1 (since it is reset to 1 whenever a new segment starts and the loop ends after processing the last segment).
    #- `num` will be the last number in the last test case's list `ar`.
    #- `minn` will be the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers found in the last test case, or `-1` if the entire list was a single segment.
    #- `i` will be equal to the length of the last test case's list `ar` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list).
    #- `ar` will be the list of integers from the last test case.
    #- `n` will be the length of the last test case's list.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers in the list. If the entire list consists of a single segment of identical numbers, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the minimum length of these segments.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case and processes the array to determine if it can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It initializes `same` to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same.
4. It iterates through the array, updating `same` when consecutive elements are the same.
5. When it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count of consecutive elements (`minn`) and resets `same`.
6. After the loop, it checks the last sequence of elements.
7. If `minn` is still `inf` (which means no different elements were found) or if the entire array is composed of the same element (`minn == len(ar)`), it prints `-1` (impossible to make non-beautiful).
8. Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's evaluate the correctness of the program using the provided examples and the logic described:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `3, 2 2 2`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The entire array is the same, and it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5, 1 2 1 2 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) results in an array that cannot be made uniform using the given operation.
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `1, 1`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The array is already uniform and cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `7, 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing the first three `3`s results in an array that cannot be made uniform.
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

Based on the examples, the program seems to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove or conclude that it's impossible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-beautiful and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove when possible.

Correctness: **True**
