Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a potential issue.

The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. It does this by finding the smallest group of consecutive identical elements in the array. If this group size is 1 or the entire array is identical, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the size of the smallest group.

However, the logic for determining the smallest group of consecutive identical elements is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly handle cases where the smallest group is at the end of the array.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The array is beautiful, and we can remove the element `2` at index 1 to make it `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

However, the program will output `-1` for this input because the smallest group of consecutive identical elements is the group of `1`s at the beginning and end of the array, which has a size of `1`.

Let's modify the code to handle this case correctly:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

```

The main issue was that the `same` count was not being updated correctly when the loop ended. By moving the `minn = min(minn, same)` line outside the `else` block, we ensure that the last group of identical elements is considered.

Since the original code does not handle this edge case correctly, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is False.
