You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #- `num` will be the last number in the last test case's list `ar`.
    #- `minn` will be the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers found in the last test case, or `-1` if the entire list was a single segment.
    #- `i` will be equal to the length of the last test case's list `ar` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list).
    #- `ar` will be the list of integers from the last test case.
    #- `n` will be the length of the last test case's list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a potential issue.

The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. It does this by finding the smallest group of consecutive identical elements in the array. If this group size is 1 or the entire array is identical, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the size of the smallest group.

However, the logic for determining the smallest group of consecutive identical elements is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly handle cases where the smallest group is at the end of the array.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The array is beautiful, and we can remove the element `2` at index 1 to make it `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

However, the program will output `-1` for this input because the smallest group of consecutive identical elements is the group of `1`s at the beginning and end of the array, which has a size of `1`.

Let's modify the code to handle this case correctly:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

```

The main issue was that the `same` count was not being updated correctly when the loop ended. By moving the `minn = min(minn, same)` line outside the `else` block, we ensure that the last group of identical elements is considered.

Since the original code does not handle this edge case correctly, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is False.
