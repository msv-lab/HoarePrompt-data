Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Handling**:
   - The program checks if `b == c` and prints 'YES'. This is correct.
   - The program checks if `b < c` and prints 'NO'. This is also correct.
   - The program then checks if `a % 2 == b % 2` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on this condition. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves or cubes. The correct condition should be based on `b` (number of moves) and `c` (number of cubes).

2. **Parity Check**:
   - The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is because the difference between the number of moves (`b`) and the number of cubes (`c`) must be even for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves and cubes must match.

### Correct Condition:
The correct condition to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is:
- If `b` (number of moves) is even, `c` (number of cubes) must also be even.
- If `b` (number of moves) is odd, `c` (number of cubes) must also be odd.
- Additionally, `c` (number of cubes) must be within the range `0` to `b` (inclusive), because the maximum number of cubes you can have after `b` moves is `b` (if you add a cube in every move).

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the input:
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
Yes
No
Yes
```
However, the given program will produce incorrect results for the third test case (`5 3`), because it incorrectly checks the parity of `a` (number of test cases) instead of `b` (number of moves).

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected code checks the correct conditions and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
