Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap
Bob sells `n` buns, where the first `k` buns can be sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the maximum profit.

### Key Observations
1. **Case 1: \( a \geq b \)**
   - Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal because the promotional price cannot be higher than `a`.

2. **Case 2: \( a < b \)**
   - We need to find the optimal `k` to maximize profit.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution follows these steps:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `a >= b`, print `n * a`.
4. If `a < b`, calculate the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
5. Calculate the profit from the first `k` buns using the arithmetic series sum formula: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
6. Calculate the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
7. Print the total profit `ans + p2`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations
Let's evaluate the annotations and the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Handling:**
   - **Case 1: \( a \geq b \)**
     - The program correctly prints `n * a`.
   - **Case 2: \( a < b \)**
     - The program calculates `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`, which ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the number of promotional prices available.
     - The formula for the sum of the arithmetic series is correct: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
     - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is correctly calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is correctly calculated as `ans + p2`.

### Example Validation
Let's validate the solution with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)**
   - \( a < b \)
   - \( k = \min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2 \)
   - Profit from first 2 buns: \( \frac{(5 + (5 - 2 + 1))}{2} \times 2 = \frac{9}{2} \times 2 = 9 \)
   - Profit from remaining 2 buns: \( (4 - 2) \times 4 = 8 \)
   - Total profit: \( 9 + 8 = 17 \)

2. **Test Case 2: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)**
   - \( a < b \)
   - \( k = \min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5 \)
   - Profit from first 5 buns: \( \frac{(9 + (9 - 5 + 1))}{2} \times 5 = \frac{15}{2} \times 5 = 35 \)
   - Profit from remaining 0 buns: \( (5 - 5) \times 5 = 0 \)
   - Total profit: \( 35 + 0 = 35 \)

The results match the expected output, confirming the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly handles all cases and accurately calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The annotations and the logic in the code align with the problem description and the expected outcomes.
