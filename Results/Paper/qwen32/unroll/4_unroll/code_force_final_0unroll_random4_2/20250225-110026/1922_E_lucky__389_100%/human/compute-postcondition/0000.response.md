The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. However, the provided code snippet does not use `t` or `X` in any way; it simply reads a new integer input and assigns it to `x`.

Therefore, the value of `t` and the condition for `X` remain unchanged, and `x` is now assigned the value of the newly read integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer.**
