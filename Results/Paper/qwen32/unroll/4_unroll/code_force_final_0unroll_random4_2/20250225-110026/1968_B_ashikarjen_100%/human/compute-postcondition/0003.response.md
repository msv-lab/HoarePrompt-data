The given code snippet initializes a variable `k` to 0. The initial state includes `n` and `m` as integers representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively, and `a` and `b` as binary strings.

Since the code only initializes `k` and does not modify `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively; `a` is a binary string read from the input; `b` is a binary string read from the input; `k` is 0.**
