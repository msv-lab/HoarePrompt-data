The code snippet reads a single line of input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This line of input is expected to be a binary string. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were initially read from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively; `a` is a binary string read from the input.**
