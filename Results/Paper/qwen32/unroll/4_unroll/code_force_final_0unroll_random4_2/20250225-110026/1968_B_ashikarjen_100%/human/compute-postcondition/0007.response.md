To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to understand the context of the variables and how they are related.

Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
- `a` is a binary string of length `n`.
- `b` is a binary string of length `m`.
- `k` is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order.
- `j` is the index in `b` where the search stopped.

The variable `k` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `a` that appears in `b` in the same order. However, the exact values of `a`, `b`, `k`, and `j` are not provided, so we can only describe `k` in terms of the relationship between `a` and `b`.

Given this information, the `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the count of characters from `a` that appear in `b` in order.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order)**
