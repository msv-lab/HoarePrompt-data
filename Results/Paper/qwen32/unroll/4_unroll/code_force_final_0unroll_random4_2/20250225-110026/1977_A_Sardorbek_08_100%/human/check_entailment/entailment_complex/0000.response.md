### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here are the key points to consider:
1. **Addition and Removal**: Since each move can either add or remove one cube, the net effect of `n` moves can result in a change of `n` cubes (if all moves are additions) to `-n` cubes (if all moves are removals).
2. **Parity (Odd/Even)**: The critical insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` must match for it to be possible to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus, the parity of the number of cubes changes with each move. Starting from 0 (even), after an even number of moves, the number of cubes will be even, and after an odd number of moves, the number of cubes will be odd.
3. **Special Cases**: If `b == c`, it means the number of moves is exactly equal to the number of cubes desired, which is a straightforward case where all moves are additions. If `b < c`, it is impossible to have more cubes than moves since each move can add at most one cube.

The given program checks:
- If `b == c`, it prints "YES" because it's possible to add exactly `c` cubes in `b` moves.
- If `b < c`, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes" because the parity of `b` and `c` matches, meaning it's possible to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves.
- Otherwise, it prints "No" because the parities do not match.

The program correctly handles all these cases:
- It checks for equality of `b` and `c` directly.
- It checks if `b` is less than `c` to rule out impossible scenarios.
- It checks the parity of `b` and `c` to determine if it's possible to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes using `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
