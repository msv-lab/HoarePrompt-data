### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a game between Alice and Bob where they take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (Alice) or simply deleting them (Bob). The goal is to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Optimal Strategy:
- **Alice's Goal:** Maximize the MEX of `c`.
- **Bob's Goal:** Minimize the MEX of `c`.

The key insight is that Alice can ensure that the MEX of `c` is at least the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `a` (if any) or the smallest integer that does not appear in `a` at all. This is because Alice can always pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `a` to ensure it ends up in `c`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. It then iterates over the range from `0` to `n` to find the smallest integer that either:
1. Does not appear in `a` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`).
2. Appears exactly once in `a` and is not the smallest such number that appears exactly once (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1 and first`).

However, the condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first` is incorrect because it will not correctly identify the smallest integer that appears exactly once. The correct logic should be to identify the smallest integer that appears exactly once and then consider the smallest integer that does not appear in `a`.

#### Correct Logic:
1. Identify the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `a`.
2. If no such integer exists, identify the smallest integer that does not appear in `a`.

The current logic in the program does not correctly implement this strategy. Specifically, the `first` flag is not used correctly, and the program may not identify the smallest integer that appears exactly once correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the optimal MEX based on the described strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
