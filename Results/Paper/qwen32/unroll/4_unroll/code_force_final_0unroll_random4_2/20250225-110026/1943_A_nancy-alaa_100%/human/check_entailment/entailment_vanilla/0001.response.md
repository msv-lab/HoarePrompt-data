Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to play on an array `a`. Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, while Bob's goal is to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations:
1. **Turns and Moves**: Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and adding them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them from `a` (Bob). The game ends when `a` is empty.
2. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
3. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.

### Strategy:
- If an integer `i` appears an odd number of times in `a`, Alice can ensure that `i` ends up in `c` by picking it an odd number of times (since Bob can only remove it an even number of times).
- If an integer `i` appears an even number of times, Alice cannot force `i` into `c` because Bob can always remove the last occurrence of `i`.
- The MEX will be the smallest integer that is not covered by the integers that Alice can force into `c`.

### Correctness of the Program:
The provided program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. It then iterates through the integers from `0` to `n` and checks:
1. If an integer `i` is not present in the array, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
2. If an integer `i` is present exactly once and it's the first such integer, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
3. If an integer `i` is present exactly once but it's not the first such integer, it does nothing and continues.

However, this logic does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy. The program does not account for the fact that Alice can only force integers with odd occurrences into `c`. It simply checks for the first integer that is either not present or appears exactly once, which does not align with the optimal play strategy.

### Correct Approach:
1. Count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
2. Determine which integers can be forced into `c` by Alice (those with odd occurrences).
3. The MEX will be the smallest integer that is not covered by these integers.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
