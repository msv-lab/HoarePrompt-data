Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. The program simply finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `arr` and prints it, which does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob or their respective objectives.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can pick `0` on her first turn, making `c = [0]` and `a = [1, 1, 2]`.
- Bob can pick `1` on his turn, making `a = [1, 2]`.
- Alice can pick `1` on her next turn, making `c = [0, 1]` and `a = [2]`.
- Bob can pick `2` on his turn, making `a = []`.
- The final array `c = [0, 1]` has a MEX of `2`.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
3
```

The program incorrectly outputs `3` because it simply finds the smallest non-negative integer not in the array `arr` (which is `3` in this case), without considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game with both players playing optimally and then calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
