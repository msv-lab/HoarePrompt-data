Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them (Bob).
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Points:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of `c` is crucial. It is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.
2. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning Alice will try to ensure the MEX is as high as possible, while Bob will try to keep it as low as possible.
3. **Turns**: Alice and Bob alternate turns, starting with Alice.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`. It then uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

The program then iterates over the range `[0, n]` and checks for the first integer `i` that is not present in `arr` or has an odd count (indicating that Alice can pick it last to maximize the MEX).

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the first integer with an odd count is the correct MEX. This is not necessarily true because Bob can always pick such elements to minimize the MEX.
   - The program does not account for the optimal strategy where both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The correct approach is to consider the parity of counts and the fact that Alice can always ensure the MEX is as high as possible by carefully choosing elements.

### Correct Approach:
- Count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
- Determine the smallest integer `i` that is not present in `arr` or has an odd count.
- However, this is not the complete solution. The correct strategy involves considering the parity of counts and the optimal moves of both players.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. It incorrectly assumes that the first integer with an odd count is the correct MEX, which is not always true.

**Correctness: False**
