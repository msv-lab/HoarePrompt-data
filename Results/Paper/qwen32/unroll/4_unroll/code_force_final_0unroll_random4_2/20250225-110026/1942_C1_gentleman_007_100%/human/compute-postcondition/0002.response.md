The code snippet initializes a new list named `Lowest_Prime` with `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`. This does not affect the values of `num`, `prime`, or `Highest_Prime`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`.**
