In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `p <= num`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `p` is less than or equal to `num`. 

Given the initial state:
- `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`.
- `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`.
- `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`.
- `p` is 2.

Let's analyze the loop condition: `p <= num`. Since `p` is initialized to 2 and `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, the condition `p <= num` will always be true for the first iteration because `2 <= num` holds true when `num` is at least 2.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time. The state can remain as it is.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `p` is 2**
