The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m`, an integer representing the number of edges (diagonals) to be drawn between chosen vertices. It returns a 2D list `l` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with `1`s at positions `[x][y]` and `[y][x]` for each pair `(x, y)` returned by `func_1()`, indicating the presence of an edge (diagonal) between vertices `x` and `y`.
