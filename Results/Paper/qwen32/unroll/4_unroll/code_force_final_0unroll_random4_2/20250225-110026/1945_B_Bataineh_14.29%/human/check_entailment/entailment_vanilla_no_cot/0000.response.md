Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program is incorrect, especially the condition `if m < a or m < b: print(2)` and the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the interval `[0, m]` and also account for the overlaps where fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time. The correct approach involves using the Least Common Multiple (LCM) to find the overlaps.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        count_a = (m // a) + 1
        count_b = (m // b) + 1
        count_overlap = (m // lcm_ab) + 1
        max_fireworks = count_a + count_b - count_overlap
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the interval `[0, m]` and subtracts the overlaps to avoid double-counting fireworks that are visible at the same time due to both installations.
