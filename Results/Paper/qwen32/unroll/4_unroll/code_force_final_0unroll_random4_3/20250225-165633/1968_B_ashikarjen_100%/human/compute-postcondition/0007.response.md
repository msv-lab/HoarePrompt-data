To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Inputs:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers (first and second integer inputs, respectively).
   - `a` and `b` are binary strings (first and second binary string inputs, respectively).

2. **Variables:**
   - `k` is the count of matched characters in `a` that appear in `b` in the correct order.
   - `j` is the position in `b` where the search stopped.

3. **Objective:**
   - The variable `k` is determined by counting how many characters in `a` appear in `b` in the same order, starting from the beginning of both strings.

**Explanation:**
- The variable `k` is essentially the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` that appears in the same order from the start of both strings.
- If `a` is "1101" and `b` is "1011", `k` would be 2 because the longest common subsequence starting from the beginning is "10".

**Output:**
- The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the count of matched characters in `a` that appear in `b` in the correct order.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the count of matched characters in `a` that appear in `b` in the correct order)**
