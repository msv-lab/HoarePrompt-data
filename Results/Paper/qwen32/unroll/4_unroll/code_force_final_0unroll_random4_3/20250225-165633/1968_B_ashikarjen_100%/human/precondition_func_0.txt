There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The strings a and b consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
