You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: result is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of screens required for each test case.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: The `print` statement will output each integer from the `result` list on a new line.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` and calculates the number of screens required based on the given conditions. It then outputs the number of screens required for each test case on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for placing the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case, which consists of two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1` (total cells required for 1x1 icons).
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4` (total cells required for 2x2 icons).
   - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
   - This logic seems correct as each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3 grid).

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This represents the remaining cells on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, it means the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, and the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the `extra_space` needed for 1x1 icons and determines the number of additional screens required (`extra_screen`).
   - `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15, otherwise `extra_space // 15`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list and prints the results.
