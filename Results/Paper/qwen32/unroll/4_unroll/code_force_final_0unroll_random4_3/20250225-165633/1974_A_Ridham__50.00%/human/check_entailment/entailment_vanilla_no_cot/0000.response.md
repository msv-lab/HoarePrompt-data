Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all test cases. The logic for handling the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and calculating the additional screens for 1x1 icons needs to be re-evaluated. Specifically, the program does not optimally pack the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

Here are some key points to consider:
1. Each screen has 15 cells.
2. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
3. The program should first place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens, then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.
4. The program should ensure that the remaining cells are optimally used to minimize the number of additional screens.

The current logic incorrectly assumes that remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons can always be filled with 1x1 icons without considering the optimal arrangement. For example, placing a 2x2 icon leaves 11 cells, and it's not always optimal to fill these with 1x1 icons without considering the next screen.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Each screen has 15 cells
        total_cells = 15
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        while y > 0:
            screens += 1
            y -= 2  # Place two 2x2 icons per screen if possible
            if y < 0:
                y = 0  # Ensure y does not go negative

        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = total_cells * screens - (y // 2) * 4
        
        # Place 1x1 icons
        if x > 0:
            if remaining_cells >= x:
                screens += 0  # No additional screens needed
            else:
                x -= remaining_cells  # Fill remaining cells with 1x1 icons
                screens += (x + 14) // 15  # Calculate additional screens for remaining 1x1 icons
        
        result.append(screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that 2x2 icons are placed first, and then the remaining cells are optimally used to place 1x1 icons, minimizing the number of additional screens needed.
