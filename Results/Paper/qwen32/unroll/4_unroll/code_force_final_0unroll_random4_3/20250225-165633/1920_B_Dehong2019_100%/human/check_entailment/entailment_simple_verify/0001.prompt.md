You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice can remove at most `k` elements from the array.
- Bob can multiply at most `x` elements of the array by -1.
- Alice wants to maximize the sum, while Bob wants to minimize it.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, the number of elements, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can negate, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial sum of the sorted array `a` and stores it in `ans1`.

3. **Bob's Action Simulation:**
   - The program then simulates Bob's action of negating the first `x` elements of the sorted array. This is done by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements from `ans1` (since negating an element twice would bring it back to its original value).

4. **Alice's Action Simulation:**
   - The program then simulates Alice's action of removing one element at a time from the sorted array.
   - For each element removed by Alice, it adjusts the sum by adding the removed element back (since Alice removes it) and simulates Bob's action of negating the element that would be next in line after Alice's removal.
   - The program keeps track of the maximum sum (`ans2`) obtained after each possible action by Alice.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The sorting of the array in descending order is crucial because it allows us to easily simulate the optimal actions of both players.
- The initial sum calculation (`ans1`) is correct as it starts with the sum of all elements.
- The simulation of Bob's action by negating the first `x` elements is correct because these are the `x` largest elements, which Bob would negate to minimize the sum.
- The simulation of Alice's action by removing elements one by one and adjusting the sum by considering Bob's subsequent negation is also correct. By iterating through the array and adjusting the sum based on the next element Bob could negate, the program effectively simulates the optimal play by both players.
- The program keeps track of the maximum sum (`ans2`) obtained after each possible action by Alice, which is the desired result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the optimal actions of both Alice and Bob and calculates the maximum sum of the array after the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
