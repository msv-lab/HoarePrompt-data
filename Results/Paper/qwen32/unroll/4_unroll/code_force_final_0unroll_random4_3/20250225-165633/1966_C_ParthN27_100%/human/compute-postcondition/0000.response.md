For the given task, the loop head consists of the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should be the number of test cases, `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains `_` (a throwaway variable) and `int(input())` (which will be the number of test cases, `t`).
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.
3. **Adjust the state**: The state should ensure that `t` (the result of `int(input())`) is at least 1. The variable `_` does not need any specific state as it is a throwaway variable.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the number of test cases, `t`, is at least 1.

State: **`t` (the number of test cases) must be greater than or equal to 1**
