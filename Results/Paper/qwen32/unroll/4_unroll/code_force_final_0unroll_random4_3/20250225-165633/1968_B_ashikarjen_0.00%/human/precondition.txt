There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, n and m are integers representing the lengths of binary strings a and b respectively (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5). The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. String a and string b consist only of the characters '0' and '1'.
