The variable `b` is reassigned the value of the input string. The lengths of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation, so `n` remains the length of `a` and `m` is now the length of the new input string assigned to `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `n` is the length of `a`, `m` is the length of the new input string**.
