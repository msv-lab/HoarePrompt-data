To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

- `a` is the input string.
- `b` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the string `a`.
- `m` is the length of the string `b`.
- `k` is the number of characters from `a` found in `b` in order.
- `j` is the position in `b` where the search stopped.

The variable `k` represents the count of characters from `a` that appear in `b` in the same order as they appear in `a`. This implies that `k` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` where the characters appear in the same order.

However, the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `j` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the numerical value of `k`.

Given the information provided, we can only describe `k` in terms of the relationship between `a` and `b`.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters from the string `a` found in the string `b` in order)**
