There are t test cases where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers representing the lengths of binary strings a and b respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The strings a and b consist only of the characters '0' and '1'.
