You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are t test cases where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers representing the lengths of binary strings a and b respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The strings a and b consist only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: a is the input string, b is the new input string, n is the length of a, m is the length of the new input string, k is the number of characters from a found in b in order, j is the position in b where the search stopped.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters from the string `a` found in the string `b` in order)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The strings `a` and `b` consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given binary strings `a` and `b`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
