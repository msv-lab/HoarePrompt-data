The code assigns the value of `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `times`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `check` with the value `2147483647` (which is `2 ** 31 - 1`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` is the integer input representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, and `check` is 2147483647.**
