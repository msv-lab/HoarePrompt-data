The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `times`. This integer input represents the number of test cases, `t`. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet as they are not referenced or modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` is the integer input representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
