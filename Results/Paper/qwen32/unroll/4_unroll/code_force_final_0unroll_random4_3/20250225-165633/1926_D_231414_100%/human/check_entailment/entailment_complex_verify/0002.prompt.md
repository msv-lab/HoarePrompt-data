You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    #State: t is the initial value of t, times is the initial value of times, n is the value of n from the last test case, a is the list of integers from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is between 0 and 2^31 - 1. It then performs operations on the list and prints the result for each test case, which is the count of unique elements after a specific transformation involving bitwise XOR with 2^31 - 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to divide a list of integers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of such groups.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `times`: Number of test cases.
   - `check`: A mask with all 31 bits set to 1 (i.e., `2**31 - 1`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `n`: Number of integers in the current test case.
   - `data`: List of integers for the current test case.
   - `dic`: A dictionary to keep track of the "complementary" numbers. A complementary number `s` for a number `i` is computed as `i ^ check`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
   - `ans`: Counter for the number of groups.

3. **Logic for Grouping:**
   - For each integer `i` in `data`:
     - Compute `s` as `i ^ check`.
     - If `i` is already in `dic`, it means we have encountered a number that can be grouped with its complement `i`. We decrement the count of `i` in `dic`. If the count becomes zero, we remove `i` from `dic`.
     - If `i` is not in `dic`:
       - If `s` is not in `dic`, we initialize its count to 0.
       - We increment the count of `s` in `dic` and increase the group count `ans` by 1.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic of using the XOR operation to find the complement is correct. For any number `i`, `i ^ check` will give a number that has all the bits flipped in the 31 least significant bits.
- The dictionary `dic` is used to keep track of the counts of these complementary numbers. This ensures that we can efficiently determine if a number can be grouped with its complement.
- However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the grouping logic. The code seems to be attempting to decrement the count of `i` in `dic` when it should be checking for the presence of `s` (the complement) in `dic`.
- The correct approach should be to check if `s` (the complement) is already in `dic`. If it is, we do not need a new group; otherwise, we need a new group and add `s` to `dic`.

### Corrected Logic:
- For each integer `i` in `data`:
  - Compute `s` as `i ^ check`.
  - If `s` is in `dic`, it means we can group `i` with its complement. We do not need to create a new group.
  - If `s` is not in `dic`, we need a new group and add `s` to `dic`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for grouping the numbers based on their complementary bit patterns. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.

Correctness: **False**
