Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which reads an integer from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which reads a line of space-separated integers.
   - For each throw, it reads `r` and `c` using `func_1().split()`. The `r` value is converted to an integer, and `c` remains a string.

2. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the throw.
   - For each player `q` in the current set `ans`, it checks the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp` (clockwise).
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp` (counterclockwise).
   - After processing all players in `ans`, it updates `ans` to be `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in `ans` (which can happen due to modulo operation) and replaces it with `n` if necessary. This ensures that player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball (`len(ans)`) and the sorted list of these players.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Initialization:** The starting player `x` is correctly initialized in the set `ans`.
- **Direction Handling:** The program correctly handles both clockwise (`'0'`) and counterclockwise (`'1'`) directions, as well as the unknown direction (`'?'`).
- **Modulo Operation:** The use of modulo operation ensures that the player positions wrap around the circle correctly.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles the edge case where the modulo operation results in `0` by converting it to `n`.
- **Output:** The program outputs the correct number of possible players and their sorted list.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, considering all possible directions for throws marked with `'?'`.

**Correctness: **True**
