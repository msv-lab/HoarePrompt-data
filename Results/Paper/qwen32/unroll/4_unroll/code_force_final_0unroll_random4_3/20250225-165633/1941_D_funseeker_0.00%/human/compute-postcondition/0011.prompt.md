You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1, m is a non-negative integer, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n. ans is a set initialized with the value x. r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and c is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set of values generated by the loop operations. `r` and `c` are the values from the last iteration of the loop.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set of values generated by the loop operations. If `0` is in `ans`, `ans` now includes `n` and excludes `0`. `r` and `c` are the values from the last iteration of the loop.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where ans is the set of values generated by the loop operations with the condition that if 0 was in ans, it is replaced by n)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the elements of the set `ans` after the loop operations and the condition (if 0 was in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c`. `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'. The function returns a set `ans` that is initialized with the value `x`. The function modifies the set `ans` based on the values of `m`, `r`, and `c`, and returns the modified set. The specific modifications depend on the values of `m`, `r`, and `c` as described in the cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
