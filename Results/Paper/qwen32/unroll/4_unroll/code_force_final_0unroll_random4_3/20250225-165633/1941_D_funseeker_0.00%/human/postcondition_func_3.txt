The function generates a set of integers based on initial conditions and a series of operations. It starts with a set containing a single integer `x`. For each of `m` iterations, it modifies the set by adding or subtracting a value `r` (modulo `n`), depending on the character `c` which can be '0', '1', or '?'. If the resulting set contains `0`, it replaces `0` with `n`. The function then prints the size of the final set and its elements.
