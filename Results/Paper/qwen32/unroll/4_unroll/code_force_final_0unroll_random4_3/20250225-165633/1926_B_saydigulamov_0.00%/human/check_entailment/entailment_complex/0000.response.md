### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic for Shape Detection**:
   - The code only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows (`k[0] == k[1]`) and prints the counts if they are equal. This is insufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.
   - For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's, and the '1's should be positioned such that they form a square.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow a specific pattern: the i-th row should have `2*i - 1` '1's for an upright triangle or `2*(n-i+1) - 1` '1's for an upside-down triangle. Additionally, the '1's should be centered in the grid for an upright triangle or positioned such that they form an upside-down triangle.

2. **Output**:
   - The code does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement. Instead, it prints the counts of '1's in the rows where '1's are present.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
