You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of '0's and '1's. It then checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows of the grid are equal and prints the counts if they are.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:**
   - An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the size of the grid.
   - An `n x n` grid of characters, each either '0' or '1'.
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print "SQUARE" if the grid contains a square, or "TRIANGLE" if the grid contains a triangle.
   
3. **Shape Definitions:**
   - A **square** is defined as a shape of `k x k` '1's where `k > 1`.
   - A **triangle** is defined as a shape of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` '1's, or an upside-down triangle with the same property.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.
   - It then reads the grid row by row.
   
2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - For each row in the grid that contains at least one '1', it counts the number of '1's and appends this count to the list `k`.
   
3. **Determining the Shape:**
   - The program checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).
   - If they are equal, it prints the entire list `k`.
   - If they are not equal, the program does nothing, which means it does not print anything for that case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Output Requirements:**
   - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required.
   - Instead, it prints the entire list `k` when `k[0] == k[1]`, which is not the expected output.
   
2. **Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The program only checks if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's.
   - This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.
   - For example, a triangle might have the first two rows with 1 and 3 '1's, respectively, but the program would not handle this correctly.
   
3. **Handling Upside-Down Triangles:**
   - The program does not account for upside-down triangles.
   
4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape does not start at the top-left corner of the grid.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle, nor does it produce the correct output format.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
