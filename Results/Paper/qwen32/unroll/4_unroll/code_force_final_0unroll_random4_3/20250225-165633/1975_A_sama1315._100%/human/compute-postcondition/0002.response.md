The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `idx` to 0. No other variables are affected, and no calculations or changes are made to the existing variables `a` and `data`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input; `idx` is 0.**
