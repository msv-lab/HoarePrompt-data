### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided solution using the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. The key insight is that the array can be rotated to achieve a sorted order if and only if there exists a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The solution concatenates the array with itself and checks if any subarray of length `n` within this concatenated array is sorted. If such a subarray exists, it indicates that the original array can be rotated to become sorted.

#### Annotations and Code Evaluation:
1. **Concatenation**:
   ```python
   concatenated_a = a + a
   ```
   This step creates a new array that contains the original array repeated twice. This allows for easy checking of all possible rotations of the array.

2. **Checking Subarrays**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
           return 'Yes'
   ```
   The code iterates over all possible starting points of subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` and checks if any of these subarrays match the sorted version of `a`. If a match is found, it returns "Yes".

3. **Output**:
   ```python
   return 'No'
   ```
   If no matching subarray is found after checking all possible rotations, it returns "No".

#### Validation with Examples:
- **Example 1**:
  ```
  Input:
  6
  1 1 4 5 1 4
  ```
  - Sorted version: `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
  - Concatenated array: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
  - No subarray of length 6 matches the sorted version.
  - Output: "No" (Correct)

- **Example 2**:
  ```
  Input:
  5
  7 9 2 2 3
  ```
  - Sorted version: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
  - Concatenated array: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
  - Subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted version.
  - Output: "Yes" (Correct)

- **Example 3**:
  ```
  Input:
  3
  1 2 3
  ```
  - Sorted version: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Concatenated array: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Subarray `[1, 2, 3]` matches the sorted version.
  - Output: "Yes" (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the array can be sorted by rotating it. It efficiently checks all possible rotations by leveraging array concatenation and subarray comparison. The annotations and the code evaluation support the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
