To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`a`**: This is the last list of integers processed in a loop.
2. **`data`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the context provided.
3. **`idx`**: This variable is incremented by the total number of integers processed plus `t`, but it is not used in the print statement.
4. **`t`**: This variable remains the same throughout the context provided.
5. **`results`**: This is a list that contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
- The `join` method is used to concatenate all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
- Each element in the `results` list is the result of calling the function `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

### Output Description:
Since the exact contents of `results` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `results`. The `results` list contains the outcomes of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, and these outcomes are joined together with newline characters.

### Final Output:
Output: **Each element of the `results` list, separated by newline characters (where each element is the result of `func_1(a)` for each iteration)**
