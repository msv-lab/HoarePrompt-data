### Reasoning:

The provided solution aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The core idea is to check if any rotation of the array can result in a sorted array.

The solution works by concatenating the array with itself and then checking if any subarray of the original length within this concatenated array matches the sorted version of the original array. If such a subarray exists, it implies that a rotation of the original array can result in a sorted array, and the solution returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".

Let's break down the logic and verify it step-by-step:

1. **Concatenation**: The array `a` is concatenated with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This allows us to easily check for any possible rotation of the array.
2. **Checking Subarrays**: The code iterates over all possible starting points of subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` and checks if any of these subarrays match the sorted version of `a`.
3. **Output**: If a matching subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

### Validation using Annotations:

- **State of `func_1`**:
  - Before the function call: `a` is a list of positive integers, and `n` is the length of the list `a` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
  - Inside the function:
    - `sorted_a` is the sorted version of `a`.
    - `concatenated_a` is the array `a` concatenated with itself.
    - The function then iterates over all possible starting points of subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` and checks if any of these subarrays match `sorted_a`.
    - If a match is found, it returns "Yes".
    - If no match is found after the loop, it returns "No".

- **State of `func_2`**:
  - Before the function call: The input is read from standard input, split into a list of strings, and processed to extract the number of test cases `t` and the arrays for each test case.
  - Inside the function:
    - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
    - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted by rotations and appends the result to the `results` list.
    - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Example Walkthrough:

1. **First Test Case (Input: `6`, `1 1 4 5 1 4`)**:
   - `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - `sorted_a = [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
   - `concatenated_a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - Checking all subarrays of length 6 in `concatenated_a`:
     - None of the subarrays match `sorted_a`.
   - Output: "No"

2. **Second Test Case (Input: `5`, `7 9 2 2 3`)**:
   - `a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a = [2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
   - `concatenated_a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Checking all subarrays of length 5 in `concatenated_a`:
     - Subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches `sorted_a`.
   - Output: "Yes"

3. **Third Test Case (Input: `3`, `1 2 3`)**:
   - `a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Checking all subarrays of length 3 in `concatenated_a`:
     - Subarray `[1, 2, 3]` matches `sorted_a`.
   - Output: "Yes"

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the array can be sorted by rotating it. It efficiently checks all possible rotations by leveraging array concatenation and subarray comparison. The annotations and the example walkthrough confirm that the solution works as intended.

Therefore, the correctness of the solution is:

Final: **True**
