Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Logic for Finding Pairs**:
   The program checks if there exists a pair of friends (i, p_i) such that p_i is the best friend of i and vice versa (i.e., l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because only two invitations are needed to bring both friends to the party. This is correct for cases where such a pair exists.

2. **Handling Cases Without Pairs**:
   If no such pair is found, the program defaults to printing `3`. However, this is not always correct. For example, consider the case where there are no pairs but there are cycles or other structures that allow fewer than 3 invitations to bring at least 2 friends.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Cycles**: If there are cycles of length 3 or more, it might be possible to bring at least 2 friends with fewer than 3 invitations.
   - **Disconnected Pairs**: If there are multiple pairs but no single pair, the program might incorrectly default to `3` when it could be `2` if two separate pairs can be found.

Let's provide a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample**:
```
2
4
2 3 4 1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Expected Output**:
```
2
2
```
**Actual Output** (from the given program):
```
3
3
```

In the first test case, friends 1 and 2 form a pair, and friends 3 and 4 form another pair. Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 3, and both pairs will come to the party, making the minimum number of invitations `2`.

In the second test case, there are no pairs, but friends 1 and 2 form a cycle, and friends 3 and 4 form another cycle. Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 3, and both pairs will come to the party, making the minimum number of invitations `2`.

Thus, the program fails to handle these cases correctly and defaults to `3` invitations unnecessarily. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
