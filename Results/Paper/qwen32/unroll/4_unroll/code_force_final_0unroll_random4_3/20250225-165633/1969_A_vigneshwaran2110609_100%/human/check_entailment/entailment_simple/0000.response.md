Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's break down the issues with the code:

1. The outer loop `for i in range(n):` is incorrect. This loop should iterate over the number of test cases `t`, not the number of friends `n`. The correct loop should be `for _ in range(t):`.

2. Inside the loop, the variable `x` is read from the input, but this variable is not used correctly. The variable `x` is supposed to represent `n`, the number of friends, but it is instead used as the loop bound for the inner loop, which is incorrect.

3. The inner loop `for i in range(0, x):` is supposed to iterate over the list of friends, but it uses `x` as the loop bound, which is incorrect as explained above. It should be `for i in range(n):`.

4. The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:` checks if the best friend of the i-th friend is the i-th friend itself, which is not the correct condition to check if the i-th friend and their best friend can both come to the party. The correct condition should be to check if both the i-th friend and their best friend are invited.

5. The program prints `2` if the condition is met and `3` otherwise. However, this logic is flawed. The program should determine the minimum number of invitations required for at least two friends to come to the party, which may not always be `2` or `3`.

6. The program does not account for the fact that the best friend relationship forms a permutation of the friends, and the solution requires finding cycles in this permutation to determine the minimum number of invitations.

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
