The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists any integer in the list `p` that is in its "correct" position (i.e., `p_i = i`). If such an integer exists, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`. The function outputs a result for each test case on a new line.
