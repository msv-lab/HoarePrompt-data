Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the path is a string of n characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', and the first character of the path is '.'; `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of an input integer, but the values of `t`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
