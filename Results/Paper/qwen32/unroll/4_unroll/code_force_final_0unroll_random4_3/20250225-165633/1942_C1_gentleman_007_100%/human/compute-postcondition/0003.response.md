Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`.**

The first two elements of the `prime` list, which were originally `True`, are now `False`. The values of `num`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` remain unchanged.
