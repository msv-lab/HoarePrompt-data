The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m`, an integer representing the number of pairs of vertices for which diagonals are to be drawn. It returns a 2D list `l` of dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` with 1s at positions `[x][y]` and `[y][x]` for each pair `(x, y)` returned by `func_1()`, and 0s elsewhere.
