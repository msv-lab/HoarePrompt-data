Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the described operations. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function and how the results are used to determine the final output.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number in the input list `arr` and cap this frequency at `k`. However, this does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The function simply returns a dictionary with the frequency of each card number, capped at `k`, but this does not provide any meaningful information about the number of cards that can be reduced.

2. **Using the result of `func_1`**: After calling `func_1`, the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary. If it is, the program outputs `k - 1`. Otherwise, it outputs `n`. This logic is flawed because the presence of `k` in the frequency dictionary does not indicate whether `k` cards of the same number can be exchanged, and even if they can, it does not help in calculating the minimum number of cards left.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program handles only a few specific cases correctly (like when `k > n` or `k == n`), but it fails to correctly compute the minimum number of cards for more general cases.

The correct approach would involve calculating the total number of cards that can be reduced by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards, and then determining the remainder when the total number of cards is divided by `k-1`. This remainder would give the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    total_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        total_cards += count // (k - 1)
        if count % (k - 1) != 0:
            total_cards += 1
    
    print(total_cards)
```

This corrected program calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering how many groups of `k-1` cards can be formed from the counts of each card number.

Correctness: **False**
