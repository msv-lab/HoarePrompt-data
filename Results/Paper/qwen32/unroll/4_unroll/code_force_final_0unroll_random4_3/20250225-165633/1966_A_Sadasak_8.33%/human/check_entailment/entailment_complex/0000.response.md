Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cards left after performing the described operations. However, the logic in the provided program does not correctly determine the solution. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic in the Main Block:**
   - If `k > n`, it correctly prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k == n`, it correctly prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all cards for `k-1` cards.
   - The logic for the `else` case (when `k < n`) is flawed. Specifically, it checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table returned by `func_1`. This check does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `arr` but caps the frequency at `k`. This means that if a number appears more than `k` times, it will only count up to `k` occurrences. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The function should return the actual frequency of each card number without capping it.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the remainder of the frequency of each card number when divided by `k`. This remainder represents the minimum number of cards of that number that will remain after performing the operations. The sum of these remainders gives the minimum number of cards left.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
