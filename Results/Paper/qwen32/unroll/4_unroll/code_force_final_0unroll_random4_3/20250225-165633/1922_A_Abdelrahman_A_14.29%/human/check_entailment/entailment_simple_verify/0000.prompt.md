You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, the variables `t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their initial values. The loop processes each test case by reading inputs for `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified. The variable `no` is a boolean flag used within each iteration to determine if a 'NO' should be printed, but it does not affect the overall state outside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are some issues with the code:

1. The code checks if `c == a` or `c == b` and prints "NO" if true. This is not the correct condition as per the problem description. The problem requires checking whether there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not. This check does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template correctly.

2. The code then checks if any character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b` and prints "YES" if true. This is also incorrect. The problem requires that for each position `i`, if the `i-th` character of the template is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`, and if `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`. The code does not check these conditions.

3. The code does not construct or check against a template `t` at all. It only performs checks that do not align with the problem's requirements.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:

Input:
```
1
2
aa
bb
ab
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
Explanation:
- Template `t` can be "AB". 
- `a` matches `t` because 'a' is different from 'A'.
- `b` matches `t` because 'b' is different from 'B'.
- `c` does not match `t` because 'a' is the same as 'A'.

However, the provided code will print "NO" for this input, which is incorrect.

A correct implementation would involve constructing a template `t` for each position based on the characters in `a` and `b` and then checking if `c` matches this template.
