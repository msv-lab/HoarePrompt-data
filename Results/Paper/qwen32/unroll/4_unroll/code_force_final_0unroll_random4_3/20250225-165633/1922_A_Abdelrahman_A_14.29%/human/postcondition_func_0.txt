The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n`. For each test case, it determines if there is at least one character in `c` that is not present in both `a` and `b`. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values and performs this check independently for each test case.
