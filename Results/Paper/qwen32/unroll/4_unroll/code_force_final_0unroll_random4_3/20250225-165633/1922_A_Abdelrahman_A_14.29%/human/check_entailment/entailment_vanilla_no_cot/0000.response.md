Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The logic in the program is flawed for several reasons:

1. The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and immediately prints "NO" if they are. However, this is not the correct condition to determine if there exists a valid template. The template can still be valid even if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` as long as there is at least one position where the characters in `a` and `b` differ from the corresponding character in `c`.

2. The program then checks if any character in `c` is not present in `a` or `b`. If it finds such a character, it prints "YES". This condition is also incorrect. The presence of a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b` does not guarantee that there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. The template needs to match the conditions for all positions, not just the presence of characters.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check each position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` to see if it's possible to construct a template that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, the template at position `i` must be `A[i].upper()` if `a[i] != c[i]` (since `a[i]` must match the template and `c[i]` must not).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, the template at position `i` can be either `a[i].upper()` or `b[i].upper()` as long as `c[i]` does not match the lowercase version of the template character.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for _ in range(tests):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if a[i] == c[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            else:
                if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
        
        if valid:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This program correctly checks each position to see if it's possible to construct a valid template.
