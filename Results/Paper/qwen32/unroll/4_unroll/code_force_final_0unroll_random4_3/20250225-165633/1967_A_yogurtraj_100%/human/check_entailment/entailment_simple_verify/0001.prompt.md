You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine the maximum score, which is defined as the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. You start with a certain number of cards of each type and can buy up to `k` additional cards. The goal is to maximize the score after purchasing and rearranging the cards.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it does the following:
1. Reads the number of distinct types of cards `n` and the number of coins `k`.
2. Reads the list of integers `a` representing the number of cards of each type.
3. Sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
4. Initializes `r` to the smallest number of cards (`a[0]`), `rem` to 0, and `y` to 0.
5. Iterates through the sorted list to determine the maximum number of cards that can be equalized with the minimum number of operations (subtractions of the differences).
6. If the remaining coins `k` are not enough to equalize the next set of cards, it calculates the maximum possible number of cards that can be equalized with the remaining coins and breaks the loop.
7. If all cards can be equalized, it calculates the score based on the equalized number of cards.
8. If there are still remaining coins after equalizing, it distributes them among the cards and calculates the score.

### Detailed Reasoning:
The program's approach is to try to make all the counts of cards equal by using the minimum number of coins. This is a greedy strategy that tries to balance the counts of cards as much as possible with the given coins.

However, the program seems to have an issue in the logic for calculating the final score when there are remaining coins after equalizing the counts. Specifically, the calculation of the final score does not correctly account for the distribution of the remaining coins among the cards.

### Example:
For the test case:
```
3 4
6 1 8
```
The program would sort the list to `[1, 6, 8]`. It would then try to equalize the counts. It would first try to make all counts equal to 6, which requires 5 coins (to make the first count from 1 to 6). This leaves 1 coin. The program would then try to make all counts equal to 7, which requires 2 more coins (to make the second count from 6 to 7), but it only has 1 coin left. So, it would make the first count 7 (using the remaining coin) and leave the second count as 6 and the third count as 8. The final counts would be `[7, 6, 8]`. The score calculation would then be incorrect because it does not correctly account for the distribution of the remaining coins.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining coins, leading to incorrect score calculations in some cases.
