Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates two scores, `bm` and `sm`, based on the values in `p` and `a`, and prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater than `sm`, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater than `bm`, or "Draw" if they are equal.**
