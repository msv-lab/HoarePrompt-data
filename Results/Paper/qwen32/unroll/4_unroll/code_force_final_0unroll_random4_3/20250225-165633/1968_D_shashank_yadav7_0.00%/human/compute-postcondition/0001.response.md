The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is the loop control variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range(t)` function.

Given that `t` is already described as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The state of `i` does not need to be specified before the loop starts, as it will be set by the `for` loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is not specified before the loop starts**
