Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the game rules and determining the winner as described in the problem statement.

1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the scores for both players. The scores should be updated by adding the value of `a` at the current position for each turn. However, the code incorrectly adds `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` which does not align with the rules of the game.
   - The logic `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is incorrect because it does not properly accumulate the scores for each turn. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize the score in a way that is not specified in the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Position Update**:
   - The code updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`. This is correct in terms of moving to the next position as specified in the permutation. However, the issue arises from the incorrect score calculation logic that depends on these positions.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, but the game should run exactly `k` turns. The loop should run `k` times instead of `n` times. This discrepancy could lead to incorrect results, especially when `k` is less than `n`.

4. **Incorrect Initialization**:
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. This is correct. However, the initial total scores `sm` and `bm` are set to `a[s] * k` and `a[b] * k`, which is incorrect. The scores should be initialized to `a[s]` and `a[b]` and then updated in each turn.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when `k=0` (no turns are played), or when the starting positions are the same (`P_B == P_S`).

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
- Consider the following input:
  ```
  1
  3 2 1 1
  2 3 1
  5 5 5
  ```
- The correct output should be `Draw` because both players start at the same position and the scores will be the same after 2 turns.
- However, the program might not handle this case correctly due to the incorrect score calculation logic.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the answer is **False**.
