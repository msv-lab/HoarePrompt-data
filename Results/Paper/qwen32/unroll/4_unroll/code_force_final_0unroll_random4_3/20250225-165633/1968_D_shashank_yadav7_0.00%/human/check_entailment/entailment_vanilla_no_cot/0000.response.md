Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several logical errors and inefficiencies that make it incorrect for the problem as described. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The scores should be updated by adding the value of `a` at the current position on each turn, but the current implementation incorrectly uses `max` and accumulates scores in a way that doesn't reflect the game rules.
   - Specifically, `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. These lines do not correctly simulate the scoring process as described in the problem.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, but it should run `k` times because the game lasts for `k` turns.
   - Additionally, the loop decrements `k` inside the loop, which is unnecessary if the loop runs `k` times.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - The initial scores are correctly set to `a[b]` and `a[s]`, but they are not updated correctly in the loop.

4. **Position Updates**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, but the scores are not updated correctly.

To fix these issues, the program should be updated to correctly simulate the game for `k` turns, updating the scores by adding the value of `a` at the current position on each turn, and correctly comparing the final scores after `k` turns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[p[b] - 1]
            sp += a[p[s] - 1]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the scores are updated correctly for each turn and that the final scores are compared accurately to determine the winner.
