To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s` are read from the input.
   - The lists `p` and `a` are also read from the input.
   - `b` and `s` are decremented by 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `sp` is initialized to `a[s]`.
   - `bp` is initialized to `a[b]`.
   - `bm` is initialized to `a[b] * k`.
   - `sm` is initialized to `a[s] * k`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, but it breaks early if `k` reaches 0.
   - In each iteration:
     - `k` is decremented by 1.
     - `b` and `s` are updated to the indices pointed to by `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively.
     - `bm` and `sm` are updated based on the maximum of their current values and the new calculated values involving `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`.
     - `sp` and `bp` are incremented by `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, `bm` and `sm` are compared.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, "Bodya" is printed.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, "Sasha" is printed.
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, "Draw" is printed.

**Output State:**

The output state after all the iterations of the loop will be a series of strings ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw") printed for each test case, based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm` after processing all the iterations for that test case.

Since the problem does not specify the exact input values, we cannot provide a specific numerical output state. However, we can describe the state in terms of the output strings that will be printed.

Output State: **A series of strings ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw") for each test case based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm`.**
