You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that there are `n` islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can reach starting from island 1.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit after Dominater optimally destroys up to `k` bridges.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Connectivity**: Initially, all islands are connected, meaning Everule can reach all `n` islands.

2. **Dominater's Action**: Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges. To minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, Dominater should aim to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1.

3. **Minimum Reachable Islands**:
   - If `k >= n - 1`, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands. This is because to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Dominater needs to destroy at least `n - 1` bridges (one bridge to each of the other `n - 1` islands). Thus, Everule can only reach island 1.
   - If `k < n - 1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. Therefore, Everule can still reach at least `n - k` islands (including island 1).

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program to see if it aligns with the above observations:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
```

- **Logic**:
  - If `k >= n - 1`, the program correctly outputs `1`, indicating that Everule can only reach island 1.
  - If `k < n - 1`, the program outputs `n - 1`. However, this is incorrect. It should output `n - k` because that is the minimum number of islands Everule can still reach.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k < n - 1` properly. It should output `n - k` instead of `n - 1` in that scenario.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
