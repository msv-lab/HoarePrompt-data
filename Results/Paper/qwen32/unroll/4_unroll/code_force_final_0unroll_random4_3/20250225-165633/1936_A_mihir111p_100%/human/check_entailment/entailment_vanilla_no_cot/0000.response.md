Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` for Comparisons:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \). However, the program is not correctly using this function to determine the maximum XOR value.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if \( (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) \), then \(a\) or \(b\) must be part of the pair with maximum XOR, which is not necessarily the case.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The program first tries to find an index `ans1` that has a relatively large bitwise OR value when compared to other indices. This is a good start, but it does not guarantee that `ans1` will be part of the pair with maximum XOR.
   - The program then tries to find other indices that have the same bitwise OR value as `ans1` and compares their pairwise XOR values. However, the logic for comparing these XOR values is flawed. Specifically, the program compares \( (p_{\text{ans}} \mid p_{\text{ans}}) \) and \( (p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]}) \), which will always be equal (since \( p_a \mid p_a = p_a \)), leading to incorrect conclusions.

3. **Lack of Proper XOR Comparison:**
   - The program does not directly compare the XOR values of different pairs. Instead, it relies on the bitwise OR comparisons, which do not provide enough information to determine the maximum XOR.

To fix the program, a more robust approach is needed to directly compare the XOR values of different pairs. One possible approach is to use a divide-and-conquer strategy or a more systematic way to explore potential pairs, ensuring that the maximum XOR value is found within the allowed number of queries.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.
