Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` within the range from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) and returns the result of a user-provided comparison between the bitwise OR of the elements at indices `a` and `b` in a secret permutation and the bitwise OR of the elements at indices `c` and `d`.**
