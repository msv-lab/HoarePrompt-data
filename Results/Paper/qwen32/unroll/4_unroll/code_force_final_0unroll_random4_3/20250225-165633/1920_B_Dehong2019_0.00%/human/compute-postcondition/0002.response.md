The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a placeholder for the loop variable, and `t` which is the number of iterations. Since `_` is just a placeholder, we don't need to adjust it. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value within this range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
