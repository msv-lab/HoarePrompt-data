### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is a good start because it allows us to easily identify the largest elements, which Alice might want to keep, and the smallest (most negative) elements, which Bob might want to flip.

2. **Initial Calculation (`ans1`):**
   - `ans1` is initialized to the sum of all elements in the array. This represents the scenario where Alice does not remove any elements, and Bob flips the `x` largest elements (since the array is sorted in descending order, these would be the first `x` elements).

3. **Adjusting for Bob's Moves:**
   - The loop `for i in range(x): ans1 -= a[i] * 2` adjusts `ans1` to account for Bob flipping the first `x` elements. Since these elements are the largest in the sorted array, flipping them would reduce the sum by twice their value (once because they are removed from the positive sum and once because they are added back as negative values).

4. **Considering Alice's Moves:**
   - The variable `ans2` is set to `ans1`, representing the scenario where Alice does not remove any elements.
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` considers the impact of Alice removing the `i`-th largest element. For each removal:
     - `ans1` is adjusted by adding back the `i`-th element (since it is no longer removed).
     - If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` (since Bob can flip this element, reducing the sum).
     - The maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` is stored in `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:

- **Incorrect Handling of Alice's Moves:**
  - The logic for `ans1` and `ans2` is flawed. Specifically, the adjustment for Bob's moves after Alice removes an element is not correctly implemented.
  - The code does not correctly account for the optimal strategy where Alice might remove the smallest elements (after sorting in descending order) and Bob might flip the smallest remaining elements.

### Correct Approach:

- **Sort the Array:**
  - Sort the array in ascending order to easily identify the smallest elements.
  
- **Alice's Moves:**
  - Alice should remove the `k` smallest elements to maximize the sum.
  
- **Bob's Moves:**
  - After Alice's moves, Bob should flip the smallest `x` elements to minimize the sum.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips the x smallest elements
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        ans = sum(a)
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
