Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Here's a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array by removing at most `k` elements. The current implementation does not correctly handle this. It simply subtracts the `x` largest elements multiplied by 2 from the total sum, which is not optimal for Alice's goal.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array by multiplying at most `x` elements by -1. The current implementation does not correctly handle this either. It only considers flipping the `x` largest elements, which is not necessarily optimal.

3. **Combining Strategies**: The program does not correctly combine the strategies of Alice and Bob. It should consider all possible ways Alice can remove `k` elements and then determine the best way for Bob to flip `x` elements to minimize the resulting sum.

Here's a more correct approach:

- Sort the array.
- Consider all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).
- For each case, calculate the sum after Alice's removal.
- Then, determine the best way for Bob to flip `x` elements to minimize the resulting sum.
- Keep track of the maximum sum obtained after both players have played optimally.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        ans = float('-inf')
        
        for i in range(k + 1):
            # Alice removes i elements
            remaining = a[i:]
            if len(remaining) > x:
                # Bob flips the x smallest elements
                remaining[:x] = [-val for val in remaining[:x]]
            ans = max(ans, sum(remaining))
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that both players play optimally by considering all possible scenarios for Alice's removal and Bob's flips.
