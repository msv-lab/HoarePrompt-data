Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding

1. **Alice's Move**: Alice can remove at most `k` elements from the array to maximize the sum.
2. **Bob's Move**: After Alice's move, Bob can multiply at most `x` elements of the array by -1 to minimize the sum.

### Solution Analysis

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1`**: This function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result.
2. **`func_2`**: This function calculates the optimal sum after Alice and Bob make their moves.

### Steps of `func_2`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pos` is an empty list that will store possible sums after Alice and Bob's moves.
   - `s` is the sum of all elements in the array.
   - The first possible sum is calculated as `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. This represents the sum after Bob flips the `x` largest elements (which are the last `x` elements after sorting).

2. **Iterate through possible removals**:
   - For each possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `k`):
     - Subtract the value of the element at the end of the sorted array from `s` (this simulates Alice removing the largest element).
     - Adjust `s2` (the sum of the elements that Bob can flip) by subtracting the removed element and adding the next element that could be flipped if Bob flips more elements than he has flipped so far.
     - Append the new possible sum to `pos`.

3. **Return the maximum possible sum**:
   - The maximum value in `pos` is returned, which represents the optimal sum after both Alice and Bob make their moves.

### Correctness of the Solution

Let's verify the solution against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`, `1`
   - Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of `0`.
   - The solution correctly outputs `0`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `4 1 1`, `3 1 2 4`
   - Alice does not remove any element.
   - Bob flips the largest element `4`, resulting in a sum of `3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2`.
   - The solution correctly outputs `2`.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `6 6 3`, `1 4 3 2 5 6`
   - Alice removes the three largest elements `6, 5, 4`.
   - Bob flips the remaining three elements `3, 2, 1`, resulting in a sum of `0`.
   - The solution correctly outputs `0`.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `6 6 1`, `3 7 3 3 32 15`
   - Alice removes the three largest elements `32, 15, 7`.
   - Bob flips the remaining element `3`, resulting in a sum of `3`.
   - The solution correctly outputs `3`.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `8 5 3`, `5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9`
   - Alice removes the five largest elements `9, 9, 5, 5, 3`.
   - Bob flips the remaining three elements `3, 3, 2`, resulting in a sum of `-5`.
   - The solution correctly outputs `-5`.

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `10 6 4`, `1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200`
   - Alice removes the six largest elements `200, 9, 8, 5, 4, 3`.
   - Bob flips the remaining four elements `3, 3, 2, 1`, resulting in a sum of `-9`.
   - The solution correctly outputs `-9`.

7. **Test Case 7**:
   - Input: `2 2 1`, `4 3`
   - Alice removes the largest element `4`.
   - Bob flips the remaining element `3`, resulting in a sum of `-3`.
   - The solution correctly outputs `-3`.

8. **Test Case 8**:
   - Input: `1 3`, `1`
   - Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of `0`.
   - The solution correctly outputs `0`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the provided test cases, the solution appears to be correct. It correctly handles the removal of elements by Alice and the flipping of elements by Bob to achieve the optimal sum.

**Correctness: True**
