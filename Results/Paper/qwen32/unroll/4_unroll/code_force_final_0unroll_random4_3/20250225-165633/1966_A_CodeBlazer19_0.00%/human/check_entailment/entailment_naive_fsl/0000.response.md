Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always outputs `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the input values. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left after performing the described operations depends on the distribution of card numbers and not just on the value of `k`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
2

This specific example happens to work, but let's consider another one:
Input:
1
5 3
1 1 1 1 1

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
2

This also happens to work, but let's consider a case where the program will fail:
Input:
1
4 2
1 1 2 2

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
1

Explanation:
For the input 4 2 1 1 2 2, you can perform the following operations:
1. Choose two 1's and replace them with one card of any number. Now you have [1, 2, 2, x] (where x can be any number).
2. Choose two 2's and replace them with one card of any number. Now you have [1, x, y] (where x and y can be any numbers).

So, the minimum number of cards left is 2, but the program would output 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards for all possible inputs.
