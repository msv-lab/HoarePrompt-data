The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. However, the provided code snippet only deals with reading one integer value and assigning it to `x`. Therefore, the value of `t` and the conditions related to `X` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the integer value read from the input.**
