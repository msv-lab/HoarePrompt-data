The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `subseq_lens`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `x` which are described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the integer value read from the input; `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**
