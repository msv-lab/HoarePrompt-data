Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We have three friends with scores p1, p2, and p3, where p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.
- Each game results in either 2 points to the winner, 1 point each in case of a draw, or 0 points to the loser.
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have resulted in these scores.
- If the scores can't be achieved through a valid set of games, we should print -1.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Points**: The sum of all points (p1 + p2 + p3) must be even because each game results in either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw).
2. **Score Constraints**: 
    - If p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, then the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2. This is because the highest score (p3) could have been achieved by drawing with both other players (giving 1 point each) and winning against the player with the lowest score (giving 2 points).
    - If p3 is less than p1 + p2, we need to find the maximum number of draws that can fit the scores. This involves finding a balance where the points can be distributed correctly.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the scores p1, p2, and p3.
2. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints -1 because it's impossible to achieve odd total points with the given scoring rules.
3. **Direct Case (p3 ≥ p1 + p2)**: If p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, the program prints p1 + p2 as the maximum number of draws.
4. **Iterative Case (p3 < p1 + p2)**: If p3 is less than p1 + p2, the program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of x and y (representing the number of games where p1 and p2 lost respectively) and checks if the remaining points can be distributed correctly. If a valid distribution is found, it prints the total number of draws.

### Verification:
The program seems to correctly handle all the cases as per the problem description. It checks the total points condition, handles the direct case where p3 is large enough, and iteratively finds the solution for the more complex case. The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
