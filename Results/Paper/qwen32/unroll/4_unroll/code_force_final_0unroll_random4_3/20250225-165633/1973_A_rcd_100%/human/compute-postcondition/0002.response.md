To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does with each test case. The loop processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players. The loop performs the following operations for each test case:

1. Checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
2. If the sum of the scores is even, it checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2` and moves to the next test case.
3. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, it initializes `x` to `0` and `y` to `p3`. It then enters a while loop where it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop. If false, it increments `x` by `1` and decrements `y` by `1`. If the loop ends without finding a valid pair `(x, y)`, it prints `p3`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are re-assigned for each iteration, the state of these variables at the end of the loop will be the values of the last test case processed. However, the output state we are asked for is not about the final values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` but rather the output produced by the loop for all test cases.

Given that the input-output behavior of the loop is determined by the input values and the logic of the loop, and since the loop does not modify any global state outside of the loop variables, the "output state" can be described as the sequence of outputs produced by the loop for all test cases.

However, since the problem asks for the output state in a specific format and we are not provided with specific input values, we can describe the output state in terms of what the loop does:

Output State: **A sequence of outputs for each test case, where each output is either `-1`, `p1 + p2`, or a value derived from the while loop logic as described.**

Since the exact sequence of outputs depends on the input values, we cannot provide a concrete sequence without specific input values. But the format of the output state is as described above.

If we assume the problem is asking for a general description of the final state of the variables involved in the loop at the end of all iterations, it would be the state of the last test case processed. But the problem specifically asks for the output state, which is the sequence of outputs.

Therefore, the final answer in the required format is:

Output State: **A sequence of outputs for each test case, where each output is either `-1`, `p1 + p2`, or a value derived from the while loop logic as described.**
