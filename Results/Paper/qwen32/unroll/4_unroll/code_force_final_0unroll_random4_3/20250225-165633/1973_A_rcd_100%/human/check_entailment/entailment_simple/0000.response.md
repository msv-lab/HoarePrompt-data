### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players in chess games. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and the program processes multiple test cases. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The number of test cases `t` is read first. For each test case, the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are read.

2. **Total Points Check**: The sum of all scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is checked to see if it is even. This is because each game either results in 2 points being awarded (one player wins) or 2 points being awarded (both players draw). Hence, the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.

3. **Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores. The maximum number of draws in this scenario is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score `p3` could be obtained by `p3 - (p1 + p2)` wins and `p1 + p2` draws.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to `p3`. The idea is to find a balance between the points `p1` and `p2` after accounting for draws. The loop iterates while `y` (initially `p3`) is greater than or equal to `x` (initially 0). If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` holds true, it means a valid distribution of points is found, and the maximum number of draws is `p1 - x + p3`. If no such balance is found, the loop ends, and the maximum number of draws defaults to `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), where one player has a significantly higher score (`p1 + p2 < p3`), and where scores are evenly distributed among the players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores and handles various edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
