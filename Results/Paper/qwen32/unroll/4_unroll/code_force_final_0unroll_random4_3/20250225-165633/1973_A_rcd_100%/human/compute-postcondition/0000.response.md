The code snippet provided only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state includes `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` as sorted scores of three players, and `t` as the number of test cases. The code does not affect `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` directly; it only assigns a value to `t`.

Output State: **Each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and `t` is assigned the value of the input integer.**
