Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are inconsistent. There are a few issues with the logic:

1. The condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` is incorrect. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it does not necessarily mean that the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. Instead, it should be checked if the scores are achievable with the given constraints.

2. The while loop logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program attempts to find a valid combination of wins and draws that sums up to the given scores, but it does not correctly account for all possible scenarios.

3. The `else` block after the while loop is incorrect. If no valid combination is found, the program should print `-1` instead of `p3`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        max_draws = min(p1, p2, p3)
        min_draws = (p2 + p3 - 2 * p1) // 2 if p2 + p3 - 2 * p1 >= 0 else 0
        if p1 + p2 < p3:
            print(-1)
        elif p1 + p2 == p3:
            print(p1)
        else:
            if min_draws <= max_draws:
                print(max_draws)
            else:
                print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the maximum possible number of draws and checks for inconsistencies in the scores.
