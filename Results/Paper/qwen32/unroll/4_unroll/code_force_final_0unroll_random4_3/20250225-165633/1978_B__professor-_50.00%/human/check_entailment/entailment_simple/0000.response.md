To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and the conditions provided in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis

Bob's profit depends on the strategy he chooses for selling the buns. He can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1` and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

**Objective:** Maximize the profit.

### Conditions and Strategy

1. **If `b <= a`:**
   - Selling at the modified price would not increase the profit because the price of the first bun (`b`) is less than or equal to the usual price (`a`).
   - Therefore, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Profit: `n * a`.

2. **If `b - a >= n`:**
   - This means that the difference between the modified price of the first bun and the usual price is large enough to cover all buns.
   - In this case, Bob can sell all `n` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`.
   - The profit is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`.
   - Sum of series: `S = (n/2) * (first_term + last_term) = (n/2) * (b + (b - n + 1)) = (n/2) * (2b - n + 1)`.
   - Profit: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.

3. **Otherwise (`b - a < n`):**
   - Here, the difference between the modified price and the usual price is not enough to cover all buns.
   - Bob should sell as many buns as possible at the modified price until the price drops to `a`.
   - The number of buns sold at the modified price is `k = b - a`.
   - The profit from these `k` buns is the sum of the series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
   - Sum of series: `S = (k/2) * (first_term + last_term) = (k/2) * (b + (b - k + 1)) = (k/2) * (2b - k + 1)`.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Profit from remaining buns: `(n - k) * a`.
   - Total profit: `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

### Program Analysis

The given program correctly implements the above logic:

- **Case 1:** `if b <= a` → `print(n * a)`
- **Case 2:** `elif b - a >= n` → `print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))`
- **Case 3:** `else` → `print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))`

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the conditions and calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

**Correctness:** **True**
