The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state specifies the constraints for these variables, which remain valid after the code execution. The only change is that the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are now assigned specific values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned specific values from the input.**
