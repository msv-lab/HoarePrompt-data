Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Introverts (a)**:
   - Each introvert must be in a tent by themselves.
   - Therefore, `a` tents are required for introverts.

2. **Extroverts (b)**:
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - So, `b` extroverts need `ceil(b/3)` tents because each tent can hold 3 extroverts.

3. **Universals (c)**:
   - They can be placed in any tent configuration.
   - They can fill in any remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents if needed.

### Conditions for Valid Configuration

- If `b % 3 != 0` (i.e., the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3), there will be some extroverts left over who can't form a complete group of 3.
- In this case, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill in the remaining spots.
  - For each incomplete group of extroverts, we need at least `3 - (b % 3)` universals.
  - If `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means we can't form a valid group for the remaining extroverts, and the configuration is impossible.

### Code Analysis

Let's examine the provided functions:

#### Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`

- This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- It checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0` and if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with universals.
  - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None`, indicating an impossible configuration.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

#### Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`

- This function calculates the total number of tents needed for all participants.
- It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None` (indicating an impossible configuration), it returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`) to the result from `func_1`.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly handles the logic described above. It checks for impossible configurations and calculates the minimum number of tents needed when possible.

**Correctness: True**
