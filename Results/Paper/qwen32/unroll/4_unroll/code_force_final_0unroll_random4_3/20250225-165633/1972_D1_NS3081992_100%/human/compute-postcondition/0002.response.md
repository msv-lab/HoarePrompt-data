The given code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_7()` and are both positive integers within the specified range. The variable `i` also remains unchanged as it is initialized to 1 in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and both are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1; `ans` is 0.**
