The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer, which means it can be any integer value. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `T` must be a non-zero value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is a non-zero integer**
