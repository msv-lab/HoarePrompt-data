The code snippet appends the value `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Here, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `elements`, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`. The variables `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and it is not the case that `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. The list `pos` was initially empty.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). It is not the case that `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is a list containing one element, which is `s - 2 * n`. `s` is the sum of `elements`. `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**
