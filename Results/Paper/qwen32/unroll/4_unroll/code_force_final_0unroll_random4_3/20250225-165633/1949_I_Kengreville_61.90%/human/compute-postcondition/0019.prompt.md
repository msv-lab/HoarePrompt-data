You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk such that -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of boolean and integer values respectively, initialized to False and None, of length n. nodes is a list that will be used to store indices during the execution of the function.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: `visited` is a list of `True` values, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers modified by `dfs`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` if any `c1` is not `0`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `visited` is a list of `True` values, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers modified by `dfs`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is `True` if there is at least one `c1` that is not `0`; otherwise, `ok` is `False` because all `c1` values are `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but operates on the global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. It processes `n` disks defined by their centers `(x[i], y[i])` and radii `r[i]`, and uses the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists to manage the state and results of the processing. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists as part of its operation.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
