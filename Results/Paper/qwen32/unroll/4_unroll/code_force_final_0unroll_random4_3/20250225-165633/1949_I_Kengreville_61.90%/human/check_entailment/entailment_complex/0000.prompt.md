Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk such that -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of boolean and integer values respectively, initialized to False and None, of length n. nodes is a list that will be used to store indices during the execution of the function.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n

    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []

            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: `visited` is a list of `True` values, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers modified by `dfs`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` if any `c1` is not `0`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :

        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `visited` is a list of `True` values, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers modified by `dfs`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is `True` if there is at least one `c1` that is not `0`; otherwise, `ok` is `False` because all `c1` values are `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` disks, each defined by its center coordinates `(x[i], y[i])` and radius `r[i]`. It processes these disks to determine if there is at least one disk that can be part of a specific configuration (as determined by the `dfs` function, which is not shown in the provided code). The function prints 'YES' if such a configuration exists, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function modifies the global lists `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` during its execution but does not return any value explicitly.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk. visited, nodes, coef0, and coef1 are lists used to keep track of visited disks, nodes in the current DFS traversal, coefficients for radius adjustments, and their signs, respectively. n is the total number of disks.
def dfs(i):
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True

        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]

        #State: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk. `visited[j]` is `True` for disks `j` that are reachable from disk `i` through the condition satisfied in the loop, and `False` otherwise. `nodes` is a list that includes `i` and possibly other disks that were visited during the DFS traversal. `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated for disks `j` that meet the condition in the loop, with `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`. `n` is the total number of disks.
    #State: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[j]` is `True` for disks `j` that are reachable from disk `i` through the condition satisfied in the loop, and `False` otherwise. `nodes` includes `i` and possibly other disks that were visited during the DFS traversal. `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated for disks `j` that meet the condition in the loop, with `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`. `n` is the total number of disks.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a disk at index `i`. It updates the `visited` list to mark disks that are reachable from disk `i`, adds these disks to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the radius and position conditions. The function modifies these lists in place but does not return any value.
