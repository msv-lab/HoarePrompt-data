Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk. `visited[i]` is now `True`, indicating that the i-th disk has been visited. `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are lists used to keep track of nodes in the current DFS traversal, coefficients for radius adjustments, and their signs, respectively. `n` is the total number of disks.**

In simpler terms, the i-th disk has been marked as visited, while all other variables retain their previous states.
