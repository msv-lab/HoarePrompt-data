### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine whether we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The provided program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the connectivity of the disks based on their tangency. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and their respective coordinates `(x_i, y_i)` and radii `r_i`.
   - It initializes lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to keep track of visited disks, coefficients for radius adjustments, and their signs, respectively.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - For each unvisited disk, the program starts a DFS traversal.
   - During the traversal, for each pair of disks `(i, j)` that are tangent (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii), the program updates the coefficients for adjusting the radii of the disks.
   - Specifically, if disks `i` and `j` are tangent, the program sets `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`. This ensures that the adjusted radii maintain tangency and the sum of the radii can potentially decrease.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After the DFS traversal, the program calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for each connected component of disks.
   - If any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`, it means that the radii can be adjusted in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.
   - If all connected components have a sum of `coef1` equal to zero, then it is not possible to adjust the radii to meet the required conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `YES` if any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program is sound. The DFS traversal correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks and calculates the necessary coefficients to adjust the radii. The condition for checking feasibility (i.e., whether the sum of `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component) is correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
