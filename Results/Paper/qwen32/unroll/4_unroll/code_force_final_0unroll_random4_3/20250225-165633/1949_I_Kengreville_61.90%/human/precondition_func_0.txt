n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk such that -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of boolean and integer values respectively, initialized to False and None, of length n. nodes is a list that will be used to store indices during the execution of the function.
