### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of the given disks in such a way that they remain tangent to each other, do not overlap, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases. The approach involves a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the connectivity of the disks based on tangency conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of disks `n` is read.
   - For each disk, its center coordinates `(x[i], y[i])` and radius `r[i]` are read and stored in respective lists.

2. **DFS Initialization:**
   - Lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to keep track of visited disks, coefficients for radius adjustments, and their signs, respectively.
   - The `dfs` function is called for each unvisited disk to explore all connected disks.

3. **DFS Execution:**
   - For each disk `i`, if it hasn't been visited, it is marked as visited and added to the `nodes` list.
   - For each other disk `j`, if it hasn't been visited and is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii), the coefficients `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated based on the tangency condition, and `dfs(j)` is called recursively.

4. **Coefficient Check:**
   - After processing all disks, the code checks if there is at least one disk for which the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero. If such a disk exists, it implies that the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's conditions, and the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:

- **Tangency Condition:** The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if disks `i` and `j` are tangent. This is correct based on the Euclidean distance formula.
- **Coefficient Update:** The updates to `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are designed to ensure that the radii can be adjusted while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions. The logic seems correct for this purpose.
- **DFS Traversal:** The DFS traversal ensures that all connected disks are processed, which is necessary for correctly determining the feasibility of adjusting the radii.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted as per the problem's requirements. The DFS traversal and coefficient updates are consistent with the problem's constraints and conditions.

Thus, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
