Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` disks, each defined by its center coordinates `(x[i], y[i])` and radius `r[i]`. It processes these disks to determine if there is at least one disk that can be part of a specific configuration (as determined by the `dfs` function, which is not shown in the provided code). The function prints 'YES' if such a configuration exists, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function modifies the global lists `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` during its execution but does not return any value explicitly.**
