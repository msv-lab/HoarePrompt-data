You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n

        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)

            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]

            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:

def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a disk at index `i`. It updates the `visited` list to mark disks that are reachable from disk `i`, adds these disks to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the radius and position conditions. The function modifies these lists in place but does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Global Variables**: The `dfs` function uses variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` which are defined in the `func_1` function. However, these variables are not passed as parameters to `dfs`, and they are not declared as global within `dfs`. This will lead to a `NameError` because `dfs` cannot access these variables.

2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS logic is intended to check if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining the tangency conditions. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the logic for adjusting the radii. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to track the adjustments, but the logic for ensuring that the sum of radii decreases is not correctly implemented.

3. **Condition for Tangency**: The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. However, the logic for adjusting the radii based on this condition is not correctly implemented in the DFS function.

4. **Output Logic**: The `ok` variable is set to `True` if `c1 != 0` for any connected component of disks. This logic does not correctly determine whether it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
2
0 0 1
2 0 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
In this example, the two disks are tangent to each other. We can decrease the radius of both disks by 0.5, resulting in two disks with radius 0.5 that are still tangent to each other, and the sum of the radii decreases from 2 to 1.

However, the provided code will likely output `NO` for this input because the logic for adjusting the radii is not correctly implemented.

To fix the code, the DFS function needs to correctly handle the logic for adjusting the radii and ensuring that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. The current implementation does not achieve this correctly.
