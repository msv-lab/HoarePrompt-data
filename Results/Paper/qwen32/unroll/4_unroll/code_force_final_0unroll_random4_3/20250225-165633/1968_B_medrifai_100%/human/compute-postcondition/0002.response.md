Output State: **The program returns the value of `j` plus the value of `index`, where `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from position `j`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the position in `b` where the character `a[i]` is first found, starting the search from position `j` in `b`.
