t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function `func_1` is called with a, b, i, and j, where i and j are indices representing the current position in strings a and b, respectively.
