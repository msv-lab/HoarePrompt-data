Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two integer indices `i` and `j`. It returns the value of `j` plus the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from position `j` if `a[i]` is found. If `a[i]` is not found in the substring, it returns -1.**
