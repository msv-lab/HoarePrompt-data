The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates and prints an integer `k` for each test case, which is determined based on the matching characters between the strings `a` and `b`.
