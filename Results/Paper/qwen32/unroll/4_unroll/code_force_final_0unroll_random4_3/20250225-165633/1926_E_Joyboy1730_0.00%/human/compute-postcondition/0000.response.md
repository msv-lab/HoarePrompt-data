Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.**

In this output state, `t` has been updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which is guaranteed to be within the range 1 to 50,000. The preconditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input.
