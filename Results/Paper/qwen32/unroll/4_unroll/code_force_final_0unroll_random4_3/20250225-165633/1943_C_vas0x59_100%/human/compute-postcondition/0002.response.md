The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute because `n - 1` will be at least 1, making the range non-empty.

Before the loop starts, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists. This state does not affect whether the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
