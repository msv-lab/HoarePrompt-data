The given code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The variables `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, and `previous` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `b` will be the same as the value of `a` because both `a` and `b` are the result of `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the outer list; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as updated by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
