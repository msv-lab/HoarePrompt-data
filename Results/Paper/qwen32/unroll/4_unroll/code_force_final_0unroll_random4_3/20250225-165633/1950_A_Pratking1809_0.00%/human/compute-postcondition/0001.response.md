The provided code snippet only initializes the variable `mn` with the value 100. It does not affect any other variables or perform any operations involving `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `q` is an input integer; `mn` is 100.**
