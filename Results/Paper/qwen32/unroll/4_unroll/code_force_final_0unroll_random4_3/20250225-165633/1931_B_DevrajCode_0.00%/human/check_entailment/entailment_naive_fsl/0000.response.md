Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and assumes that the first value is the number of test cases `t`, followed by the values for the first test case. However, the input format specifies that each test case has its own `n` and `a_i` values, and this pattern repeats for all test cases. The current implementation does not correctly parse multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError`.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**: The logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect. The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level ever goes negative, which is not a correct approach to determine if the water can be evenly distributed using the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys

def can_distribute_evenly(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(can_distribute_evenly(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

In this corrected version:
- The program correctly reads and processes each test case separately.
- The function `can_distribute_evenly` is defined before it is used.
- The logic checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level ever goes negative, which is still incorrect for the problem. However, the problem can be solved by checking if the prefix sum of the differences is always non-negative, which is what the original logic attempts to do but needs to be correctly implemented.

However, the original logic is still incorrect because it does not fully capture the requirements of the problem. The correct approach is to ensure that at no point does the cumulative difference of water levels (after adjusting for the target) go negative, which is what the original logic attempts but fails to do correctly for all cases. A correct implementation would need to ensure that the water can be distributed in a way that respects the constraints of the problem.

Given the original program's logic and input handling issues, the correctness is **False**.
