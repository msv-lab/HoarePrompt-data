The code calculates the `target` by dividing `total_water` by `n`. Given that `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` will be the integer result of this division.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `total_water % n` is equal to 0; `target` is `total_water // n`.**
