Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`. For each test case, the function performs an unspecified computation and returns a result. The constraints ensure that the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10,000, and for each test case, both `n` and `m` are between 1 and 2,000,000. The sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2,000,000.**
