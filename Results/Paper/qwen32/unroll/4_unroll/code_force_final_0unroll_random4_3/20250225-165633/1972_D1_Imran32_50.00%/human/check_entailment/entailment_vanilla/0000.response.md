Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program does not seem to implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

#### Issues with the Program

1. **Variable Naming**: The variable `k` is used instead of `m`. This suggests that the input reading part is incorrect.
2. **Logic**: The core logic of the program seems to be counting something related to divisors or multiples, but it does not directly address the given problem's conditions.
3. **Loop and Calculation**: The loop and the calculations inside do not match the problem's requirements. The program is not checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
import math

def count_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_pairs(n, m))
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
