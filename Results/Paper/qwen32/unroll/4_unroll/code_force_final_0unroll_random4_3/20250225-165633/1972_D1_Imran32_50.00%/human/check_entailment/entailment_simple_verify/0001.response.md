### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis

The provided program does not seem to implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

#### Issues with the Program

1. **Variable Naming**: The variable `k` is used instead of `m`. This suggests that the input reading part is incorrect.
2. **Logic**: The core logic of the program seems to be counting something related to divisors or multiples, but it does not directly address the given problem's conditions.
3. **Loop and Calculation**: The loop and the calculations inside do not match the problem's requirements. The program is not checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code

The annotated version of the code provides insights into the state of the program at various points:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6; `ans` is the result of `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2)); `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2))
```

The annotations confirm that the program is not checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it is performing a different calculation that does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
import math

def count_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_pairs(n, m))
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
