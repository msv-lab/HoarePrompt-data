The code snippet provided defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning a list of these integers. This lambda function does not modify any existing variables or introduce new ones that are not defined within its scope. The initial state describes a context involving a permutation and queries, but the lambda function itself does not interact with these elements.

Output State: **The lambda function `I` is defined to read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each split string to an integer, and return a list of these integers. The initial state regarding the permutation and queries remains unchanged.**
