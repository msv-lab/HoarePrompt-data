The function interacts with a system to determine two indices `i` and `j` of a secret permutation `p` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. It sends up to 3n queries per test case in the form "? a b c d" to receive comparisons of bitwise OR operations on elements of the permutation. The function outputs the indices `i` and `j` that maximize `p_i âŠ• p_j`.
