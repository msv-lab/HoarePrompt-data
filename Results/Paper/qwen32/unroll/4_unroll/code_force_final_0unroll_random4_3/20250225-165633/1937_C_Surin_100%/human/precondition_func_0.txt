The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), representing the length of a secret permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interact with the system by sending queries in the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving responses "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of bitwise OR operations on elements of the permutation. The function must find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries per test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
