You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), representing the length of a secret permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interact with the system by sending queries in the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving responses "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of bitwise OR operations on elements of the permutation. The function must find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries per test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
            elif r == '=':
                print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
                sys.stdout.flush()
                r2 = input('')
                if r2 == '<':
                    prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: The variables `v1` and `prev` will hold the two largest distinct numbers for each test case. The variable `g` remains 0, and `n` holds the number of elements in the list for the current test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but interacts with a system to determine two indices i and j of a secret permutation p such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function can send up to 3n queries per test case in the form "? a b c d" to receive comparisons of bitwise OR operations on elements of the permutation. The function returns the indices i and j that maximize p_i ⊕ p_j.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
