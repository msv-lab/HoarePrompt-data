The code initializes a set called `visited` with the initial element `start`. This means that the `start` node is now marked as visited.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with n nodes; `queue` is a deque with the initial element `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**
