Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The first binary string a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n} consists of n characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'. The second binary string a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n} also consists of n characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value from the input, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as the input only affects `t`.
