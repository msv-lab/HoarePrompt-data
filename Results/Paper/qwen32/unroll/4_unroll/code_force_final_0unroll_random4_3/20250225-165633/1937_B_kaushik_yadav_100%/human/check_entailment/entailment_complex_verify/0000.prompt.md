You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions, and then determines the length of the longest contiguous segment where `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]` or `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. It outputs the constructed string `ans` and the length of this segment for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of the grasshopper needing to switch rows more than once to achieve the lexicographically smallest string.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1101
1010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1010
1
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
1101
1
```

In this example, the program starts by choosing the first element from the first row (`1`). It then continues to choose from the first row until it finds a point where switching to the second row would yield a smaller element. However, in this case, the program incorrectly continues choosing from the first row, resulting in the string `1101`, which is not the lexicographically smallest string possible. The correct path should switch to the second row at the second column to achieve the string `1010`.

The program's logic for switching rows is flawed because it only considers switching once and does not account for multiple switches that might be necessary to reach the lexicographically smallest string. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this and potentially other similar cases.
