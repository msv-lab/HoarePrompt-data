Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of the grasshopper needing to switch rows more than once to achieve the lexicographically smallest string.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1101
1010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1010
1
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
1101
1
```

In this example, the program starts by choosing the first element from the first row (`1`). It then continues to choose from the first row until it finds a point where switching to the second row would yield a smaller element. However, in this case, the program incorrectly continues choosing from the first row, resulting in the string `1101`, which is not the lexicographically smallest string possible. The correct path should switch to the second row at the second column to achieve the string `1010`.

The program's logic for switching rows is flawed because it only considers switching once and does not account for multiple switches that might be necessary to reach the lexicographically smallest string. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this and potentially other similar cases.
