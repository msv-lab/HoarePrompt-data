Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`s`**: This is a string provided by user input.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the string `s`.
3. **`x`**: This is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`. It is given that `x` is not equal to -1, meaning there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character.
4. **`i`**: This is the index of the first differing character, which is the same as `x` based on the description.
5. **`func_1(s[x + 1:])`**: This function call returns `True`. The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, but we know it returns `True` when called with the substring `s[x + 1:]`.
6. **Additional Constraints**:
   - `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, `i`, or the result of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` as it is explicitly stated in the code.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
