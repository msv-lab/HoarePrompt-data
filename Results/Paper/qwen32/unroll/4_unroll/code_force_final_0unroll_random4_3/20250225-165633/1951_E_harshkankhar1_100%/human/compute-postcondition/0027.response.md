The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function has two cases for its return behavior: Case_1, it returns `None`; Case_2, it returns nothing. However, since Case_2 returning "nothing" is not a typical behavior in Python (as not returning anything implicitly returns `None`), it can be inferred that both cases essentially mean the function returns `None`. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return `None`.

Functionality: **The function returns `None`.**
