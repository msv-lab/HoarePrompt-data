Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for partitioning the string into substrings that are not palindromes. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly account for all scenarios, particularly when the string has repeating characters and the only non-palindromic partitions are more than two parts.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program only checks for the first non-matching character and attempts to partition the string into at most two parts. This is insufficient because a string might need to be partitioned into more than two parts to avoid having palindromic substrings.
2. The program does not handle cases where the string can be partitioned into multiple small non-palindromic substrings.
3. The logic for checking and forming partitions is flawed, especially when the first character repeats and the rest of the string might still form palindromes.

For example, consider the string "aaaaa". The current program will output "NO" because it can't find a valid two-part partition, but a valid partition would be ["a", "a", "a", "a", "a"], which is not checked.

Here is a corrected version of the program that handles these cases:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input[index]
        index += 1
        n = len(s)
        if n == 1:
            results.append("NO")
            continue
        partition = []
        for i in range(n):
            if not is_palindrome(s[i:i+2]):
                partition.append(s[i:i+2])
                i += 1
            else:
                partition.append(s[i])
        if all(not is_palindrome(sub) for sub in partition):
            results.append("YES")
            results.append(str(len(partition)))
            results.append(" ".join(partition))
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    print("\n".join(results))

# Example usage:
# solve()
```

This version of the program checks for every possible partition of the string into substrings of length 1 or 2, ensuring that each substring is not a palindrome. It handles cases where more than two partitions are necessary.
