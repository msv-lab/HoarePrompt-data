You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts. The counts themselves remain unchanged after processing each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each integer being 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
- Eve removes one number after each game until the sequence is empty.
- Eve wants Bob to win as many times as possible.
- Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Breakdown:
- `a, b, c, d` represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs for each number.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is exactly one leftover of each number (1, 2, 3) after pairing, which would result in a XOR of 0.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Pairing Strategy**: The code correctly pairs each number, and each pair does not contribute to a non-zero XOR.
2. **Leftovers**: The code correctly identifies when there is exactly one leftover of each 1, 2, and 3, which would result in a XOR of 0. This is a key part of ensuring Bob wins.
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - **All numbers are paired**: In this case, the XOR is 0, and Bob wins.
    - **One leftover of each 1, 2, and 3**: The XOR is 0, and Bob wins.
    - **Other single leftovers**: The XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

### Testing with Example Cases:
1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One leftover of each 1, 2, and 3 is not possible, so Bob wins once when all numbers are paired.
2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Bob wins once when one 1 and one 3 are removed, leaving 2 and 4, which XOR to 0.
3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs optimally.
4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs optimally.
5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12`
   - Explanation: Bob wins twelve times by removing pairs optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the described cases correctly. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by pairing numbers and considering the optimal removal strategy.

Correctness: **True**.
