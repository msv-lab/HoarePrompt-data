To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented correctly computes the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Analysis

Bob wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero. Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins, which means she should try to create a situation where the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as frequently as possible.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **XOR Properties**:
    - XOR of any number with itself is 0.
    - XOR of any number with 0 is the number itself.
    - XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order does not matter.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
    - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
    - Numbers 2 and 4 do not affect the XOR result because 2 (binary 10) and 4 (binary 100) will cancel out in pairs.
    - Numbers 1 and 3 are crucial because 1 (binary 1) and 3 (binary 11) can affect the XOR result.

3. **Counting Pairs**:
    - For numbers 1 and 3, if there are an even number of each, they will cancel out, resulting in a XOR of 0.
    - If there is an odd number of 1s and 3s, the XOR will be non-zero unless the remaining number is specifically chosen to cancel out the result.

4. **Formula Derivation**:
    - For each pair of 1s or 3s, Bob wins once.
    - If there is an odd count of 1s and 3s, Bob can win one additional time if the last remaining number (either 1 or 3) is removed last.
    - Numbers 2 and 4 do not affect the XOR result, so they can be ignored for the purpose of maximizing Bob's wins.

### Program Logic
The provided program calculates:
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: Counts the number of pairs for each type of number.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: Checks if there is exactly one number of each type (1, 3) left, which would allow Bob to win one more time.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by counting the pairs and considering the leftover odd counts of 1s and 3s.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
