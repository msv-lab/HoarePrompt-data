You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: p_i (counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours remain unchanged)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally from the sequence. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0 (e.g., 1 XOR 1 = 0, 2 XOR 2 = 0).
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., 1 XOR 0 = 1).
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers is 0.
   - This can happen if pairs of the same number are removed, leaving an even count of each number or exactly three numbers with odd counts (since 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, which is non-zero, but 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 0).

3. **Eve's Optimal Strategy**:
   - Eve should aim to remove numbers such that Bob wins as many times as possible.
   - This means creating situations where the XOR of the remaining numbers is 0.

#### Strategy:
- For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), the optimal strategy is to remove numbers in pairs.
- After removing pairs, if there are exactly three numbers with odd counts, Bob can win once more.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the code provided:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

1. **Loop through Test Cases**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and iterates over each one.

2. **Read Input**:
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

3. **Calculate Bob's Wins**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This calculates the number of pairs that can be removed for each type of number, contributing to Bob's wins.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This checks if there are exactly three numbers with odd counts. If true, it adds one more win for Bob.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the strategy described above:
- It counts the number of pairs that can be removed for each type of number.
- It checks if there are exactly three numbers with odd counts to account for one more win.

Therefore, the code is correct.
