Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations is flawed.

The current implementation checks if the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, it returns `k - 1`, otherwise, it returns `n`. This approach does not account for the optimal way to reduce the number of cards by performing the operations multiple times and considering all card counts.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
6 3
1 1 1 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We start with 6 cards: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2.
- We can choose 3 cards with the number 1 and exchange them for 2 cards (of any number), leaving us with 3 cards: 1, 2, 2, 2.
- We can then choose 3 cards with the number 2 and exchange them for 2 cards, leaving us with 2 cards: 1, 2.

However, the given program will output `3 - 1 = 2` for the first exchange and then return `n` (which is 6) because the maximum count of any card number after the first exchange is not greater than or equal to `k`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iteratively perform the operations until no more operations can be performed. This involves repeatedly reducing the count of the most frequent card by `k` and adding `k-1` cards back, until the maximum count of any card is less than `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        from collections import Counter
        p = Counter(l)
        while True:
            max_count = max(p.values())
            if max_count < k:
                break
            for card in p:
                if p[card] == max_count:
                    p[card] -= k
                    p[card + 101] = p.get(card + 101, 0) + (k - 1)
                    break
        print(sum(v for v in p.values() if v > 0))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version uses a `Counter` to keep track of the counts of each card number and iteratively performs the operations until no more operations can be performed. It ensures that we always reduce the maximum count of any card and add `k-1` cards back, leading to the correct minimum number of cards left.
