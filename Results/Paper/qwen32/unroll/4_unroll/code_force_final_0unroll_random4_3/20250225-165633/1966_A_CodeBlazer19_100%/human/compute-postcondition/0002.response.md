Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case from the input. For each test case, the output is either `k - 1` if the highest frequency of any number in the list `l` is at least `k`, or `n` if no number in the list `l` appears at least `k` times. The variables `n`, `k`, and `l` are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop, but `t` remains unchanged.**
