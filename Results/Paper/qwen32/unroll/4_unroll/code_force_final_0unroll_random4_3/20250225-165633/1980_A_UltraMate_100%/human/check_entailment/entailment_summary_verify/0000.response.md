### Reasoning:

The provided program and its function summary align well with the problem description. Let's break down the logic and verify it step by step:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting the Problems**:
   - The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' (`p = 'ABCDEFG'`).
     - If a difficulty level `i` is not present in `hmp` (the count dictionary), it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level.
     - If a difficulty level `i` is present in `hmp` but the count is less than `m`, it adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to ensure there are `m` problems of that difficulty level.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Verification Against Provided Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`
     - 'A' and 'F' are missing.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Program Output: `5`
     - 'A', 'F', and 'G' are missing twice, and 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' are missing once.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`
     - 'A' is missing.

### Edge Cases Considered:

1. **When `m = 1`**:
   - The program correctly identifies the number of missing difficulties.

2. **When `n = 0`**:
   - The program correctly returns `7 * m` because all difficulties are missing.

3. **When all difficulties are present**:
   - The program correctly returns `0` additional problems needed.

### Conclusion:

After carefully analyzing the program, its logic, and the provided test cases, it is evident that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
