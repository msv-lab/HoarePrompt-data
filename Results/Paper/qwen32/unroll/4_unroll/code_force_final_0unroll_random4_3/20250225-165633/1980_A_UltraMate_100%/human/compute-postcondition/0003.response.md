Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (where `n` is the number of problems in the bank, ranging from 1 to 50, and `m` is the number of upcoming rounds, ranging from 1 to 5), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The function processes each test case independently and returns the results based on the given criteria.**
