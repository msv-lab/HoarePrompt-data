You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` will receive a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively, followed by a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The function will process each test case independently.

            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of the number of problems in a bank, the number of upcoming rounds, and a string representing the difficulties of the problems. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' is represented in at least as many problems as there are upcoming rounds.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problems**:
   - The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Problems**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It then iterates through each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
     - If a difficulty level `i` is not present in the `Counter` object `hmp` (meaning it doesn't appear in the string `s`), it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level.
     - If a difficulty level `i` is present but the count is less than `m`, it adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to account for the shortfall.
   
4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold `m` rounds.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - The program handles cases where no problems of a certain difficulty level are present in the bank by adding `m` for each missing difficulty level.
   - It also handles cases where the number of problems of a certain difficulty level is less than `m` by adding the difference to `ans`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given constraints.
