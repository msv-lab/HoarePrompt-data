The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of the number of problems in a bank, the number of upcoming rounds, and a string representing the difficulties of the problems. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' is represented in at least as many problems as there are upcoming rounds.
