The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in list `b`. The function outputs the count of such subarrays for each test case.
