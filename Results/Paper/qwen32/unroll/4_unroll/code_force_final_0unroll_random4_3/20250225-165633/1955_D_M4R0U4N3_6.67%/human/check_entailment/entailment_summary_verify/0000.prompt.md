You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

                todo.remove(a[r])
                done.add(a[r])
            else:
                extra.add(a[r])
            if len(done) >= k:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in list `b`. The function outputs the count of such subarrays for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for maintaining the count of elements that match the elements in array `b` as the sliding window moves across array `a`. The issue lies in the way the program updates the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets.

Specifically, the `todo` set is used to store elements that are still needed to match `b`, and the `done` set stores elements that have been matched. The `extra` set is used to store elements in the current window that are not needed to match `b`.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where an element that was previously in the `done` set is removed because it is no longer in the current window, and then it is added back to the `todo` set. This can cause the program to incorrectly count the number of matches.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3 2
1 2 3 1 2 3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Subsegments: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, `[3, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 3]`
- All subsegments can be rearranged to match `[1, 2, 3]` with at least 2 matching elements.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The program incorrectly counts only 3 subsegments as good.

The issue arises because the program does not correctly manage the transition of elements between the `done` and `todo` sets when the sliding window moves. Specifically, when an element is removed from the `done` set because it is no longer in the current window, it should be added back to the `todo` set only if it was originally in `b` and not already counted as a match in the current window. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To fix this, the program should maintain a count of each element in `b` and ensure that the `todo` set is updated correctly when elements are added or removed from the current window.
