You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints.
2. Constraints are of three types:
   - Type 1: \( k \geq x \)
   - Type 2: \( k \leq x \)
   - Type 3: \( k \neq x \)
3. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2.
4. No two constraints are the same.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints \( n \).
   - It then reads each constraint, which is a pair of integers (type \( a \) and value \( x \)).

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - It initializes `cx` as a set to store all values \( x \) for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000007) and `bx` to -1. These will store the maximum value for constraints of type 1 and the minimum value for constraints of type 2, respectively.
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 3, it adds \( x \) to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` (the maximum value from type 1 constraints) is greater than `ax` (the minimum value from type 2 constraints). If so, it means there is no integer \( k \) that can satisfy both types of constraints, and it appends 0 to the result list.
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints:
     - It counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and stores this count in `tmp`.
     - It then calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1` and subtracts `tmp` from it to get the number of valid \( k \) values.
     - This result is appended to the result list.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for handling constraints of types 1 and 2 is correct. It correctly identifies the range `[bx, ax]` that \( k \) must fall within.
- The logic for handling constraints of type 3 is also correct. It identifies and excludes values within the range `[bx, ax]` that should not be included.
- The edge cases, such as when `bx` is greater than `ax`, are handled correctly by returning 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
