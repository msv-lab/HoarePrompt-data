You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and returns the number of integers within a specified range that are not explicitly listed as constraints of type 3. The range is determined by the maximum value of constraints of type 1 and the minimum value of constraints of type 2.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints.
- Constraints can be:
  1. \( k \geq x \)
  2. \( k \leq x \)
  3. \( k \neq x \)
- There will be at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2.
- The answer is guaranteed to be finite.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes constraints and calculates the number of valid \( k \) values.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cx` is a set to store values that \( k \) cannot be (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large number (1000000000.0 + 7) to find the minimum \( k \) (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to find the maximum \( k \) (type 1 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax`, `bx`, or adds to `cx` based on the constraint type.

3. **Calculating Valid \( k \) Values:**
   - If `bx` (max \( k \)) is greater than `ax` (min \( k \)), it means there are no valid \( k \) values, so the answer is 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total possible values between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, subtracting the values in `cx` that fall within this range.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases and constraints correctly.

1. **Edge Case: No Overlapping Range:**
   - If the maximum \( k \) from type 1 constraints is greater than the minimum \( k \) from type 2 constraints, there are no valid \( k \) values.
   - Example: \( k \geq 5 \) and \( k \leq 4 \).

2. **Edge Case: Only One Valid \( k \) Value:**
   - If the maximum \( k \) from type 1 constraints equals the minimum \( k \) from type 2 constraints and no type 3 constraints exclude this value.
   - Example: \( k \geq 5 \) and \( k \leq 5 \).

3. **Edge Case: Multiple Type 3 Constraints:**
   - If multiple values are excluded by type 3 constraints, these should be subtracted from the total range.
   - Example: \( k \geq 1 \), \( k \leq 10 \), \( k \neq 3 \), \( k \neq 7 \).

4. **Edge Case: Large Range:**
   - The program should handle large ranges efficiently.
   - Example: \( k \geq 10000 \), \( k \leq 900000000 \).

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

   - Expected Output: 800000000
   - Program Output: 800000000

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the provided examples and additional edge cases. It efficiently calculates the number of valid \( k \) values by considering all constraints and ensuring no valid \( k \) is missed or incorrectly excluded.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**. The program correctly meets the problem description for all potential cases based on the analysis and testing performed.
