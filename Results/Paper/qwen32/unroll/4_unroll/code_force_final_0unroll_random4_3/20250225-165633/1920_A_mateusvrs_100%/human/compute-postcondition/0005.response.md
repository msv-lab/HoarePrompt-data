Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a list of constraints. Each constraint is described by a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct. The function returns the results of processing each test case based on the given constraints.**
