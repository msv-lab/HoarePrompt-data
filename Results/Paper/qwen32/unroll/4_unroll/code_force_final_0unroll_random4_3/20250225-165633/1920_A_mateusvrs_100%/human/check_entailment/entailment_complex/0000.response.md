### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by iterating over each test case and processing the constraints to determine the valid range for `k` and then counting the number of integers within that range that do not violate any constraints of type 3.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read to determine the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `n` is read to determine the number of constraints for the current test case.
   - `cx` is initialized as an empty set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to (constraints of type 3).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000000 + 7) to find the minimum value that `k` must be less than or equal to (constraints of type 2).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to find the maximum value that `k` must be greater than or equal to (constraints of type 1).

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the value `x` are read.
   - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx` (indicating `k` cannot be `x`).

4. **Checking Validity of Range**:
   - If `bx` (the minimum value `k` must be) is greater than `ax` (the maximum value `k` can be), it is impossible to satisfy all constraints, so `0` is appended to `r`.
   - Otherwise, the program counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` to get the number of valid `k` values.

5. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid integers `k` for each test case based on the given constraints. The logic handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement, including impossible ranges and constraints of type 3.

### Correctness:
**True**
