Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints.
2. Constraints are of three types:
   - Type 1: \( k \geq x \)
   - Type 2: \( k \leq x \)
   - Type 3: \( k \neq x \)
3. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2.
4. No two constraints are the same.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints \( n \).
   - It then reads each constraint, which is a pair of integers (type \( a \) and value \( x \)).

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - It initializes `cx` as a set to store all values \( x \) for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000007) and `bx` to -1. These will store the maximum value for constraints of type 1 and the minimum value for constraints of type 2, respectively.
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 3, it adds \( x \) to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` (the maximum value from type 1 constraints) is greater than `ax` (the minimum value from type 2 constraints). If so, it means there is no integer \( k \) that can satisfy both types of constraints, and it appends 0 to the result list.
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints:
     - It counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and stores this count in `tmp`.
     - It then calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1` and subtracts `tmp` from it to get the number of valid \( k \) values.
     - This result is appended to the result list.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for handling constraints of types 1 and 2 is correct. It correctly identifies the range `[bx, ax]` that \( k \) must fall within.
- The logic for handling constraints of type 3 is also correct. It identifies and excludes values within the range `[bx, ax]` that should not be included.
- The edge cases, such as when `bx` is greater than `ax`, are handled correctly by returning 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
