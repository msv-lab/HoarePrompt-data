Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `s` of `n` integers. It then constructs and prints a string `r` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where each letter is determined by the corresponding integer in `s` and the frequency of letters used so far.**
