You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd and increments the result by one if true. Then, it adds half of each count (rounded down) to the result. The function outputs the calculated value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, which happens when the XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence is zero after Eve optimally removes numbers.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the numbers is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove numbers such that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Check for Bob's Win**:
   - The program checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd (`a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1`). If this condition is met, Bob can win once before any removals.
   - This is because the XOR of an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s can be zero if the counts are balanced in a specific way, but the condition `a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1` is a simple heuristic that works for the problem's constraints.

2. **Counting Bob's Wins**:
   - The program then iterates over each count `x` in the list `a` (which contains the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).
   - For each count `x`, it adds `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt`. This is because pairs of the same number can be removed without affecting the XOR result (since `x XOR x = 0`).
   - This part of the logic is correct because it counts the maximum number of pairs that can be removed, which helps in making the XOR zero.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the initial condition and the pairs of numbers that can be removed. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
