To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic it uses to compute the maximum number of times Bob can win. The key to solving this problem is understanding the XOR operation and how it interacts with the given constraints.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the solution:

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0 (e.g., 1 XOR 1 = 0).
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., 1 XOR 0 = 1).
   - XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.

3. **Eve's Optimal Strategy**:
   - Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, which means she needs to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes zero as often as possible.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - For the XOR of a sequence to be zero, the count of each number contributing to a specific bit must be even.
   - Specifically, the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s modulo 2 should be considered because:
     - 1 in binary is 01.
     - 2 in binary is 10.
     - 3 in binary is 11.
     - 4 in binary is 100, and it doesn't affect the first two bits.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, removing one of each will make them even, leading to a zero XOR.

5. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, Bob can win once initially. This is checked by the condition `if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1`.
   - For each number type, Eve can remove pairs of numbers to ensure that the count remains even, allowing Bob to win for each pair removed. This is achieved by `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)`.

6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly checks for the initial condition where all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs that can be removed for each number type, ensuring that the counts remain even.
   - The sum of these values gives the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem.

**Reasoning**: The program correctly identifies the initial condition where Bob can win and calculates the number of pairs that can be removed for each number type to maximize Bob's wins. This aligns with the problem's requirements and the given example outputs.

**Correctness: True**
