Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Let's analyze the problem again and understand the solution:

1. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of an even number of identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of identical numbers is the number itself.
   - XOR of a sequence of numbers is non-zero if and only if the count of numbers which are odd in their binary representation is odd.

2. **Observations**:
   - Numbers 1 and 3 have an odd number of 1s in their binary representation (1: `001`, 3: `011`).
   - Numbers 2 and 4 have an even number of 1s in their binary representation (2: `010`, 4: `100`).

3. **Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers have an even count of numbers that are 1 or 3 (since they contribute to the XOR being non-zero).
   - If the count of 1s and 3s is already even, Eve can remove any number, and Bob will win.
   - If the count of 1s and 3s is odd, Eve should remove a 1 or 3 to make it even.

4. **Counting Bob's Wins**:
   - Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - This happens when the count of 1s and 3s is even.
   - Eve can always ensure that the count of 1s and 3s becomes even by removing one 1 or 3 if necessary.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the initial count of 1s and 3s.
   - If the count of 1s and 3s is odd, Eve can make it even by removing one 1 or 3.
   - Each time Eve makes the count of 1s and 3s even, Bob wins.
   - The maximum number of times Bob can win is the number of times Eve can make the count of 1s and 3s even.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Count of 1s and 3s
        count_1_3 = a[0] + a[2]
        # Bob wins if count_1_3 is even
        bob_wins = count_1_3 // 2
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by making the count of 1s and 3s even.
