Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` where `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, and `f` and `k` are additional parameters. It also receives a list `a` of `n` integers. The function performs some computation based on these inputs and returns a value for each test case.**
