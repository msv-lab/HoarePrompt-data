To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it accurately implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's examine the key steps and logic in the code.

The problem requires us to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, never removed, or may be either removed or left, based on the sorting and removal process.

Here's the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        k -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
```

### Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `f`, and `k` are read and adjusted to be zero-indexed (`f -= 1` and `k -= 1`).
   - The list of cube values `a` is read.

2. **Determine Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored (`x = a[f]`).

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order (`a.sort(reverse=True)`).

4. **Decision Logic:**
   - If the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list (`a[k]`) is greater than `x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely not removed (`print('NO')`).
   - If the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list (`a[k]`) is less than `x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely removed (`print('YES')`).
   - If the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list (`a[k]`) is equal to `x`, it means the favorite cube may or may not be removed. The decision depends on:
     - If `k` is the last index (`k == n - 1`), the favorite cube is not removed (`print('YES')`).
     - If the value at the `(k + 1)`-th position in the sorted list (`a[k + 1]`) is less than `x`, the favorite cube is not removed (`print('YES')`).
     - Otherwise, the favorite cube may be either removed or left (`print('MAYBE')`).

### Verification:

- The logic correctly handles the cases where the favorite cube is definitely removed or not removed.
- The edge case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value at the `k`-th position is handled correctly, considering the position of the next element in the sorted list.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
