Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `small_element` has been updated to be equal to `left + 1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, and `arr`) remain unchanged with their initial conditions.
