Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and `clique` is an integer representing the clique number. The function returns an array based on the specified `left` and `right` indices and the `clique` number.**
