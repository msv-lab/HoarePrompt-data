Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all possible cases. Specifically, the program generates a matrix where each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, this does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible sum.

To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each cell in the matrix contains the highest possible value. One way to achieve this is to fill the matrix such that each row and each column contains the numbers from 1 to n in a way that maximizes the sum. One optimal way to do this is to fill the matrix in a way that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and each column, which is essentially constructing a Latin square.

The provided program fills each row with the same permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` and then applies the same permutation to each column, which does not guarantee the maximum sum. For example, consider the case where `n = 3`:

The program would generate the following matrix:
```
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
The sum of this matrix is `18`.

However, a better arrangement could be:
```
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
```
The sum of this matrix is `24`, which is the maximum possible sum for `n = 3`.

Therefore, the provided program does not always produce the maximum possible sum for the matrix, making it incorrect.
