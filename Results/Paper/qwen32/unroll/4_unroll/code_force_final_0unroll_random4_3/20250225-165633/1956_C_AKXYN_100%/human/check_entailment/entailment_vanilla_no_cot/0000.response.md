Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum for the matrix and does not produce the correct sequence of operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Sum**:
   - The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. This formula is incorrect for the problem at hand.
   - The maximum sum should be `n * (n * n + n) / 2`, which is the sum of the first `n * n` natural numbers, divided by 2 because each number from 1 to n appears exactly `n` times in the optimal arrangement.

2. **Incorrect Operations**:
   - The operations are supposed to fill the matrix in such a way that each number from 1 to n appears `n` times, which maximizes the sum.
   - The provided program's operations do not achieve this goal. Instead, it fills the matrix in a way that does not guarantee the maximum sum.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output should include the correct maximum sum and the operations performed to achieve this sum.
   - The provided program outputs the operations in reverse order and does not ensure that each number from 1 to n appears `n` times in the matrix.

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the maximum sum, we need to ensure that each number from 1 to n appears `n` times in the matrix. One way to do this is to fill the first row with the numbers 1 to n, the second row with the numbers 2 to n and 1, and so on, wrapping around as necessary. This can be done with `n` Type 1 operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * n + n) // 2
        print(max_sum, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', i, *(j % n + 1 for j in range(i, i + n)))

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides the operations needed to achieve this sum using exactly `n` Type 1 operations.
