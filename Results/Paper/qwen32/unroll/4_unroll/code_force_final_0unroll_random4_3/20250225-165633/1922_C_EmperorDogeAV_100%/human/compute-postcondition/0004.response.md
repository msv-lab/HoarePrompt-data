Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cities` which is a list of lists containing the coordinates of cities in ascending order for each test case, and `n` which is the number of test cases. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum travel cost for each city to its closest neighboring city and returns a list `prog_cities` containing `n-1` elements. Each element in `prog_cities` is either `1` if the next city is closer or the distance to the previous city if the previous city is closer.**
