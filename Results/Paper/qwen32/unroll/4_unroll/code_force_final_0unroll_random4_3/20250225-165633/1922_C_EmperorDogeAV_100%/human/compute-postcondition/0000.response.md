The code initializes a list named `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros. This means that the length of `prog_cities` is one less than the number of test cases `n`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n). Each integer in the sublist satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function receives an additional parameter n, which is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, there are m queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and each query consists of two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city in each test case, the closest city is uniquely determined; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.**
