Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly calculates the closest city and the cost to travel to it.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest city and assigns costs incorrectly. For example, in the example provided, it should assign a cost of 1 when traveling to the closest city, but it assigns the actual distance instead.

2. **Incorrect Indexing and Calculation of Prefix Sums**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) based on the incorrect costs calculated by `func_1`.
   - The prefix sums are used to determine the minimum cost to travel between cities, but since the costs are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the input correctly but does not handle the closest city logic properly, leading to incorrect cost calculations.
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to travel to the closest city for a minimal cost, which is a key part of the problem.

Here is an example of how the program fails:

**Example Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce the expected output because it incorrectly calculates the costs to travel between cities and does not handle the closest city logic correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
