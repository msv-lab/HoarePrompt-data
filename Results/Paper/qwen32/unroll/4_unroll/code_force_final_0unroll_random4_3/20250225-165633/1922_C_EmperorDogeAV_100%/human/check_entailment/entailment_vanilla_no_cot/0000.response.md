Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because of several issues in the logic and implementation of the `func_1` function and the way the prefix sums are being used to compute the minimum number of coins. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost to travel to the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly calculates the cost. Specifically, the function should return a list where each element represents the cost to travel to the closest city from the current city. The current implementation incorrectly assigns `1` when the forward city is closer, but it should instead assign the distance to the closest city.
   - The function also incorrectly calculates the cost for the last city in the list, as it does not handle the case where `i == n-1` correctly. It should handle this case separately, as there is no forward city to compare.

2. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are being used to compute the total cost to travel from one city to another. However, the current implementation does not correctly account for the fact that the cost to travel to the closest city is `1` coin, and the cost to travel directly to a farther city is the distance between the two cities.
   - The prefix sums are being computed incorrectly because they are summing up the costs returned by `func_1`, which are not the actual costs to travel to the closest city.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - When handling each query, the program uses the prefix sums to compute the cost. However, since the prefix sums are not correctly calculated, the results are incorrect.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting city is farther than the destination city by reversing the prefix sums and using them. This logic is flawed because the prefix sums do not correctly represent the costs to travel between cities.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly calculate the cost to travel to the closest city for each city, and then use this information to compute the minimum cost for each query. The prefix sums should be computed based on the actual costs to travel to the closest city, and the program should correctly handle the queries by using these prefix sums.
