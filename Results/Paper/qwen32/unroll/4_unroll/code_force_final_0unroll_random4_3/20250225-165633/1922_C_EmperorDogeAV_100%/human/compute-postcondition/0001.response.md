The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute `n - 1` times, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1).

Given that `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros, it is consistent with the requirement that the loop runs `n - 1` times.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2 and `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n). Each integer in the sublist satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function receives an additional parameter `n`, which is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, there are m queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and each query consists of two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city in each test case, the closest city is uniquely determined; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0**
