### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of traveling between two cities based on the defined rules. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city in the list and then calculates the prefix sums of these distances to efficiently answer the queries.

Let's break down the program and the helper function `func_1`:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Helper Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the list of city coordinates and the number of cities `n` as input.
   - It initializes a list `prog_cities` of size `n-1` to store the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city except the last one.
   - For each city `i` (except the first and the last), it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - It then determines if the next city is closer or the previous city is closer and assigns `1` (if the next city is closer) or the distance to the next city (if the previous city is closer) to `prog_cities[i]`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the distances in `prog_cities` for both the forward and backward directions.
   - The prefix sums are stored in `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, respectively.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b` using the prefix sums.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates `prog_cities`. It should assign `1` if the next city is closer, but it assigns the distance to the next city instead. This is a critical issue because the program relies on the correct identification of the closest city to determine the cost of traveling between cities.
  - Specifically, the line `prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])` should be `prog_cities[i] = 1` if `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the helper function `func_1`, the program does not correctly identify the closest city for each city, leading to incorrect calculations of the minimum travel cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
