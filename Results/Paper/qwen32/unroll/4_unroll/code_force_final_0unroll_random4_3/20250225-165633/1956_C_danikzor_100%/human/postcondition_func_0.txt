The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` matrix. For each test case, it prints a specific sequence of numbers: first, it prints the value of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` followed by `2 * n`. Then, for each `i` from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines: the first line starts with `1 i` followed by numbers from `n` to `1`, and the second line starts with `2 i` followed by the same sequence of numbers from `n` to `1`.
