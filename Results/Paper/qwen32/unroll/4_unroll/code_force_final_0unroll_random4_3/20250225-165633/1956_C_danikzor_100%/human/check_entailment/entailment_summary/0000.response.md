### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of all the numbers in the `n x n` matrix using a specific sequence of operations. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that we are placing the numbers `1` to `n` in each row and each column optimally to maximize the sum. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Since each number from `1` to `n` appears in each row and each column exactly once, the total sum is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2) + n * (n * (n + 1) / 2) - sum of the diagonal elements (which are counted twice)`. Simplifying this gives the formula used in the program.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program performs `2 * n` operations. For each `i` from `1` to `n`, it performs two operations:
     - A Type 1 operation on row `i` with permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1`.
     - A Type 2 operation on column `i` with the same permutation.
   - These operations ensure that every row and every column contains the numbers `1` to `n` in some order, thus maximizing the sum of the matrix.

3. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary aligns with the program's logic. It correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the required number of operations.
   - The operations described in the summary match the program's output format and ensure that each row and column is filled optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve that sum. It adheres to the constraints of the problem, including the limit of `2 * n` operations.

**Correctness: True**
