### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through each test case and attempts to find the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements in the array. The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
2. Iterate through the array, counting the length of consecutive segments of identical elements.
3. Update `minn` with the minimum length of these segments.
4. If `minn` is `inf` (which should not happen since the array is beautiful) or the entire array is a single segment, output `-1` (indicating the array cannot be made not beautiful).
5. Otherwise, output `minn`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Finding Minimum Segment Length**: The program correctly calculates the minimum length of segments of identical elements. However, it does not handle the case where the last segment of identical elements is the shortest correctly because it updates `minn` only when it encounters a different element. This is a valid approach as long as it correctly handles the last segment by updating `minn` after the loop.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case where the entire array consists of the same element by checking if `minn` equals the length of the array.
3. **Final Update for `minn`**: The program correctly updates `minn` with the last segment length after the loop, ensuring that the last segment is considered.

The program's logic for finding the minimum segment length is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases specified in the problem statement. The original assessment incorrectly identifies an issue with the logic for finding the minimum segment length, when in fact, the program correctly implements this logic.

#### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is correct. It correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful by finding the minimum length of segments of identical elements and handling the edge cases properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
