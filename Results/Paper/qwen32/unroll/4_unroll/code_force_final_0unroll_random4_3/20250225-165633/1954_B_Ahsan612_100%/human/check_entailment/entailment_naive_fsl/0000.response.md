Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly account for all scenarios where the array can stop being beautiful after removing elements. Let's analyze the code and identify the potential issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Elements:**
   - The code uses a variable `same` to count consecutive elements that are the same. It resets `same` whenever it encounters a different element.
   - However, the logic to find the minimum group of consecutive elements (`minn`) is flawed. It only considers the length of the first group and does not correctly handle cases where the minimum group is not at the start of the array.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple groups of different lengths. For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]`. The code might incorrectly determine that the minimum group is of length 2, but removing one element from either group of 2s does not make the array stop being beautiful.

3. **Incorrect Condition for `-1`:**
   - The condition to print `-1` is based on `minn` being `inf` or equal to the length of the array. This is not sufficient. For example, an array like `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]` should return `2` (remove one element from each group of `2`s), but the code might return `-1`.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1 1 2 2 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output of the Provided Code:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- The array `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]` is beautiful.
- To make it stop being beautiful, we can remove one element from each group of `2`s, resulting in `[1, 1, 1, 1]` or `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, both of which are not beautiful.
- The provided code incorrectly returns `-1` because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle all edge cases correctly and fails to provide the correct output for some test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
