### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The approach taken in the code is to identify the smallest segment of consecutive elements that are the same and remove all but one element from that segment. If the entire array is a single segment (i.e., all elements are the same), or if no such segment can be identified, the function returns `-1`.

Let's break down the logic step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to `1` to count the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is set to infinity to track the minimum length of segments found.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, the length of the previous segment (`same`) is compared with `minn`, and `minn` is updated if `same` is smaller. Then, `num` is updated to the current element, and `same` is reset to `1`.

3. **Final comparison**:
   - After the loop, the length of the last segment is compared with `minn`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array, it means the array is either empty or all elements are the same, and the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `minn`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the smallest segment to make the array stop being beautiful.

### Correctness:

The program correctly identifies the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements and calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from that segment to make the array stop being beautiful. If the entire array is a single segment or no such segment exists, it correctly returns `-1`.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem's requirements and handles all edge cases as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
