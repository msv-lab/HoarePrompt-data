In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Since the loop head does not directly involve `n`, `a`, or any other variables defined within the loop body, we only need to ensure that `t` is set appropriately to allow the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop executes `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute if `t` (obtained from `int(input())`) is greater than 0.
3. The current state is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0.

Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within the valid range for the loop to execute, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. The variables `n` and `a` are defined inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further to ensure the loop executes. The state remains as provided.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
