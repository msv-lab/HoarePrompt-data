Let's carefully analyze the provided program code and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a`.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, we need to consider two scenarios:
    1. **Scenario 1 (Regular Purchase)**: Buying each yogurt at the regular price `a`, resulting in a total cost of `a * n`.
    2. **Scenario 2 (Promotion Purchase)**: Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price `b`, and then buying any remaining yogurt at the regular price `a`. The total cost in this scenario is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
  - The minimum cost is the smaller value between `ans1` (regular purchase) and `ans2` (promotion purchase).

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates:
  - `ans1` as `a * n` (total cost if buying all yogurts at regular price).
  - `ans2` as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` (total cost if buying pairs of yogurts at promotional price and any remaining yogurt at regular price).
- It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n` is 1, it directly prints `a` as the cost.

### Function Summary:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints the minimum cost for each test case, where the cost is determined based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the correctness of the program by checking the logic and implementation against the problem description and the provided examples.

- **Example 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Regular purchase: `5 * 2 = 10`
  - Promotion purchase: `9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - Minimum cost: `9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Example 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Regular purchase: `5 * 3 = 15`
  - Promotion purchase: `9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
  - Minimum cost: `14`
  - Output: `14` (Correct)

- **Example 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Regular purchase: `5 * 3 = 15`
  - Promotion purchase: `11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
  - Minimum cost: `15`
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Example 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Regular purchase: `5 * 4 = 20`
  - Promotion purchase: `11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `20`
  - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given logic and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
