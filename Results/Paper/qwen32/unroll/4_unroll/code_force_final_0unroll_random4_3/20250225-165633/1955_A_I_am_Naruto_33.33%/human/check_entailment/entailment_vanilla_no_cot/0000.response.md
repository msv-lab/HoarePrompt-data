Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the minimum cost when buying `n` yogurts. Specifically, the line `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of buying two yogurts at a discount and then buying the remaining yogurt(s) at the regular price.

Here's the correct approach:
1. Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the discounted price.
2. Calculate the cost for these pairs.
3. Calculate the cost for any remaining yogurt that cannot be bought in a pair.
4. Sum these costs to get the minimum total cost.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        ans = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(ans)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum cost for any number of yogurts `n` by considering the optimal number of pairs to buy at the discounted price and the cost of any remaining yogurt.
