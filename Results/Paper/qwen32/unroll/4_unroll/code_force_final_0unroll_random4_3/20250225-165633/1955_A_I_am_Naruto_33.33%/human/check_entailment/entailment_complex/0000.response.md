Reasoning:  
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b`. Here's how it works:

1. For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It then calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price `a`, i.e., `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is the cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought in pairs at the promotion price `b`. The number of pairs is `n // 2`, and the cost for these pairs is `b * (n // 2)`. If there is an odd number of yogurts, one more yogurt is bought at the regular price `a`, i.e., `a * (n % 2)`.
3. The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The logic correctly handles the case when `n` is 1 by directly printing `a` since there's no benefit from the promotion in this case.

The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results based on this logic:
- For `n=2`, `a=5`, `b=9`, the minimum cost is `9` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price).
- For `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=9`, the minimum cost is `14` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price).
- For `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=11`, the minimum cost is `15` (buying all three yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price and one at the regular price).
- For `n=4`, `a=5`, `b=11`, the minimum cost is `20` (buying two pairs at the promotion price).

Thus, the program is correct for the given problem statement and examples.
