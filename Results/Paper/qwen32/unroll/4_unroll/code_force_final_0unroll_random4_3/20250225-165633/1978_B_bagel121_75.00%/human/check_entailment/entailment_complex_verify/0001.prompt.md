You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown

Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins for the first bun, down to `(b - k + 1)` coins for the `k`-th bun. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to find the optimal `k` to maximize the total profit.

### Key Points

1. **When `a >= b`:** If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the starting price `b`, it's always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because the promotional price will never be higher than the usual price.

2. **When `a < b`:** We need to determine the optimal number `k` of buns to sell at the promoted price. The promotional price decreases linearly from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`. The sum of this arithmetic series is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: `S = (first_term + last_term) * number_of_terms / 2`. Here, `first_term = b`, `last_term = (b - k + 1)`, and `number_of_terms = k`. The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is simply `(n - k) * a`.

3. **Optimal `k`:** The optimal `k` is the maximum possible value that doesn't exceed `n` or the point where the promotional price becomes less than or equal to the usual price `a`. Thus, `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `a >= b`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`.
4. If `a < b`, it calculates the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
5. It calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.
6. It calculates the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns as `(n - k) * a`.
7. It prints the total profit.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit based on the given conditions. It handles both scenarios (`a >= b` and `a < b`) appropriately and calculates the profit accurately.
