Let's go through the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
Bob sells `n` buns. He can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a special price that decreases by 1 coin for each subsequent bun sold (starting from `b` coins for the first bun), and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual `a` coins each. The goal is to maximize the profit from selling all `n` buns.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `a` (usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (initial special price), it means selling all buns at the usual price will yield the maximum profit since the special price would not be beneficial (it would decrease further).
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the program calculates the optimal `k`:
     - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the special price does not drop below the usual price `a`.
     - The total profit from selling the first `k` buns at the special price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
     - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the total profit.
   - The sum of these two parts gives the total profit for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `a >= b`, the program correctly returns `n * a`.
   - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit by considering the optimal `k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions. It handles the edge cases appropriately and uses the correct formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the profit from the first `k` buns.

**Correctness: True**
