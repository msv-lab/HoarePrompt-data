### Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling buns under the promotion rules. The key is to determine the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the discounted price.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the provided code:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the number of buns \( n \), the usual price \( a \), and the price of the first bun \( b \) are read.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the price of the first bun \( b \), it is more profitable to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). Therefore, the profit is \( n \times a \).
   - If \( a < b \), Bob should sell some buns at the discounted price to maximize profit. The number of buns \( k \) to sell at the discounted price is determined as the minimum of \( b - a + 1 \) and \( n \). This is because the price drops by 1 for each subsequent bun, and the price should not drop below the usual price \( a \).
     - The formula for the sum of the prices of the first \( k \) buns sold at the discounted price is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula: \(\text{sum} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price is \( (n - k) \times a \).
     - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the calculated maximum profit is printed.

### Correctness:
The logic correctly handles the conditions and calculates the maximum profit for each test case. The use of the arithmetic series sum formula ensures that the profit from the discounted buns is calculated accurately. The decision to sell all buns at the usual price when \( a \geq b \) is also correct.

Thus, the provided program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
