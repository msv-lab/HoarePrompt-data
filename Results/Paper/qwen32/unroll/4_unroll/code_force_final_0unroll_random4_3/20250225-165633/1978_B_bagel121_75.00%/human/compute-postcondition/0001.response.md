In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, the only variable we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The initial state provided does not specify the value of `t`, so we need to ensure that it is set to a value that allows the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1**
