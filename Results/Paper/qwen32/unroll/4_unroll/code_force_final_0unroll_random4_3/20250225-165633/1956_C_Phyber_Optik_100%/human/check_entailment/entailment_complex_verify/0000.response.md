### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix and adheres to the constraints.

#### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The maximum possible sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix such that each number \( i \) appears \( i \) times in the matrix. Specifically, the sum of the first \( n \) squares is the maximum sum:
\[ \text{Sum} = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2 \]

For \( n = 2 \), the maximum sum is:
\[ 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \]

However, the problem statement mentions that the sum should be 7 for \( n = 2 \), which is achieved by filling the matrix as:
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]
This results in a sum of 6, not 7. Let's clarify the correct sum for \( n = 2 \):
\[ 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 \]
This can be achieved with the operations:
\[ 1 1 1 2 \]
\[ 1 2 2 1 \]

#### Program Analysis
The provided program calculates the sum correctly using the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \]

However, the operations it generates do not correctly maximize the sum. The program outputs:
\[ 1 \, n - j + 1 \, 1 \, 2 \, \ldots \, n \]
\[ 2 \, n - j + 1 \, 1 \, 2 \, \ldots \, n \]

For \( n = 2 \), the operations are:
\[ 1 2 1 2 \]
\[ 2 2 1 2 \]
\[ 1 1 1 2 \]
\[ 2 1 1 2 \]

This results in the matrix:
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \]
which sums to 6, not 7.

#### Correct Operations
To achieve the maximum sum of 7 for \( n = 2 \), the correct operations should be:
\[ 1 1 1 2 \]
\[ 1 2 2 1 \]

This fills the matrix as:
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]
which sums to 7.

#### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The program calculates the sum correctly but does not generate the correct operations to achieve the maximum sum for the matrix.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
