To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using type 1 and type 2 operations. Type 1 allows us to set the `i-th` row to any permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and type 2 allows us to set the `i-th` column to any permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum with no more than `2n` operations.

### Optimal Solution

The optimal strategy is to fill each row with the numbers 1 through `n` in ascending order. This ensures that each row contributes the maximum possible sum, which is `1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n + 1) / 2`. Since there are `n` rows, the total sum will be `n * n(n + 1) / 2 = n^2(n + 1) / 2`.

### Implementation Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum using a loop that iterates from 2 to `n`. The formula used in the loop seems to be an attempt to calculate the sum of the series, but it is not the correct formula for the maximum sum. The correct formula is `n^2(n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Operations:**
   - The program outputs `n + n` operations, which is `2n` as required.
   - For each row `j` from 1 to `n`, it performs two operations:
     - Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation in the loop is incorrect. The correct sum should be `n^2(n + 1) / 2`.

2. **Operations:**
   - The operations performed by the program do not guarantee the maximum sum. The operations are filling rows and columns with the same permutation, which is not the optimal strategy to maximize the sum.

### Correct Implementation

The correct implementation should:
- Calculate the sum using the formula `n^2(n + 1) / 2`.
- Perform operations to fill each row with the numbers 1 through `n`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(max_sum, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximum sum correctly and does not perform the operations in a way that maximizes the sum. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
