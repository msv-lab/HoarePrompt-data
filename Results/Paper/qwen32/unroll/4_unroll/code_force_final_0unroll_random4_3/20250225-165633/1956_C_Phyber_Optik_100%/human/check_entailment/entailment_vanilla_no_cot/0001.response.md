Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
     - Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
   - The maximum sum is always achievable within 2n operations.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates the maximum sum `sum` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i
     \]
     Simplifying the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i-1) \times i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
     This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
     Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}, \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     Therefore:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right)
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 2
     \]
     This is the correct formula for the maximum sum.

   - The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2n`.
   - For each operation, it prints:
     - Type 1 operation on row `n-j+1` with permutation `1 2 3 ... n`.
     - Type 2 operation on column `n-j+1` with permutation `1 2 3 ... n`.

3. **Verification of Operations**:
   - The operations described will indeed fill the matrix in such a way that the sum of the matrix is maximized.
   - The operations ensure that each row and each column contains a permutation from 1 to n, which maximizes the sum.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum within the allowed number of operations (2n).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
