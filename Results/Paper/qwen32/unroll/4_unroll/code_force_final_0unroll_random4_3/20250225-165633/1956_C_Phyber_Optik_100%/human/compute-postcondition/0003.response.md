Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n × n matrix. For each test case, the function processes an n × n matrix and returns a specific output based on the matrix data. However, the exact processing and return value of the matrix are not specified in the provided constraints and relationships.**
