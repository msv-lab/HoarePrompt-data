### Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Assign a permutation \( p \) to a row.
2. Assign a permutation \( p \) to a column.

The provided program calculates the maximum possible sum \( s \) of the matrix and outputs the operations needed to achieve this sum.

#### Calculation of the Sum:
- The program calculates the sum of the matrix as follows:
  \[
  \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2
  \]
  This formula ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized because each position in the matrix will hold the highest possible value it can take under permutation constraints.

#### Operations:
- The program suggests performing \( 2n \) operations:
  - For each row from \( n \) to 1, it assigns the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to the row.
  - For each column from \( n \) to 1, it assigns the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to the column.
  
  This approach ensures that all cells of the matrix are filled with the highest possible values allowed by permutations.

#### Correctness of the Sum Calculation:
- The sum calculated is indeed the maximum possible sum for the given matrix size \( n \). This is because each cell in the matrix will be filled with the highest possible value it can take under permutation constraints, and the sum of the first \( n \) squares is the correct formula for this scenario.

#### Correctness of the Operations:
- The operations suggested by the program ensure that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values. By assigning the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to each row and then to each column, the program ensures that the matrix is filled optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
