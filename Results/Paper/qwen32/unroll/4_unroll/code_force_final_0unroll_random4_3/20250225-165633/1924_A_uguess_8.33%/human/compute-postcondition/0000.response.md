Output State: **`t` is an input integer, for each test case, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer. The conditions and constraints for the other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) remain the same as specified in the initial state.
