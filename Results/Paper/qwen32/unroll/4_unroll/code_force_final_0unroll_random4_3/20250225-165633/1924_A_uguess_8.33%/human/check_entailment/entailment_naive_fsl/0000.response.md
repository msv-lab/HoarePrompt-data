Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly check whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The logic in the program is flawed and does not address the problem requirements accurately.

Here are some specific issues with the program:

1. **Counting Subsequences**: The program attempts to count the number of times all `k` characters have appeared in the string `s` using a bitmask approach. However, this does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked. The program only checks if all `k` characters have appeared together, not in any sequence of length `n`.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The program generates a missing subsequence incorrectly. It tries to construct a subsequence that is not present in `s` based on the bitmask, but this approach does not guarantee that the generated subsequence is indeed missing from `s`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is greater than `k`, it should directly print "NO" and any string of length `n` using the first `k` characters, as it is impossible to form all possible subsequences of length `n` using fewer than `n` unique characters.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. One possible approach is to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`. This can be computationally expensive, but it ensures correctness.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in sub)

def generate_all_strings(n, k):
    if n == 0:
        return [""]
    smaller_strings = generate_all_strings(n - 1, k)
    return [chr(ord('a') + i) + s for i in range(k) for s in smaller_strings]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        all_strings = generate_all_strings(n, k)
        missing_subsequence = None
        for sub in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, sub):
                missing_subsequence = sub
                break
        if missing_subsequence is None:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            print(missing_subsequence)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# func()
```

This corrected version generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters and checks if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If a missing subsequence is found, it prints "NO" and the missing subsequence; otherwise, it prints "YES".
