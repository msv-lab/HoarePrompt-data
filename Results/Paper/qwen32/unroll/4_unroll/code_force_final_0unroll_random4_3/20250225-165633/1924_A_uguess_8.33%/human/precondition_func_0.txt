t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, for each test case, n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
