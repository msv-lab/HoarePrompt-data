The given code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This input typically includes the integers `n` and `q` for a test case, followed by the array `a` of `n` integers, and then `q` pairs of integers representing the queries.

Given the initial state, the input is split into a list called `data`. Therefore, `data` will contain all the integers as strings in the order they were read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values.**
