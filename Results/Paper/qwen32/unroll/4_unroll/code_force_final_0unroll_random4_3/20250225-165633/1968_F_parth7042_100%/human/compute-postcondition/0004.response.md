The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `index` is 2; `results` is an empty list.**
