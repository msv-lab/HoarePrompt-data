Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `q`, where `n` is the length of an array `a` containing `n` integers, and `q` is the number of queries. Each integer in the array `a` is between 0 and \(2^{30} - 1\). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each query, which is not specified in detail here. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\) and the total sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).**
