Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is 0, which means there are no iterations.
  - `data` is a list of strings representing the input values.
  - `index` is incremented by `2 + 2n + 2q` for each of the `t` iterations. Since `t` is 0, `index` remains unchanged.
  - `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings based on the queries. Since there are no iterations (`t` is 0), `results` is an empty list.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('\n'.join(results))
  ```

Since `results` is an empty list, the `'\n'.join(results)` operation will produce an empty string. Therefore, the `print` statement will print an empty line.

**Output: ** (an empty line)

To clearly format the output as requested:
Output: **(an empty line)**
