Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the integer value from `data[index]`, and since `index` was initially 0, it is incremented to 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
