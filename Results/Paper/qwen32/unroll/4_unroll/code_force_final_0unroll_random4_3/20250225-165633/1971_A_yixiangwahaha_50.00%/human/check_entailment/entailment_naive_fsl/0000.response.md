Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the number of test cases correctly. The problem description specifies that the number of test cases `t` can be between 1 and 100, but the program hardcoded to handle exactly 10 test cases. This means that if the input has fewer or more than 10 test cases, the program will not work as expected.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```
The program will attempt to read 10 test cases and will fail because there are only 3 test cases provided. Similarly, if the input has more than 10 test cases, the program will only process the first 10 and ignore the rest.

To fix this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` and then use a loop that runs `t` times instead of a fixed 10 times. Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```
