The provided code snippet is `a = int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. However, the initial state describes a more complex input scenario involving multiple test cases with binary strings, which is not directly relevant to this single line of code. Given the code snippet alone, it reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, the function takes no arguments but operates on input provided as described. The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively, followed by the binary strings a and b themselves. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
