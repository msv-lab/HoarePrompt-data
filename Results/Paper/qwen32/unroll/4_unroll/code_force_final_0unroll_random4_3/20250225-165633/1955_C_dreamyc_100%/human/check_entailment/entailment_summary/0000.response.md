Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the cumulative sums from both ends of the list `nums` and comparing them to `a` (half of `k` rounded up) and `b` (half of `k` rounded down). However, the logic in the program is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer attacked. The approach of adding up the cumulative sums and comparing them to `a` and `b` does not accurately simulate the process of attacking the ships in the alternating first and last manner described in the problem.

The correct approach should simulate the attacks on the first and last ships until either all ships have been sunk or the number of attacks `k` has been exhausted. This involves decrementing the durability of the first and last ships and removing them from the list of ships when their durability reaches zero.

The provided program's logic does not correctly simulate this process, and therefore, it does not provide the correct number of ships sunk.

Correctness: **False**
