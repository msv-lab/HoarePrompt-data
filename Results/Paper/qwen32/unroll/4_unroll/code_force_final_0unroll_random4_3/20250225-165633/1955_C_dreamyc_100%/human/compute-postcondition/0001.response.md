Output State: **The program returns the integer `n` which represents the number of integers in the list `nums` for each test case.**

Explanation: Since the code snippet only returns `n`, and `n` is defined as the number of integers in the list `nums` for each test case, the output state directly reflects that the function returns `n`.
