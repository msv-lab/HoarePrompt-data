#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

    #The program returns `ans`, which is the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `k`, an integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers. It returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integers in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns `ans`, which is the total number of times the cumulative sums from the start (`s_a`) and from the end (`s_b`) of the list `nums` are less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and `b` (which is `k // 2`), respectively.
