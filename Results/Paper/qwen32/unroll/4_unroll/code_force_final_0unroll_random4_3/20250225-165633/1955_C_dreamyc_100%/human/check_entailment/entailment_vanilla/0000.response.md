To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a series of attacks by the Kraken on a line of ships. The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship, then the first again, and so on, until either all ships have sunk or the Kraken has completed `k` attacks. Each attack reduces the durability of the target ship by 1. The task is to determine how many ships have sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a function `func_1` to determine the number of ships sunk. Let's break down the function:

1. **Initial Check**: 
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ships' durabilities (`sum(nums)`), then all ships will sink because the total number of attacks is more than the total durability of all ships combined.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem's logic.

2. **Attack Distribution**:
   - The program calculates `a` as the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` as `k // 2`. This is intended to distribute the attacks between the first and the last ship.
   - `a` and `b` represent the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively.

3. **Counting Sunk Ships**:
   - The program then iterates over the ships from both ends, maintaining cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` for the first and last ships.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `s_a` (cumulative durability of the first ships) is less than or equal to `a` and if `s_b` (cumulative durability of the last ships) is less than or equal to `b`.
   - If either condition is met, it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`).

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for counting the number of sunk ships is incorrect. The program does not properly account for the alternating attack pattern and the fact that ships are removed from the sequence once they sink.
- The program does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern or the removal of sunk ships from the sequence.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the alternating attack pattern and remove ships from the sequence once they sink. A more accurate approach would involve using a deque to efficiently remove ships from both ends and keeping track of the number of attacks.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program's logic, it is not correct for solving the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
