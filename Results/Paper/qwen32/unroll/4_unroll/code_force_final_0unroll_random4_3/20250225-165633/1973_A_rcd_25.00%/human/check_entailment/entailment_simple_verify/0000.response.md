### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotations and the given problem description to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players after a series of chess games.
- **Constraints**:
  - Each game results in 2 points for the winner, 1 point for each player in a draw, or 0 points for the loser.
  - The scores are provided in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
  - The total points must be even because each game distributes 2 points.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Total Points Validation**:
   - The program checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even. If not, it prints `-1` because points from games must be in multiples of 2.
   - This is correct because the sum of points from all games must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
     - **Reasoning**: If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2`. This is because `p1` and `p2` could have drawn among themselves, and the rest of the points could have come from games involving `p3`.
   - **Case 2**: Otherwise, it calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other scores.
     - **Reasoning**: This step aims to find a valid number of draws that satisfies the conditions.
     - The program iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws.
     - **Condition Check**: It checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If true, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
     - **Else**: It increments `cur` and continues until a valid draw count is found or `high` is reached. If no valid draw count is found, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (`0 0 0`) by printing `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are inconsistent by printing `-1`.

#### Annotations and Testing:

- **Annotations**:
  - The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, ensuring that the logic is correctly implemented.
  - The annotations show the values of `low`, `high`, and `cur` during the iteration, which helps in understanding the logic.

- **Testing**:
  - The provided examples and additional edge cases were tested, and the program produced the expected outputs.
  - **Example 1**: `0 0 0` -> **Expected Output**: `0` -> **Actual Output**: `0` -> **Correct**.
  - **Example 2**: `0 1 1` -> **Expected Output**: `1` -> **Actual Output**: `1` -> **Correct**.
  - **Example 3**: `1 1 1` -> **Expected Output**: `-1` -> **Actual Output**: `-1` -> **Correct**.
  - **Example 4**: `1 1 2` -> **Expected Output**: `2` -> **Actual Output**: `2` -> **Correct**.
  - **Example 5**: `3 3 3` -> **Expected Output**: `-1` -> **Actual Output**: `-1` -> **Correct**.
  - **Example 6**: `3 4 5` -> **Expected Output**: `6` -> **Actual Output**: `6` -> **Correct**.
  - **Example 7**: `1 1 10` -> **Expected Output**: `2` -> **Actual Output**: `2` -> **Correct**.

#### Conclusion:
After thorough analysis and testing, the program correctly handles all scenarios and edge cases described in the problem statement. The logic for validating scores and calculating the maximum number of draws is robust and consistent with the problem requirements.
