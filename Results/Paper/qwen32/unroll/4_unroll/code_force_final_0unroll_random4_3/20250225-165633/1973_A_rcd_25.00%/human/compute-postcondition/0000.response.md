The provided code snippet only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are each integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and there are `t` such test cases.**
