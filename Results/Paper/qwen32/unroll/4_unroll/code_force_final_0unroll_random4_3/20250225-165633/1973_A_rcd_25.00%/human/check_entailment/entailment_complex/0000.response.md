Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players.
- The scores are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` where `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- The sum of all scores must be even because each game gives a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw).
- If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because `p3` could have defeated `p1` and `p2` in all their games and the rest could have been draws.
- Otherwise, we need to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the scores under certain conditions.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have a valid set of games with an odd total score.
   
2. **Case `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws as `p1 + p2`. This is because `p3` could have defeated `p1` and `p2` in all their games, and the rest could have been draws.
   
3. **Case `p3 < p1 + p2`**:
   - The program calculates `low` and `high` as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)` and `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)` respectively.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining scores can be distributed in a valid way.
   - If a valid number of draws is found, it prints the number of draws. If no valid number is found in the loop, it prints `p3`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input: `0 0 0`**:
   - Sum is 0 (even), `p3 < p1 + p2` (0 < 0 is false), so it prints `0` (correct).

2. **Input: `0 1 1`**:
   - Sum is 2 (even), `p3 < p1 + p2` (1 < 1 is false), so it prints `1` (correct).

3. **Input: `1 1 1`**:
   - Sum is 3 (odd), so it prints `-1` (correct).

4. **Input: `1 1 2`**:
   - Sum is 4 (even), `p3 < p1 + p2` (2 < 2 is false), so it prints `2` (correct).

5. **Input: `3 3 3`**:
   - Sum is 9 (odd), so it prints `-1` (correct).

6. **Input: `3 4 5`**:
   - Sum is 12 (even), `p3 < p1 + p2` (5 < 7 is true), so it calculates the maximum number of draws and prints `6` (correct).

7. **Input: `1 1 10`**:
   - Sum is 12 (even), `p3 < p1 + p2` (10 < 2 is false), so it prints `2` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program handles all the edge cases and correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or determines if the scores are inconsistent. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
