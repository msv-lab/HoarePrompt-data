You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integer scores of players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved by adjusting the scores under certain conditions and prints that value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Three friends play chess.
- Each game results in either 2 points to the winner, 1 point to each in a draw, or 0 points to the loser.
- After all games, their scores are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` with `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Score Validation**:
   - The program checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even. If not, it prints `-1` because points from games must be in multiples of 2 (either 0, 1, or 2 points per game).
   - If the total points are even, it proceeds to determine the maximum number of draws.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is because if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2` (considering that `p1` and `p2` could have drawn among themselves).
   - Otherwise, it calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws that satisfies the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (`0 0 0`) by printing `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are inconsistent by printing `-1`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases to ensure it works correctly.

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input**: `0 0 0` -> **Expected Output**: `0` -> **Actual Output**: `0` -> **Correct**.
2. **Input**: `0 1 1` -> **Expected Output**: `1` -> **Actual Output**: `1` -> **Correct**.
3. **Input**: `1 1 1` -> **Expected Output**: `-1` -> **Actual Output**: `-1` -> **Correct**.
4. **Input**: `1 1 2` -> **Expected Output**: `2` -> **Actual Output**: `2` -> **Correct**.
5. **Input**: `3 3 3` -> **Expected Output**: `-1` -> **Actual Output**: `-1` -> **Correct**.
6. **Input**: `3 4 5` -> **Expected Output**: `6` -> **Actual Output**: `6` -> **Correct**.
7. **Input**: `1 1 10` -> **Expected Output**: `2` -> **Actual Output**: `2` -> **Correct**.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input**: `1 2 3` -> **Expected Output**: `-1` -> **Actual Output**: `-1` -> **Correct**.
2. **Input**: `2 2 2` -> **Expected Output**: `3` -> **Actual Output**: `3` -> **Correct**.
3. **Input**: `0 0 2` -> **Expected Output**: `0` -> **Actual Output**: `0` -> **Correct**.
4. **Input**: `1 2 4` -> **Expected Output**: `-1` -> **Actual Output**: `-1` -> **Correct**.
5. **Input**: `0 2 2` -> **Expected Output**: `1` -> **Actual Output**: `1` -> **Correct**.

### Conclusion:
After testing the program with the provided examples and additional edge cases, it appears to handle all scenarios correctly. The logic for validating scores and calculating the maximum number of draws seems robust.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and scenarios described in the problem statement. It validates the total points to ensure they are even, and then calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. It also correctly identifies and handles inconsistent score scenarios by printing `-1`.
