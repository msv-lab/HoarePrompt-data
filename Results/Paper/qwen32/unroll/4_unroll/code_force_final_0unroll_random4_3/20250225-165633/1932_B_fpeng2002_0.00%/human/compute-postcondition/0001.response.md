To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `num_tests > 0` is satisfied. The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `num_tests`. Given that `num_tests` is the integer value provided by the user input, we need to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
