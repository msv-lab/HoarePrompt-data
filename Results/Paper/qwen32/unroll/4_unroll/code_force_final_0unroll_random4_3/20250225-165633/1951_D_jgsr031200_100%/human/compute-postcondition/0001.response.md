The given initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not involve these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet.
2. The code snippet contains only a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
