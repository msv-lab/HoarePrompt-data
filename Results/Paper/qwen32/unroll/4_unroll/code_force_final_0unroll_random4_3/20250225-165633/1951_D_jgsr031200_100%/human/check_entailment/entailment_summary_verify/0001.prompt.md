You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1 if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it performs a series of calculations and prints 'YES' followed by 2 and two integers `[n - k + 1, 1]` if a certain condition is met; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

The task is to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices per jewel so that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. The key points are:

1. Alice buys greedily from stall 1 to stall 60.
2. The number of stalls should be at most 60.
3. The prices per jewel can be any integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

The provided program has several issues:

1. The function `func_1` is called but is not defined in the given code snippet. This would result in a NameError.
2. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It tries to calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy with the given prices but does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.
3. The program does not consider the possibility of setting different prices for each stall to achieve exactly `k` jewels bought.
4. The program does not handle the case where the number of stalls is more than 2, which is necessary to achieve exactly `k` jewels for arbitrary `n` and `k`.

A correct approach would be to use a strategy to set prices that ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One such strategy is to use powers of 2 to fill the stalls, which is feasible since the prices can be any large integers.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        continue
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    # Use powers of 2 to fill the stalls
    stalls = []
    remaining = k
    power = 0
    
    while remaining > 0:
        if remaining & 1:  # If the bit is set
            price = 2 ** power
            stalls.append(price)
            remaining -= 1
        power += 1
    
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
```

This program correctly handles the problem by ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most 60 stalls. It uses powers of 2 to distribute the stalls such that each stall contributes exactly one jewel to the total count of `k` jewels.

Given the issues in the provided program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
