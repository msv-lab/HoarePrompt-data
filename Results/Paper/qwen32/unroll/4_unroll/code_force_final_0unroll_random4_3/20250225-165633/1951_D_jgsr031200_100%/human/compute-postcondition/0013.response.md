Let's analyze the loop to determine the output state.

The loop iterates over the `costs` list, which contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. During each iteration, it performs the following operations:
1. `curr = n // i`: This calculates the integer division of `n` by the current element `i` in the `costs` list.
2. `h += curr`: This adds the result of the integer division to `h`.
3. `n -= i * curr`: This subtracts the product of `i` and `curr` from `n`.

Let's break down the loop step-by-step using the given `costs` list:

**First Iteration (i = n - k + 1):**
- `curr = n // (n - k + 1)`: Since `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n - k + 1` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`. The integer division `n // (n - k + 1)` will yield `1` if `n` is exactly `n - k + 1` or more, and `0` if `n` is less than `n - k + 1`. However, since `n` is not equal to `k` and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` is always greater than `n - k + 1` when `n > k`, and `n` is equal to `n - k + 1` when `n = k + 1`. Therefore, `curr` will be `1` in most cases.
- `h += curr`: This adds `1` to `h` (or `0` if `curr` is `0`).
- `n -= (n - k + 1) * curr`: This subtracts `n - k + 1` from `n` (or `0` if `curr` is `0`).

After the first iteration, `n` will be reduced to `k` if `n` was initially greater than `k`. If `n` was initially equal to `k + 1`, `n` will be reduced to `k`.

**Second Iteration (i = 1):**
- `curr = n // 1`: Since `n` is now `k` (from the previous iteration), `n // 1` will be `k`.
- `h += curr`: This adds `k` to `h`.
- `n -= 1 * curr`: This subtracts `k` from `n`, making `n` equal to `0`.

After the second iteration, `n` will be `0` and `h` will be `k + 1` (since we added `1` from the first iteration and `k` from the second iteration).

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **n is 0, k remains unchanged, costs remains [n - k + 1, 1], h is k + 1.**
