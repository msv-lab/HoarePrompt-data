Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels for all possible inputs of `n` and `k`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling of n == k**: The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correct.

2. **Handling of n < k**: The program correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO" since it's impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **General Case (n > k)**:
   - The program sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.
   - The logic for setting up the stalls and calculating the number of jewels bought is flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
10 5
```
The program will set up two stalls with prices `10 - 5 + 1 = 6` and `1`. Then it will calculate how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall:
- From the first stall (price 6), Alice can buy `10 // 6 = 1` jewel.
- From the second stall (price 1), Alice can buy `4 // 1 = 4` jewels (since she has `10 - 6 = 4` coins left).
- Total jewels bought: `1 + 4 = 5`.

This specific case works, but the program does not guarantee that it will work for all possible values of `n` and `k`. The program needs a more robust strategy to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up at most 60 stalls with appropriate prices.

A correct approach would involve dynamically determining the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, which is not achieved by the current logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
