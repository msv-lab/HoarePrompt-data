### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Summary:
Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices per jewel such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next, buying as many jewels as possible from each stall until she reaches the total of `k` jewels.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is called but not defined in the given code snippet. This would result in a `NameError` if the function were not defined elsewhere in the code. However, based on the annotations, we can infer the intended logic.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program initializes `costs` as `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with these prices. This logic does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not consider different pricing strategies that could ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not handle cases where the number of stalls exceeds 2, which may be necessary to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations indicate that the program calculates `costs` as `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with these prices.
   - The annotations also show that the program checks if the number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k` and prints 'NO' if it is, otherwise it prints 'YES' and the prices.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve setting prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One effective strategy is to use powers of 2 to fill the stalls. This ensures that each stall can contribute exactly one jewel to the total count of `k` jewels, and since `k` can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, this approach is feasible.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program using the powers of 2 strategy:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        continue
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    # Use powers of 2 to fill the stalls
    stalls = []
    remaining = k
    power = 0
    
    while remaining > 0:
        if remaining & 1:  # If the bit is set
            price = 2 ** power
            stalls.append(price)
            remaining -= 1
        power += 1
    
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
```

#### Evaluation:
Given the issues in the provided program and the annotations, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and does not handle the necessary pricing strategy.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
