The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, which are positive integers with constraints (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}), and the condition that `n` is currently less than `k`. However, these details do not affect the execution of the `print` statement since it is hardcoded to print `'NO'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`.

Output: **NO**
