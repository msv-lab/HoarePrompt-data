The code initializes a list named `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `costs` along with the unchanged values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**
