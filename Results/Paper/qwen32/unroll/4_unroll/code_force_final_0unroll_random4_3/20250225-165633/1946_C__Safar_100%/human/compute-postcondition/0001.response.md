The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(a, b)` and the list `edges`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `edges` list contains at least one tuple for the loop to execute. The variables `a` and `b` will be assigned the values of the first tuple in the `edges` list during the first iteration of the loop.

Given the context, we need to adjust the `edges` list to ensure it has at least one tuple. The values of `n` and `k` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself, but they must be consistent with the problem statement (i.e., `1 <= k < n`).

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree and must contain at least one tuple, `g` is a list of size `n + 1` where each element is an empty list**.
