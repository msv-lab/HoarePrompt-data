Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree. `g` is a list of size `n + 1` where each element is a list containing the adjacent vertices for each vertex in the tree.**
