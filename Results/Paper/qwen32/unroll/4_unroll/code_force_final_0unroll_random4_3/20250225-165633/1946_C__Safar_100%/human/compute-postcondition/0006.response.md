To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop, we need to ensure that the condition `l <= r` is satisfied. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given:
- `l` is 1.
- `r` is `n // k`.

For the loop to execute, `l` (which is 1) must be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, `r` must be at least 1.

Since `r` is calculated as `n // k`, and `n // k` must be at least 1, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `k` (because `n // k >= 1` implies `n >= k`).

Given that `1 <= k < n`, the condition `n >= k` is already satisfied by the problem constraints. Therefore, no further adjustments are needed for `n` and `k` to ensure that `r` is at least 1.

Thus, the state right before the loop can proceed without any changes.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree. `g` is a list of size `n + 1` where each element is a list containing the adjacent vertices for each vertex in the tree. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is `n // k`.**
