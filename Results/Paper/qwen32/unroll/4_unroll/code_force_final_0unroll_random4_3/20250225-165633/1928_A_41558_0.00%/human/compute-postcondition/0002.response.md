To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code for each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the loop:

1. For each iteration, two integers `a` and `b` are read from the input.
2. The code then checks:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`), it prints 'NO'.
   - If `a` is exactly half of `b` (`a / 2 == b`) or `b` is exactly half of `a` (`b / 2 == a`), it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Given that `n` is the number of test cases, the loop will execute `n` times. After each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input for the next test case. Since the values of `a` and `b` are only used within the loop and do not affect any other variables outside the loop, the final output state will simply be the series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case.

Since the state of `t`, `a`, and `b` outside the loop is not affected by the loop, and the output is determined solely by the inputs for each test case, the output state can be described as a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each of the `n` test cases.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each of the n test cases based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
