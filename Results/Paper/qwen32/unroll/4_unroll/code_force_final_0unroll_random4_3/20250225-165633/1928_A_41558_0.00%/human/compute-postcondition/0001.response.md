In the given task, we need to ensure that the for loop can execute based on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n):`, which means the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and its value before the loop starts is not relevant because it gets initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

The other variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop's execution criteria.

So, the only state we need to adjust is `n` to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0**
