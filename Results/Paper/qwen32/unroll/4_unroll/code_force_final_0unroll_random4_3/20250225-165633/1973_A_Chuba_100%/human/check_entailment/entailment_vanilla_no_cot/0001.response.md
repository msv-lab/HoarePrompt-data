To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - Two players play against each other in a game.
   - The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0.
   - In case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
   
2. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the maximum number of draws that could have happened.
   - If the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games, output -1.

### Approach in the Program:
1. **Check Total Points:**
   - The total points across all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in the case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in the case of a draw). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the program outputs -1.

2. **Calculate Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used is: 
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the observation that the maximum number of draws is achieved when the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is minimized.

### Validation:
Let's validate this approach with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 0 (no games played)
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

2. **Test Case: 0 1 1**
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 1 (one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

3. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

4. **Test Case: 1 1 2**
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the second and third player, one win/loss between the first and third player)
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

5. **Test Case: 3 3 3**
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

6. **Test Case: 3 4 5**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 6 (three draws)
   - Output: 6 (Correct)

7. **Test Case: 1 1 10**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the second and third player, four win/loss games)
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify if the scores are inconsistent. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
