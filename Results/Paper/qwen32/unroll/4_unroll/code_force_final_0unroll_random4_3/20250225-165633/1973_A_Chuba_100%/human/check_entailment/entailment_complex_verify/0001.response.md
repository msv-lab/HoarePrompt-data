### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `p1 + p2 + p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to distribute an odd number of points among games where each game contributes either 2 points (one win) or 2 points (one draw).
   - This logic is correct based on the problem description.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `p1 + p2 + p3` is the total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` is the minimum points that `p3` must have scored if `p1` and `p2` did not contribute any points to `p3` (i.e., all points `p3` has are due to wins against `p1` and `p2`).
     - Subtracting this from the total points gives us the points that could be attributed to draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.
   - This formula is derived from the need to maximize draws while ensuring the scores are consistent with wins and draws.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played** (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`): The total points are 0, so the number of draws is 0, which is correct.
   - **All Draws** (`p1 = p2 = p3`): The total points are evenly distributed, and the formula correctly calculates the number of draws.
   - **Impossible Scores** (like `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`): The total points are odd, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Validation Against Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: `0 0 0` → Total points = 0, even → Draws = 0.
   - **Example 2**: `0 1 1` → Total points = 2, even → Draws = 1.
   - **Example 3**: `1 1 1` → Total points = 3, odd → `-1`.
   - **Example 4**: `1 1 2` → Total points = 4, even → Draws = 2.
   - **Example 5**: `3 3 3` → Total points = 9, odd → `-1`.
   - **Example 6**: `3 4 5` → Total points = 12, even → Draws = 6.
   - **Example 7**: `1 1 10` → Total points = 12, even → Draws = 2.

The program correctly handles all these cases, ensuring that the maximum number of draws is calculated accurately and that impossible scores are correctly identified.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify impossible scores based on the provided constraints.

Final: **True**
