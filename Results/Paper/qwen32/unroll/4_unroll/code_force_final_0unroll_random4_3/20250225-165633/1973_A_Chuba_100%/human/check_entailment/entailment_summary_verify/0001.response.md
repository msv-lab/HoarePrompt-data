Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to verify if the program correctly computes the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints.

### Analysis of the Program

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Three friends play chess games.
- Each game results in either:
  - 2 points for the winner and 0 for the loser.
  - 1 point each in case of a draw.
- Given scores \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- Determine the maximum number of draws or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent.

#### Program Logic:
1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The sum of scores \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) must be even. If it's odd, print `-1` because it's impossible to distribute points in a way that adheres to the game rules.
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If the sum is even, compute the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p_1 + p_2 + p_3) - \max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula aims to account for the points that could have come from draws.

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if the sum of scores is odd and prints `-1` if true.
- Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the given formula and prints the result.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - This part of the logic is straightforward and correct. If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so printing `-1` is appropriate.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p_1 + p_2 + p_3) - \max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)}{2}
     \]
   - **Interpretation**:
     - \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) is the total points.
     - \( \max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2) \) is the minimum points that \( p_3 \) must have scored if \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) did not contribute any points to \( p_3 \).
     - Subtracting this from the total points gives the points that could be attributed to draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.
   - **Validation**:
     - **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
       - Total points = 0 → Draws = 0.
     - **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
       - Total points = 2 → Draws = 1.
     - **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
       - Total points = 3 → `-1`.
     - **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
       - Total points = 4 → Draws = 2.
     - **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
       - Total points = 9 → `-1`.
     - **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
       - Total points = 12 → Draws = 6.
     - **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
       - Total points = 12 → Draws = 2.

### Edge Cases
- **No Games Played** (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`): The total points are 0, so the number of draws is 0, which is correct.
- **All Draws** (`p1 = p2 = p3`): The total points are evenly distributed, and the formula correctly calculates the number of draws.
- **Impossible Scores** (like `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`): The total points are odd, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify impossible scores based on the provided constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
