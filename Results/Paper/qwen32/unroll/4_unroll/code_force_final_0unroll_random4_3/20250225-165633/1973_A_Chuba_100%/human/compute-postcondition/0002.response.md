To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop processes each test case individually, and the output for each test case is either `-1` or a calculated result based on the scores of the three players.

Here's a breakdown of the loop logic:
1. For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players.
2. It checks if the sum of the three scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1`.
3. If the sum is even, it calculates the result using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
4. It prints the calculated result.

The output state after the loop finishes will be a series of outputs for each test case, either `-1` or the calculated result.

Since the problem asks for the output state in a specific format and does not require the actual outputs of each test case, we can describe the output state in terms of the number of test cases and the nature of the outputs.

Given that the initial state includes the number of test cases `t`, and each test case results in either `-1` or a calculated result, the output state can be described as a series of `t` outputs.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact test cases, we can describe the output state in a general form:

Output State: **a series of t outputs, each being either -1 or a calculated result based on the scores of the three players.**

For the sake of providing a specific example, let's assume we have 3 test cases with the following inputs:
- Test case 1: `1 2 3`
- Test case 2: `2 2 2`
- Test case 3: `0 0 0`

The outputs for these test cases would be:
- Test case 1: `-1` (since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is even, but the formula results in a non-integer)
- Test case 2: `3` (since 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is even, and the formula results in 3)
- Test case 3: `0` (since 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is even, and the formula results in 0)

So, the output state would be:
Output State: **-1 3 0**

But since the exact test cases are not provided, the most general form of the output state is:

Output State: **a series of t outputs, each being either -1 or a calculated result based on the scores of the three players.**
