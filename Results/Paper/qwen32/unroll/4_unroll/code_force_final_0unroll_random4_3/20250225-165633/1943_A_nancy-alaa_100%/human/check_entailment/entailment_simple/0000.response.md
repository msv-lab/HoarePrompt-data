### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the final MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

The given program seems to attempt to solve this problem by counting the occurrences of each number in the input array `a` using a `Counter` from the `collections` module. It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n` (inclusive) and checks for the first number that either:
1. Is not present in the array `a` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`), or
2. Appears exactly once in `a` and Alice has already picked a number that appears exactly once (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1 and first`).

However, this approach does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Optimal Strategy Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob's strategies depend on the sequence of their moves, not just the counts of numbers. Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, which means she should try to avoid picking numbers that would prematurely lock in a smaller MEX for Bob. Bob, on the other hand, should aim to minimize the MEX, which means he should try to force Alice into picking numbers that would lock in a smaller MEX.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic used in the program to determine the MEX is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the first number that is either not present or appears exactly once will be the MEX, which is not necessarily true given the optimal play by both players.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly determine the MEX under optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
