### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. However, the logic in the provided code does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and the code:

1. **Objective**: 
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and adding them to `c` (Alice) or removing them from `a` (Bob).
   - Alice starts first.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to add elements in such a way that the MEX is maximized.
   - Bob should aim to add elements in such a way that the MEX is minimized.
   - The key insight is that if an element appears an odd number of times in `a`, Alice can ensure it is added to `c` (since she goes first and can pick it on her turn).

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates over the range `[0, n]` to find the smallest integer that is either missing from `a` or appears exactly once.
   - However, this logic does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves determining which elements will end up in `c` after both players have played optimally.
   - Elements that appear an odd number of times in `a` will end up in `c`.
   - The MEX is then the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set of elements that appear an odd number of times.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
