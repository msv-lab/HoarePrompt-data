Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. It then prints the smallest integer that is either missing from the list or appears exactly once, while ensuring that if there are multiple such integers, the smallest one is chosen.**
