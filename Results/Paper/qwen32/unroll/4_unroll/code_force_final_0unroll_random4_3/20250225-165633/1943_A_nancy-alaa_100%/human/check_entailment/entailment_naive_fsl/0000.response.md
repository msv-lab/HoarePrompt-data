Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to achieve the game's score as defined by the MEX of the final array `c`. The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `c` by iterating through the numbers from 0 to `n` and checking if they are present in the array `a` using a `Counter`. However, the logic does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to build the array `c` and delete elements from `a`.

Here is a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

**Test Case:**

```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**

- Alice starts by picking `0`, so `c = [0]` and `a = [1, 1, 2]`.
- Bob picks `1`, so `a = [1, 2]`.
- Alice picks `1`, so `c = [0, 1]` and `a = [2]`.
- Bob picks `2`, so `a = []`.

The final array `c` is `[0, 1]`, and its MEX is `2`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**

```
0
```

The program incorrectly outputs `0` for this test case because it does not simulate the game's turns and directly checks for the MEX in the array `a` without considering the optimal moves by Alice and Bob.

The program needs to simulate the game's turns and build the array `c` accordingly to correctly determine the MEX.
