### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through numbers from 0 to `n` and checking their presence in the array. The logic hinges on the idea that the MEX (minimum excludant) of the final array `c` can be determined by finding the smallest number that is either missing from the initial array `a` or appears exactly once in `a`.

However, there are some flaws in the logic:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Optimal Play**: The problem requires both players to play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The provided program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not consider the optimal moves each player would make.
2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The program checks for the smallest number that is missing or appears exactly once, which does not necessarily align with the optimal strategy for both players. For instance, if the array has multiple occurrences of the same number, the optimal strategy might involve Alice and Bob removing elements in a specific order to maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.

Given the problem's requirement for optimal play, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the MEX based on the players' strategies.

### Correctness:
