Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i, `b` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for each i, and `c` is a list of `n` integers where c_i is the minimum of a_i and b_i for each i.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `c` is a new list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
