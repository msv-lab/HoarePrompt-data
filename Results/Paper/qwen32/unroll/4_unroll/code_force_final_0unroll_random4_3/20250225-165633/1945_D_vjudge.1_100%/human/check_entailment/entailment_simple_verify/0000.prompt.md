You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
Kirill is in a queue and can bribe people to move forward. He can bribe the person at position `j` to swap places with him, paying `a_j` coins, and additionally pay `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position `i`. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` which seems to be calculating the minimum coins Kirill needs to spend. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (the number of people in the queue), `m` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill), and two lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program creates a list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. This seems to assume that Kirill can choose the cheaper option between `a_j` and `b_k` for each person, which is not accurate according to the problem description.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of the elements in `c` from index `i` to the end of the array. This is used to calculate the total cost of bribing people from position `i+1` to the end.

4. **Minimum Cost Calculation**: The program iterates over the first `m` positions and calculates the minimum cost Kirill needs to spend by considering the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the suffix sum from `i+1`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program incorrectly assumes that Kirill can choose the cheaper option between `a_j` and `b_k` for each person, which is not correct. The problem description states that bribing a person at position `j` incurs a cost of `a_j` plus `b_k` for each person `k` between `j` and `i`. The program does not account for the additional `b_k` costs correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2
10 2 3
1 10 1
```
- For `i = 1`, the cost should be `10 + (1 + 10) = 21`.
- For `i = 2`, the cost should be `2 + 1 = 3`.

The correct answer is `3`, but the program will incorrectly calculate it as `min(10 + (1 + 10), 2 + 1) = min(21, 3) = 3`, which happens to be correct in this case but due to incorrect logic.

However, consider another test case:
```
1
3 2
10 2 3
100 1 1
```
- For `i = 1`, the cost should be `10 + (100 + 1) = 111`.
- For `i = 2`, the cost should be `2 + 1 = 3`.

The correct answer is `3`, but the program will incorrectly calculate it as `min(10 + (100 + 1), 2 + 1) = min(111, 3) = 3`, which again happens to be correct but due to incorrect logic.

A more illustrative counterexample:
```
1
3 2
10 2 3
1 100 1
```
- For `i = 1`, the cost should be `10 + (1 + 100) = 111`.
- For `i = 2`, the cost should be `2 + 1 = 3`.

The correct answer is `3`, but the program will incorrectly calculate it as `min(10 + (1 + 100), 2 + 1) = min(111, 3) = 3`, which again happens to be correct but due to incorrect logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for the additional `b_k` costs when calculating the total cost of bribing people. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

The program's logic is flawed and does not accurately reflect the problem description.
