The code snippet initializes a list `suff` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The only change is the introduction of the `suff` list.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i, `b` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for each i, and `c` is a list of `n` integers where c_i is the minimum of a_i and b_i for each i, `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers all initialized to 0.**
