Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; there are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5), an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and an array b of m integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is being executed as the main module (`__name__ == '__main__')`.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the number of test cases, which is an integer input by the user. All other conditions and variables remain as described in the initial state.
