The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`. Since `t` is already within the range that ensures the loop will execute, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; there are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)**
