Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. The logic used in the program does not properly account for the price increases that occur after buying tickets on a particular day and does not ensure that the minimum cost is achieved for all test cases.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Price Increase Mechanism**: The program does not correctly simulate the mechanism by which the price of tickets increases after a purchase. The price of tickets should increase by the number of tickets purchased on a given day for all subsequent days. The current program does not account for this price increase mechanism correctly.

2. **Greedy Approach Misapplication**: The program attempts to use a greedy approach by sorting the prices and then purchasing tickets based on the sorted prices. However, the greedy approach is not sufficient for this problem because the cost of future tickets depends on the number of tickets purchased on previous days, which affects the prices of all future days.

3. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The program's logic for handling the remaining tickets after purchasing the maximum possible tickets on the first few days is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the cost when the total number of tickets is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a binary search combined with a greedy strategy might be more appropriate. The solution should simulate the purchasing process day by day, taking into account the price increases that occur after each purchase, and ensure that the minimum cost is achieved for purchasing exactly k tickets.
