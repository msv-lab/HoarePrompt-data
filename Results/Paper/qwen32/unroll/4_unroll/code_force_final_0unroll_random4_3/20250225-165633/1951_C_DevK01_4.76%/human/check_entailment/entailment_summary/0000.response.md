### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem of purchasing tickets at minimum cost while adhering to the given constraints. However, there are a few issues in the logic that make the program incorrect.

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices in ascending order. This is correct because buying tickets on the cheapest days first minimizes the cost. 

2. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets**: The program calculates the number of days `q` it would take to buy `k` tickets if `m` tickets can be bought each day. This is done using `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`. This is also correct.

3. **Handling Full Purchases on Each Day**: If the total tickets `k` can be bought in full days (i.e., `n * m == k`), the program calculates the cost correctly by summing the first `q` days and adding the incremental cost due to the previous purchases.

4. **Handling Remaining Tickets**: If there are remaining tickets after the full days, the program attempts to handle this by popping the last element from the sorted list of prices and calculating the cost for the remaining tickets. However, the formula used to calculate the cost in the `else` block is incorrect.

Let's break down the `else` block:
- `w = N.pop()`: This removes the last (most expensive) price from the list.
- `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`: This calculates the number of remaining tickets to buy.
- `cost = mu * w`: This calculates the cost for the remaining tickets.
- The rest of the cost calculation is incorrect. The incremental cost due to previous purchases is not correctly applied.

The correct approach should be to buy tickets in such a way that the incremental cost is minimized. The program does not correctly handle the incremental cost when there are remaining tickets after the full days.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the `else` block, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
