Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i = 0 indicates that the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 indicates that the i-th cell contains a chip. It is guaranteed that in each test case, there is at least one cell that contains a chip.**
