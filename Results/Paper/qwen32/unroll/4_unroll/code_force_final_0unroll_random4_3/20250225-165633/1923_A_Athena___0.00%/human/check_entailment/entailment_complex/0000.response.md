### Reasoning:

The function's objective is to determine the minimum number of operations required to move chips so that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The function processes each test case independently.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers representing the cells.

2. **Trimming Free Cells**:
   - It removes leading and trailing free cells (0s) from the list `a`. This is done using `pop(0)` and `pop()` methods to remove 0s from the start and end of the list, respectively. This step ensures that the list `a` now starts and ends with a chip (1).

3. **Counting Operations**:
   - It then iterates through the modified list `a` and counts the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s). This count is stored in `res`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the count `res` which represents the minimum number of operations required.

### Analysis:

- **Trimming Free Cells**:
  - The trimming of leading and trailing free cells is correct because these cells do not affect the number of operations needed to group the chips together. They can be ignored as they are outside the range of interest.

- **Counting Operations**:
  - The function counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which directly corresponds to the number of operations needed to move the chips so that they form a single block. Each free cell (0) between chips requires one operation to move a chip into it.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles cases where there are no leading or trailing free cells.
  - It also handles cases where all cells are occupied by chips (no free cells in between), resulting in zero operations.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to group the chips into a single block by counting the free cells between the first and last chip in the list after trimming the leading and trailing free cells.
