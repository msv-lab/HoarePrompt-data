To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration:

1. The loop processes each test case separately.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a`.
3. It then removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`.
4. It counts the number of zeros remaining in the list `a` after the removal of leading and trailing zeros.
5. It prints the modified list `a` and the count of zeros `res`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state of variables `t`, `n`, and `a` changes with each iteration, the final output state will reflect the processing of the last test case only.

Output State: **the modified list `a` and the count `res` for the last test case.**

Given the format requirement, let's assume the last test case provided is:
- `n = 5`
- `a = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`

Processing this last test case:
1. Remove leading zeros: `a` becomes `[1, 0, 1, 0]`
2. Remove trailing zeros: `a` becomes `[1, 0, 1]`
3. Count zeros in `a`: `res` is `1`

Thus, the output for the last test case would be:
- Modified list `a`: `[1, 0, 1]`
- Count of zeros `res`: `1`

Output State: **the modified list `a` and the count `res` for the last test case, e.g., `a = [1, 0, 1]` and `res = 1`.**

Since the exact last test case is not provided, the output state is described in terms of the last test case's processed values. If the last test case were different, the values would reflect that specific case.

Therefore, the final output state in the required format is:
Output State: **the modified list `a` and the count `res` for the last test case.**
