You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i = 0 indicates that the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 indicates that the i-th cell contains a chip. It is guaranteed that in each test case, there is at least one cell that contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: the modified list `a` and the count `res` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of cells where each cell is either free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells between the first and last chip in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. Here is a detailed analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**:
   - The current logic simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip. However, this does not account for the optimal way to move the chips to form a single block.
   - For example, in the case where chips are spread out, the program does not consider the minimal number of moves required to bring them together optimally.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where chips are already in a single block or are spread out in such a way that the minimal number of moves is not simply the count of free cells between the first and last chip.

3. **Example of Failure**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     9
     0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
     ```
   - The program will output `3`, but the correct answer is `3`. However, the logic is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly. For instance, a more complex case like:
     ```
     1
     10
     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
     ```
   - The correct answer is `4`, but the program will output `5`, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is required. One possible correct approach would be to use a two-pointer technique or dynamic programming to calculate the minimal number of moves required to bring all chips together optimally.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == 1]
        median = positions[len(positions) // 2]
        res = sum(abs(p - median) for p in positions)
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the median position of the chips and sums the absolute differences between each chip's position and the median position, which gives the minimal number of moves required to form a single block.
