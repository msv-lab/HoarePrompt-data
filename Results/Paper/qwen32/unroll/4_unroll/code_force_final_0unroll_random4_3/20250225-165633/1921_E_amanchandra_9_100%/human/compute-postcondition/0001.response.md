The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given that the loop iterates `t` times, the state needs to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) are mentioned as part of the test cases within the loop and do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
