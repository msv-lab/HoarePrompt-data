Reasoning: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic used to solve the problem.

The game involves Alice and Bob moving their chips on a checkered board with specific movement rules. Alice moves downwards and diagonally down-left or down-right, while Bob moves upwards and diagonally up-left or up-right. The game ends when one player's chip lands on the other player's chip, or when a player cannot make a move.

The program logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`.
3. It then determines the winner based on the relative positions of the chips:
   - If Alice's initial row `x_a` is greater than Bob's initial row `x_b`, it prints "Draw". This is because Alice cannot move upwards, and Bob cannot move downwards, so they will never meet.
   - If `x_a` is not greater than `x_b`, it calculates `x = abs(a - c) // 2` (half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob).
     - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is non-zero (i.e., the vertical distance is odd), it calculates the possible horizontal range `l` and `r` for Bob's chip's column position after `x + 1` moves.
     - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is zero (i.e., the vertical distance is even), it calculates the possible horizontal range `l` and `r` for Alice's chip's column position after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Bob's chip's column position `b` (or Alice's chip's column position `b` in the case of even vertical distance) falls within the calculated range. If it does, the game can end with a win for Alice or Bob, depending on whose turn it is. Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

The program uses the conditions and logic correctly to determine the outcome of the game for each test case based on the movement rules and the initial positions of the chips.

Correctness: **True**
