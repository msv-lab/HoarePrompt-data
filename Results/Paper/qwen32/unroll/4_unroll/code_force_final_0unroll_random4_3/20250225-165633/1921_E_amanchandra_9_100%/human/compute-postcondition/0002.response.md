To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the logic inside the loop.

Here's a breakdown of the loop logic:
1. For each test case, six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are read.
2. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are assigned the values `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` respectively.
3. The condition `if a > c` checks if `x_a` is greater than `x_b`.
   - If true, it prints "Draw".
   - If false, it calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`.
4. If the difference `abs(a - c)` is odd:
   - It calculates `l` and `r` as the range around `d` minus and plus `x` respectively, clamped between 1 and `w`.
   - It then checks if `y_a` is within the range `[l, r]` plus one unit on both sides.
   - If true, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
5. If the difference `abs(a - c)` is even:
   - It calculates `l` and `r` as the range around `b` minus and plus `x` respectively, clamped between 1 and `w`.
   - It then checks if `y_b` is within the range `[l, r]`.
   - If true, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the output is determined by the print statements within the loop, the output state will be a series of strings ("Alice", "Bob", or "Draw") corresponding to the results of each test case.

Given that the initial state only includes the test cases and the loop processes each test case without modifying any external variables, the output state will simply be the series of results from each test case.

Output State: **a series of "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the results of each test case.**
