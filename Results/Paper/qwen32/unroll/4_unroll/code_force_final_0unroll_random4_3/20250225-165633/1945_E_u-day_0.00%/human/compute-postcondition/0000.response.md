Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the values returned from the function `func_1()`. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n still holds, but their specific values are now determined by the output of `func_1()`.
