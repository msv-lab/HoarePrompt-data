To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the variables. The loop iterates `a` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, compares them, and prints a message based on the comparison. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by the loop. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Here is the breakdown of the loop's behavior:
- If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'.
- If `b % 2 == c % 2` (both are either even or odd), it prints 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The loop does not modify any variables outside its scope, so the state of `t`, `n`, and `m` remains unchanged. The only changes occur in the printed output, which is not a part of the variable state but rather the side effect of the loop.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; a is an input integer. The loop has printed a series of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the comparisons of b and c for each of the a iterations.**
