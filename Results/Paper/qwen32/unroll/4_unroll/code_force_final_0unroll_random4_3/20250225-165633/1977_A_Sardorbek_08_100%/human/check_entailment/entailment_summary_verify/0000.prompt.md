You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then prints 'YES' if `n` is equal to `m`, 'NO' if `n` is less than `m`, 'Yes' if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for determining if it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the logic for handling cases where `b > c` is flawed.

Let's examine the problematic logic:
- If `b == c`, the program correctly prints 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `b > c`, the program checks if `b % 2 == c % 2` and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise prints 'No'.

The condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is incorrect because it doesn't account for all scenarios where `b > c` and `m` cubes can still be achieved. For example, if `b > c` and `b - c` is even, it means that the difference in the number of moves can be exactly balanced by adding and removing cubes in pairs, which is valid.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: `1 5 1`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add 1 cube, remove 4 cubes, and add 1 cube again, resulting in 1 cube).
- Actual Output: `No` (because `5 % 2 != 1 % 2`).

The correct logic should be:
- If `b == c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, print 'NO'.
- If `b >= c` and `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, print 'YES' (because the difference can be achieved by a series of adding and removing cubes).
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```
This corrected version handles all cases as per the problem description.
