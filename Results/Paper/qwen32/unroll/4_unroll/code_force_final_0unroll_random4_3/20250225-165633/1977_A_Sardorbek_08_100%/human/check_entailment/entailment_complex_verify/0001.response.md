Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine if after `n` moves, Nikita can have exactly `m` cubes.
- **Moves**: Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- **Constraints**:
  - `1 <= n, m <= 100`
  - `0 <= number of cubes <= n` (since we cannot have negative cubes).

### Key Observations:
1. **If `n == m`**: Nikita can simply add one cube in each of the `n` moves to get `m` cubes. **Answer: "Yes"**.
2. **If `n < m`**: It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves. **Answer: "No"**.
3. **If `n > m`**: Nikita can add cubes until he reaches `m` cubes, and the remaining moves can be used to balance out by adding and removing cubes. The difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of moves (add and remove) does not change the number of cubes. **Answer: "Yes" if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, otherwise "No"**.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program has the following logic:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Annotations:
- **State Before Function Call**: The input consists of `t` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `m`.
- **Inside the Loop**:
  - `b` and `c` are read as the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.
  - The program checks:
    1. If `b == c`, it prints "YES".
    2. If `b < c`, it prints "NO".
    3. If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes".
    4. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Evaluation:
1. **Case `b == c`**:
   - The program correctly prints "YES".
2. **Case `b < c`**:
   - The program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
3. **Case `b > c`**:
   - The program checks `b % 2 == c % 2` to determine if `b - c` is even.
   - This condition is correct because if `b` and `c` have the same parity, then `b - c` is even, and Nikita can achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is incorrect due to the `b < c` condition. However, the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
