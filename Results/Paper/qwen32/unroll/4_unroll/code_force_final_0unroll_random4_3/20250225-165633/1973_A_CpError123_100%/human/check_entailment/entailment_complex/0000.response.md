Let's analyze the program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The total points awarded in all games are the sum of the scores of the three players: `a + b + c`.
   - Since each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw), the total points must be even. If `a + b + c` is odd, it's impossible to have distributed these points through valid games, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - The variable `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`, representing the total number of games played since each game contributes 2 points.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `a + b`, representing the total points of the two players with the lower scores.
   - The maximum number of draws can be determined by considering the following:
     - The maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of games, which is `x`.
     - The maximum number of draws is also limited by the points of the two players with the lower scores, since each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players. Therefore, the maximum number of draws cannot exceed `y`.
   - Thus, the maximum number of draws is `min(x, y)`.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - The program handles the provided test cases correctly:
     - For `0 0 0`, no games were played, so the output is `0`.
     - For `0 1 1`, there was one draw, so the output is `1`.
     - For `1 1 1`, it's impossible to achieve these scores with valid games, so the output is `-1`.
     - For `1 1 2`, there were two draws, so the output is `2`.
     - For `3 3 3`, it's impossible to achieve these scores with valid games, so the output is `-1`.
     - For `3 4 5`, the maximum number of draws is `6`, so the output is `6`.
     - For `1 1 10`, the maximum number of draws is `2`, so the output is `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the logic and constraints provided in the problem description. It efficiently determines the maximum number of draws or identifies impossible score distributions.

**Correctness: True**
