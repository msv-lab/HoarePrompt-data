You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases; p_1, p_2, and p_3 are each integers representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores of players, and for each test case, it outputs either the minimum of half the total score or the sum of the first two scores, provided the total score is even; otherwise, it outputs -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all possible cases for the given problem. Let's analyze the program with some test cases:

The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
```python
x = (a + b + c) // 2
y = a + b
print(min(x, y))
```
However, this approach does not ensure that the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` can be achieved through a valid set of games. Let's consider a few cases where the program might fail:

1. **Case: (1, 1, 1)**
   - The program will output `1`.
   - However, it's impossible to have scores (1, 1, 1) because if one player has 1 point, it means they either drew with one player and lost to the other or won against one player and drew with the other. In both scenarios, the other two players cannot both have exactly 1 point. Thus, the correct output should be `-1`.

2. **Case: (3, 3, 3)**
   - The program will output `4`.
   - However, it's impossible to have scores (3, 3, 3) because each player can only get a maximum of 6 points if they play 3 games (2 points per win, 1 point per draw). The only way to achieve (3, 3, 3) would be if each player wins 1 game and draws 2 games, but this would require a total of 9 games (3 games per player), which is not possible with only 3 players. Thus, the correct output should be `-1`.

3. **Case: (1, 1, 10)**
   - The program will output `2`.
   - However, it's impossible to have scores (1, 1, 10) because the highest score a player can achieve is 6 points. Thus, the correct output should be `-1`.

The program does not correctly validate whether the given scores can be achieved through a valid set of games. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
