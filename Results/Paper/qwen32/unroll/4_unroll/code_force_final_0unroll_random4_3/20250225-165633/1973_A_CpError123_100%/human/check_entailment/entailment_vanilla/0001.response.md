Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of draws given the scores of three players. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the provided solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the total points `(a + b + c)` are even. This is a necessary condition because each game results in either 2 points (one for the winner and one for a draw) or 0 points (in case of a draw). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores through any combination of games, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Calculating Potential Draws**:
   - `x = (a + b + c) // 2` represents the maximum number of games that could have been played. This is because each game adds 2 points to the total score, and dividing the total points by 2 gives the number of games.
   - `y = a + b` represents the number of games that could have involved the player with the lowest score and the middle score. This is because these two players must have played at least `a + b` games to achieve their scores, as the player with the lowest score `a` could have lost `a` games and drawn `b - a` games (or all games if `a == b`).

4. **Determining the Maximum Draws**:
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `x` (total games) and `y` (games involving the lowest and middle score players). This is because the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games, and it cannot exceed the number of games played between the two players with the lowest scores.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no games were played (`a = b = c = 0`), correctly outputting `0` draws.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are impossible (e.g., `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`), correctly outputting `-1`.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify impossible score combinations.

**Correctness: True**
