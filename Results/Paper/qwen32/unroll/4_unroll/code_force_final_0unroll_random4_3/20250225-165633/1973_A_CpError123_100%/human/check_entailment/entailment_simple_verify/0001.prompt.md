You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of draws given the scores of three players. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the provided solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the total points `(a + b + c)` are even. This is a necessary condition because each game results in either 2 points (one for the winner and one for a draw) or 0 points (in case of a draw). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores through any combination of games, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Calculating Potential Draws**:
   - `x = (a + b + c) // 2` represents the maximum number of games that could have been played. This is because each game adds 2 points to the total score, and dividing the total points by 2 gives the number of games.
   - `y = a + b` represents the number of games that could have involved the player with the lowest score and the middle score. This is because these two players must have played at least `a + b` games to achieve their scores, as the player with the lowest score `a` could have lost `a` games and drawn `b - a` games (or all games if `a == b`).

4. **Determining the Maximum Draws**:
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `x` (total games) and `y` (games involving the lowest and middle score players). This is because the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games, and it cannot exceed the number of games played between the two players with the lowest scores.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no games were played (`a = b = c = 0`), correctly outputting `0` draws.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are impossible (e.g., `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`), correctly outputting `-1`.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify impossible score combinations.
