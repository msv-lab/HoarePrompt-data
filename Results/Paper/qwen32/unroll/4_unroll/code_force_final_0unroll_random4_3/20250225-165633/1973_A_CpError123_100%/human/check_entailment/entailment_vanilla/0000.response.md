Let's break down the problem and analyze the given program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Rules:**
   - Each game results in either a win (2 points to the winner, 0 to the loser) or a draw (1 point each).
   - The total points among the three players after all games must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (win) or 2 points (draw).

2. **Constraints:**
   - The scores are given in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have occurred, or determine if the given scores are impossible.

3. **Approach:**
   - First, check if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) are even. If not, the scores are impossible, and we should output -1.
   - If the total points are even, the maximum number of draws can be calculated. The maximum number of draws is half the total number of points, i.e., \( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2} \).
   - However, the maximum number of draws is also constrained by the sum of the two lower scores \( p_1 + p_2 \) because the highest score \( p_3 \) could not have received more points than the total points from the games involving the other two players.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of draws is \( \min\left(\frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2}, p_1 + p_2\right) \).

### Program Analysis:

Let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))
```

- **Step 1:** The program reads the number of test cases.
- **Step 2:** For each test case, it reads the scores \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
- **Step 3:** It checks if the total points \( a + b + c \) are even. If not, it prints -1.
- **Step 4:** If the total points are even, it calculates \( x = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \) and \( y = a + b \).
- **Step 5:** It prints the minimum of \( x \) and \( y \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly follows the logic described above. It correctly checks for the possibility of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the constraints.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
