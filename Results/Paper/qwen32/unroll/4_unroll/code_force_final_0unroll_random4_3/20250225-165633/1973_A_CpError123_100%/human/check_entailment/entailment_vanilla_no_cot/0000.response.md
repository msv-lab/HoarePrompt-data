Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores. Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

The logic in the program attempts to determine the validity of the scores and the maximum number of draws by checking if the sum of the scores is even and then using a formula to calculate the result. However, the formula used does not account for all possible valid configurations of wins and draws that could lead to the given scores.

Here are some specific issues and counterexamples:

1. **Incorrect Formula**: The program uses `x = (a + b + c) // 2` and `y = a + b` and then prints `min(x, y)`. This formula does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. For example, in the test case `1 1 2`, the correct answer is `2` (both games were draws), but the program will output `1`.

2. **Validity Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even, which is necessary for the scores to be valid since each game contributes 2 points in total (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw). However, it does not perform any further checks to ensure that the scores can be achieved by a valid set of games.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, in the test case `1 1 10`, the correct answer is `2` (two games were draws and the third game was a win for the player with 10 points), but the program will output `2` which might seem correct at first glance, but the logic is not robust enough to ensure this is the only possible configuration.

To correctly solve the problem, a more detailed analysis of the possible games and their outcomes is required. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = (a + b + c) // 2
        # The maximum number of draws is when the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is minimized
        max_draws = min(a, b, total_games - c)
        if a + max_draws * 2 > total_games or b + max_draws * 2 > total_games or c + max_draws * 2 > total_games:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the scores are consistent with a valid set of games and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
