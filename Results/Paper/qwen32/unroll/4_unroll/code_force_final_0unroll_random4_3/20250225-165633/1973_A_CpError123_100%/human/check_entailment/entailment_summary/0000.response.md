### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the scores of three players after a series of chess games. The key points to consider are:

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The sum of the scores (a + b + c) must be even because each game results in the distribution of an even number of points (either 2 to a winner and 0 to a loser, or 1 to each player in a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is determined by the minimum of two values:
   - Half the total points (x = (a + b + c) // 2): This represents the maximum number of draws possible if every game ended in a draw.
   - The sum of the scores of the first two players (y = a + b): This represents the maximum number of draws possible considering the scores of the first two players, as the third player's score (c) must account for the remaining points.

3. **Invalid Scores**: If the total points are odd, it is impossible to have a valid set of games that results in those scores, hence the program correctly returns -1.

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: Scores (0, 0, 0)
  - Total points: 0 (even)
  - x = 0, y = 0
  - Output: min(0, 0) = 0 (Correct)

- **Example 2**: Scores (0, 1, 1)
  - Total points: 2 (even)
  - x = 1, y = 1
  - Output: min(1, 1) = 1 (Correct)

- **Example 3**: Scores (1, 1, 1)
  - Total points: 3 (odd)
  - Output: -1 (Correct)

- **Example 4**: Scores (1, 1, 2)
  - Total points: 4 (even)
  - x = 2, y = 2
  - Output: min(2, 2) = 2 (Correct)

- **Example 5**: Scores (3, 3, 3)
  - Total points: 9 (odd)
  - Output: -1 (Correct)

- **Example 6**: Scores (3, 4, 5)
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - x = 6, y = 7
  - Output: min(6, 7) = 6 (Correct)

- **Example 7**: Scores (1, 1, 10)
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - x = 6, y = 2
  - Output: min(6, 2) = 2 (Correct)

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly handles all the scenarios and adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
