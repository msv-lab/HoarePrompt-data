Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` in the list satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i`. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
