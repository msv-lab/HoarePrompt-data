Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for all necessary conditions.

To determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color, we need to check if there exists a single color that can dominate the entire grid through the described operations. The correct approach involves checking if there is a single row or column that can be used to fill the entire grid with one color.

Here is a more correct approach:

1. For each test case, read the grid.
2. Check if there is a single row or column that is entirely 'W' or 'B'.
3. If such a row or column exists, then it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.
4. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if there is a row or column that is entirely 'W' or 'B'
        all_same_row = any(len(set(row)) == 1 for row in grid)
        all_same_col = any(len(set(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))) == 1 for j in range(m))
        
        if all_same_row or all_same_col:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This program correctly checks if there is a single row or column that can be used to fill the entire grid with one color, which is the necessary condition for the operations to make the entire grid the same color.
