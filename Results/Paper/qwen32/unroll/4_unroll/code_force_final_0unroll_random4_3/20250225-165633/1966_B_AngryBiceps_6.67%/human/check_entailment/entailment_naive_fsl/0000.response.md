Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description.

The problem description states that we need to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. The key observation here is that if there exists a rectangle (of any size) that contains both 'W' and 'B', then it's impossible to make the entire grid one color. If all squares in the grid can be partitioned into rectangles of the same color, then it is possible to make the entire grid one color.

The provided code checks only two conditions:
1. If the first and last rows of the grid are the same and consist of a single color.
2. If the first and last columns of the grid are the same and consist of a single color.

If either of these conditions is not met, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. There could be a scenario where the first and last rows and columns meet the conditions, but there is still a subrectangle within the grid that contains both 'W' and 'B', making it impossible to make the entire grid one color.

Let's consider a counterexample:
```
3 3
BWB
BWB
BWB
```
In this grid, the first and last rows and columns are the same and consist of a single color when considering only the first and last elements. However, the grid contains both 'W' and 'B', and there is no way to make the entire grid one color using the given operations.

Thus, the provided code does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. It only checks if the first and last rows and columns are the same and consist of a single color, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. There can be cases where the first and last rows and columns meet the conditions, but there is still a subrectangle within the grid that contains both 'W' and 'B', making it impossible to make the entire grid one color.
