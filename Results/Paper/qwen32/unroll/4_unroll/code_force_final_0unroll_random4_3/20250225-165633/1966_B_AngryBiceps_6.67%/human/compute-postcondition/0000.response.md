In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range is determined by the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. This integer represents the number of test cases, which is `t` in this context. The loop will execute `t` times.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that the input provided to `int(input())` is a valid integer within the specified range (1 <= t <= 10^4). The other variables `n`, `m`, and the grid are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, with `t` being a valid integer within the specified range. The values of `n`, `m`, and the grid will be handled within the loop body, which is not provided in this context.
