In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by the input value `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. 

The state provided before the loop starts includes:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

However, the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the value obtained from `int(input())`, which is `t`. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only thing we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes.

Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, and `t` is already specified to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, no further adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
