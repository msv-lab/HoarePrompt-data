Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases. It only considers the longest contiguous segments of the same element at the beginning and the end of the array and calculates the answer based on that, which is not sufficient to guarantee the minimum cost for making all elements of the array equal.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible values that can be used to fill the entire array and calculate the cost for each of those values. The optimal value would be the one that minimizes the cost. The cost for a given value is calculated as the total length of the array minus the sum of lengths of contiguous segments of that value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Dictionary to hold the segments of each value
        segments = {}
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] not in segments:
                segments[a[i]] = []
            if i == 0 or a[i] != a[i - 1]:
                segments[a[i]].append(1)
            else:
                segments[a[i]][-1] += 1
        
        min_cost = n
        for value in segments:
            total_length = sum(segments[value])
            min_cost = min(min_cost, n - total_length)
        
        print(min_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program calculates the minimum cost by considering all possible values in the array and finding the one that minimizes the cost when used to fill the entire array.
