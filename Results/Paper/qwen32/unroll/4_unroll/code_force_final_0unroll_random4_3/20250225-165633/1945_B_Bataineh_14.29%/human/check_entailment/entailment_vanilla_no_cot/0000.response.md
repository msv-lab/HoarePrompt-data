Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks from both installations that are visible simultaneously. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of fireworks visible within a period of `m + 1` minutes.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m + 1` minutes.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by both installations simultaneously within `m + 1` minutes.
4. Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the total number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Number of fireworks from the first installation
        count_a = (m + 1) // a
        # Number of fireworks from the second installation
        count_b = (m + 1) // b
        # Number of fireworks from both installations (overlap)
        count_ab = (m + 1) // lcm_ab
        # Total number of fireworks visible at the same time
        total = count_a + count_b - count_ab
        print(total)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by considering the overlaps between the fireworks from both installations.
