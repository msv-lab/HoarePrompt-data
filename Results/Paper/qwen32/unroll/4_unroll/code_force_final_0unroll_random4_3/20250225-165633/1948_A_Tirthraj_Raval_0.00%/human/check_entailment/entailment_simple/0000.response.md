### Reasoning:
The problem requires constructing a string where exactly `n` characters are special, meaning each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The given program addresses this by:

1. Checking if `n` is odd or even.
2. If `n` is odd, it outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string formed by alternating characters (each special character needs a pair to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor).
3. If `n` is even, it outputs "YES" and constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`. This construction ensures that every character in the string is special because each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's execution for the given example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 6` (even)
  - Output: `YES`
  - Constructed String: `ABABAB` (or any other valid pattern like `BAABAA`)
  - Each character is special as required.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 1` (odd)
  - Output: `NO`
  - It's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of length 1.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 2` (even)
  - Output: `YES`
  - Constructed String: `AB` (or `BA`)
  - Both characters are special as required.

The program correctly handles all possible cases within the constraints, ensuring that the output matches the problem requirements.
