You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, if n is odd, the output is 'NO'. If n is even, the output is 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in it. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC", the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be flanked by different characters.

3. **String Construction:**
   - If `n` is even, the program prints "YES" and then constructs a string.
   - The string is constructed using a repeating pattern of "AB" and "BA" to ensure that the number of special characters is exactly `n`.

### Correctness of the Program:
- **Odd `n` Case:** 
  - The program correctly identifies that it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters and prints "NO", which is correct.

- **Even `n` Case:** 
  - The program constructs a string with an alternating pattern of "AB" and "BA". This pattern ensures that every character in the pattern except the first and last of each block is special.
  - For example, for `n=6`, the pattern "ABBAABBA" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, which matches the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both the cases where `n` is odd and `n` is even. It ensures that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even and correctly reports that no such string exists when `n` is odd.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
