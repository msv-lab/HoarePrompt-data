Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` does not take any direct input arguments. Instead, it is expected to read input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^6. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input. `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. `root` is assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, root + 1):
    cnt = i * i
    ans += (n + i) // cnt


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
