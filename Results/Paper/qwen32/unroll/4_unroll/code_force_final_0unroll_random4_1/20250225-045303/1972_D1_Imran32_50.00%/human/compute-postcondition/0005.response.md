The task requires us to determine what will be printed given the variable `ans` in the initial state. Since the initial state only mentions `ans` for each test case without providing its explicit value, we need to describe the output in terms of `ans`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variable**: The variable `ans` is mentioned in the initial state but its exact value is not provided.
2. **Understand the Print Statement**: The print statement simply prints the value of `ans`.
3. **Determine the Output**: Since we don't have the specific value of `ans`, we describe the output as the value of `ans`.

Given the above points, the output will be the value of `ans` as it is.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value to be printed for each test case)**
