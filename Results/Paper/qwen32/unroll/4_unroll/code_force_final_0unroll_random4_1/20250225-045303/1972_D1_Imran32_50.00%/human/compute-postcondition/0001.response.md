Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any direct input arguments. Instead, it is expected to read input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^6. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input. `ans` is assigned the value of `n`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `ans` is now assigned the value of `n`, while all other conditions and variables remain as initially described.
