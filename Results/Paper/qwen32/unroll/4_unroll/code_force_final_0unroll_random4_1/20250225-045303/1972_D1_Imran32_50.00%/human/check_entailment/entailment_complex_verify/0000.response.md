### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Parsing Issue**:
   - The problem specifies two integers, `n` and `m`, for each test case.
   - The code incorrectly reads `n` and `k` (where `k` should be `m`), but even if this were corrected, the logic is still fundamentally flawed.

2. **Logic Issue**:
   - The problem requires checking each pair `(a, b)` to see if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The provided code does not iterate over all pairs `(a, b)`. Instead, it performs a calculation based on the square root of `n`, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - For the input `1 1`, the only valid pair is `(1, 1)`, and the code correctly outputs `1`.
   - For the input `2 3`, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`, but the code does not produce the correct output of `3`.

### Evaluation:

- The code does not implement the required logic to check all pairs `(a, b)` and verify the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The provided logic and calculation in `func_1` are entirely unrelated to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect based on the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
