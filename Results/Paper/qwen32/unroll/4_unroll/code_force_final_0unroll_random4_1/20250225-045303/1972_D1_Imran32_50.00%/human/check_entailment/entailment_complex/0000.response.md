Reasoning:

The provided program does not match the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the given program does not perform this calculation. Instead, for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (note that \(k\) is used instead of \(m\) in the function), and then calculates a value `ans` based on \(n\) alone. The calculation involves iterating up to the square root of \(n\) and adjusting `ans` by adding the integer division of \(n + i\) by \(i * i\) for each \(i\) from 2 up to the square root of \(n\). This calculation does not involve \(b\) or the greatest common divisor (gcd) in any way, and it does not correctly address the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
