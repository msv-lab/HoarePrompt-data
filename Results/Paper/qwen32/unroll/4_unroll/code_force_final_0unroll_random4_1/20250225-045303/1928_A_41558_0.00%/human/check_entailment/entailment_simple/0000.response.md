Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key points to consider are:

1. **Odd by Odd Rectangles**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one dimension being odd. These smaller rectangles cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with integer sides because the total area remains the same, and the resulting dimensions would still include odd numbers, which cannot form a new distinct rectangle (other than a rotation).

2. **Equal Halves**: If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\), then cutting the rectangle into two equal halves results in two rectangles of the same size, which can only rearrange into the same \(a \times b\) rectangle (or its rotation).

3. **Other Cases**: For all other cases, it is possible to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a different rectangle. This is because either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, allowing for a cut that results in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a new rectangle configuration.

The provided code correctly implements these conditions:
- It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, in which case it prints 'NO'.
- It checks if \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\), in which case it prints 'NO'.
- For all other cases, it prints 'YES'.

The code logic matches the problem requirements, and the conditions are correctly evaluated.

Correctness: **True**
