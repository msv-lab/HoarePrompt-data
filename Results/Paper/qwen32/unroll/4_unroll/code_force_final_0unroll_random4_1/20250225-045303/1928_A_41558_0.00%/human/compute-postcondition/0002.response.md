The given code snippet is a loop that iterates `n` times, where for each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then checks specific conditions on these integers and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions. The loop does not modify the values of `t` or `n`. It only processes the input pairs `(a, b)` for each iteration.

Since the loop processes each pair independently and does not retain any state across iterations, the only effect of the loop is the printed output for each pair. After the loop finishes, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and there are no other variables modified by the loop that need to be included in the output state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; n is an input integer. The loop has finished executing, and for each of the n iterations, 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed based on the conditions provided.**
