Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logic error in the conditions for determining whether Bob can form another rectangle. Specifically, the conditions do not correctly handle all cases where Bob can indeed form another rectangle.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the issues in the program:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He then tries to form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can always form another rectangle.
     - For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged into a 4x3 rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle because each cut will result in at least one dimension of the smaller rectangles being 1, and rearranging two 1xodd rectangles will not form a new rectangle.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle.
   - However, the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is incorrect. This condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is not relevant to the problem. This condition should be removed.
   - The program should simply check if at least one dimension is even, in which case Bob can form another rectangle.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if at least one of the dimensions is even, which is the correct condition for Bob to be able to form another rectangle.
