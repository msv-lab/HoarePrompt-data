To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. The loop processes each test case by reading three scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and then determining the result based on certain conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the loop does:

1. **Check if the sum of scores is odd**: If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
2. **Check if `p3` is the sum of `p1` and `p2`**: If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
3. **Find the maximum possible score for the winner**: If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it calculates the possible scores and finds the maximum score for the winner by iterating through possible values of `cur` from `low` to `high`.

The loop does not modify the initial variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` directly. Instead, it reads new values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` in each iteration from the input and processes them.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and does not retain any state between iterations other than the input values for the current test case, the output state after all iterations will simply be the results printed for each test case.

However, the problem asks for the output state in a format similar to the initial execution state, which contains only the initial values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. Since the loop does not change these initial values, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Thus, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **the initial values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.**
