### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players after a series of chess games. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis of the program to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` must be even because each game either adds 2 points (in case of a win and a loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, the program correctly outputs `-1` as it indicates an impossible scenario.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score `p3` could have been achieved by winning all games against the other two players, and any remaining points could be from draws among the other two players.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates the possible draws using a loop. It iterates through possible values of draws and checks if the scores can be consistent with the given conditions.
   - The loop checks if the remaining points after accounting for draws (`p1 - cur` and `p2 - (p3 - cur)`) are consistent and valid.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where no games were played (`0 0 0`), where a single draw occurred (`0 1 1`), and where the scores are impossible (`1 1 1`).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It ensures that the sum of scores is even and calculates the maximum possible draws based on the given scores. The logic used is consistent with the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
