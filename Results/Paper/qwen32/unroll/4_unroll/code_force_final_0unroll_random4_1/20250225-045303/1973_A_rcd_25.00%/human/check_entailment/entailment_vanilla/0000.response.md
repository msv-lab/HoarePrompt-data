Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Score Comparison**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), it implies that the player with `p3` could have won all the games against the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws is the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), as all other games could have ended in draws between the other two players.

4. **Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program calculates the possible number of draws using a loop.
   - It calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws (`cur`) such that the remaining points for `p1` and `p2` could be distributed in a way that is consistent with the total points being even and the scores being achievable through a series of games.
   - If a valid number of draws is found, it prints the total number of draws (`p1 - cur + p3`).
   - If no valid number of draws is found in the loop, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness Analysis

- The program correctly handles the case where the total points are odd, outputting `-1` as required.
- It correctly handles the case where `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, outputting `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
- The loop for calculating the number of draws seems to be designed to find a valid distribution of points, but it needs careful verification to ensure it covers all possible scenarios correctly.

However, there is a potential issue with the loop logic. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` might not cover all cases correctly. For example, if `p1` is much smaller than `p2`, the loop might not find a valid number of draws even if one exists.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program seems to handle most cases correctly but might have issues with the loop logic in certain edge cases. However, based on the provided examples and the logic described, it appears to be generally correct. To be absolutely certain, more thorough testing would be needed, but based on the provided examples, it seems to work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
