In the provided task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` represent the scores of three players and are provided for each test case. However, these variables are not part of the loop head; the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the range `t`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values are provided within each iteration of the loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
