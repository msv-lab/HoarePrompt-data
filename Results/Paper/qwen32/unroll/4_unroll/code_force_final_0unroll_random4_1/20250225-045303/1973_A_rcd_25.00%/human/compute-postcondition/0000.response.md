The code snippet provided assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `t`. This variable `t` represents the number of test cases, which was not previously defined in the initial state. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are part of the test case data that will be processed later, not defined or modified by this line of code.

Output State: **Each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases `t` is an input integer.**
