### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players given their final scores. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum of Scores**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed among the players, either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program proceeds to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), it means that the player with `p3` could have won all games against the other two players, and the maximum number of draws is the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`).
   - Otherwise, the program uses a loop to find the maximum possible number of draws. It initializes `low` and `high` based on the differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`. It then iterates through possible values of `cur` (representing the number of draws) to determine if the remaining points can be distributed among the players in a valid way.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`) by printing `0`.
   - It correctly identifies impossible score distributions by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, handling all edge cases and ensuring that the sum of the scores is even before attempting to calculate the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **True**
