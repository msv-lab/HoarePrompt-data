Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

The code attempts to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the scores of the three players. However, there are specific scenarios where the code fails to provide the correct output.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
0 0 2
```
In this case, the scores are 0, 0, and 2. This means that one player must have won two games against the other two players, and no draws could have occurred. However, the code will output 0 for this case, which is incorrect.

Another problematic test case is:
```
1
1 1 4
```
Here, the scores are 1, 1, and 4. This is impossible because the maximum points a player can get is 6 (if they win all three games). The code will output 1 for this case, which is incorrect.

Let's look at the code logic again:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
```

The code checks if the sum of the scores is even, which is a good start. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the scores are not achievable with a valid set of games. For example, it does not check if the scores exceed the maximum possible points (6 points if a player wins all three games).

The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is also flawed. The code does not correctly account for all possible combinations of wins and draws that could lead to the given scores.

To fix these issues, the code needs to include additional checks for the validity of the scores and a more robust method for calculating the maximum number of draws.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these edge cases.
