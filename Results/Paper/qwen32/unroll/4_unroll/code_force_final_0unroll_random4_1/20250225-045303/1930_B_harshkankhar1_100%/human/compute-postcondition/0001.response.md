The given code snippet reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a` for each test case. The initial state describes that `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n for each test case. After executing the code, the elements at even indices of `a` will be in reverse order.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list where the elements at even indices are reversed compared to the original list.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` for each test case will have its even-indexed elements reversed, while the odd-indexed elements remain unchanged.
