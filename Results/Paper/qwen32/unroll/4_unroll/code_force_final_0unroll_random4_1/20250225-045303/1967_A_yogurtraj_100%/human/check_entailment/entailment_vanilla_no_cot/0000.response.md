Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for determining the maximum score is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where additional cards need to be distributed to maximize the number of permutations of length `n` in the rearranged array. The approach taken in the code does not ensure that the final arrangement of cards will yield the maximum number of valid subarrays.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to focus on balancing the card counts to ensure that we can form as many permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` as possible. This involves distributing the additional `k` cards in a way that minimizes the difference between the maximum and minimum card counts, which is a more complex task than the current implementation addresses.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach, possibly using binary search or a greedy algorithm to determine the optimal distribution of the additional cards.
