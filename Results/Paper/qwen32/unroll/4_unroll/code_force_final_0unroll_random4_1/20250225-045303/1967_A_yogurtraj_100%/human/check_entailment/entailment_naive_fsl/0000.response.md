Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum score as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program seems to be trying to equalize the counts of each card type by distributing the available `k` cards, but it doesn't correctly calculate the number of valid permutations of length `n` that can be formed.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 3
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
With 3 cards of each type (1, 2, and 3), we already have a permutation `[1, 2, 3]` which is a permutation of `[1, 2, 3]`. No additional cards are needed, so the maximum score is `1`.

**Program Output:**
The program will output `7` for this test case, which is incorrect.

The program's logic seems to be focused on equalizing the counts of the card types by distributing the `k` cards, but it doesn't correctly compute the number of valid permutations of length `n` that can be formed. The program does not properly account for the combinatorial aspect of forming permutations and counting them.

Another issue is that the program does not handle cases where `k` is very large or where the card counts are already sufficient to form multiple permutations without needing additional cards.

Thus, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
