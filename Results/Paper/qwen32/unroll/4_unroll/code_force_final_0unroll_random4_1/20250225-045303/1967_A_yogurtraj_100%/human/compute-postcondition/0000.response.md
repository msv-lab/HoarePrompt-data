The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop iterates over the range of `int(input())`, which means it depends on the value provided by the input function.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1. Since `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and `t` likely represents the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that allows the loop to execute.

Therefore, to guarantee that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that the input value is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `int(input())` returns a value greater than or equal to 1**
