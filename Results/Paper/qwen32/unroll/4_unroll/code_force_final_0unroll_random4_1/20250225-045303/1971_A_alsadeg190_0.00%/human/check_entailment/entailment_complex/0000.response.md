Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The problem specifies that for each test case, the program should output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. However, the program currently outputs the larger of the two numbers first, followed by the smaller one. This is the opposite of what is required.

For example, for the input pair (1, 9), the program outputs "9 1" instead of "1 9". Similarly, for the input pair (8, 4), the program outputs "8 4" instead of "4 8". This happens for all test cases where x is not equal to y.

Correctness: **False**
