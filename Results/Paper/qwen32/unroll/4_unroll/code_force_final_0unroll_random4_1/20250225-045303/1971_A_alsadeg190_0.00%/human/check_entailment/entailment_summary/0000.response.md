Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to output the minimum and maximum of two integers for each of the given test cases. However, based on the execution summary, it seems that the program is actually printing the larger number first and then the smaller number, which is the opposite of what is required. The correct behavior should be to print the minimum number first, followed by the maximum number.

For example, for the input pair (1, 9), the program should output "1 9", but according to the execution summary, it is outputting "9 1", which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
