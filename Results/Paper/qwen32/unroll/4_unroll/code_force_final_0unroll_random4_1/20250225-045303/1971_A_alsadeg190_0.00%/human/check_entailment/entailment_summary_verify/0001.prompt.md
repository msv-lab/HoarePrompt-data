You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` and prints the larger of the two followed by the smaller one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

The problem requires the following steps:
1. Read the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, read two integers, `x` and `y`.
3. Output the minimum of `x` and `y`, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

The code does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases and stores it in `x`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers and stores them in `x` and `y`.
3. It checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. If false, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

However, there is a logical error in the code. The condition `if x > y` is incorrect because it prints `x` first when `x` is greater than `y`, which is the opposite of what is required. The correct condition should be `if x > y` to print `y` first, followed by `x`, and `else` to print `x` followed by `y`.

The correct condition should be:
```python
if x > y:
    print(y, x)
else:
    print(x, y)
```

Thus, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly output the minimum and maximum values in the required order.

Correctness: **False**
