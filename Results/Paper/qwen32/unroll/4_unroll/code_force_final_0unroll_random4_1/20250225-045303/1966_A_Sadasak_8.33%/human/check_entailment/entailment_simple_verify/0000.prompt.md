You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the described operations. Let's analyze why:

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a frequency table of the card numbers, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and incorrect for the problem. The frequency table should just count the occurrences of each card number.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the frequency table values, which is not a valid condition to determine the minimum number of cards.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle cases where all cards are the same or when there are multiple card numbers with frequencies greater than `k`.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- For each card number, determine how many times we can perform the operation (i.e., divide the frequency by `k` and take the integer part).
- The number of cards left for each card number will be the remainder of the frequency divided by `k`.
- Sum these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Example

Let's consider the first test case:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
- Frequencies: `4 -> 3`, `1 -> 2`
- For `4`: We can perform the operation once (`3 // 3 = 1`), leaving `3 % 3 = 0` cards.
- For `1`: We cannot perform the operation (`2 // 3 = 0`), leaving `2 % 3 = 2` cards.
- Total cards left: `0 + 2 = 2`

### Revised Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for freq in frequency_table.values():
        min_cards += freq % k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This program correctly computes the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder of the frequency of each card number divided by `k`.
