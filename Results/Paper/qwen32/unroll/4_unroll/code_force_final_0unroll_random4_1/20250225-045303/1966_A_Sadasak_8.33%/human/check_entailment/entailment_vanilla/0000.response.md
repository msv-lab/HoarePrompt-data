Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap
The task is to minimize the number of cards in a hand by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any numbers. The goal is to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integer `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the minimum number of cards remains `n`.
   - If `k == n`, we can perform one operation to reduce the number of cards to `k-1`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the frequency of each card number, but with a twist: it caps the frequency at `k` for each card number.
   - This is likely intended to simplify the problem by limiting the number of cards of any single number to `k`.

4. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cards:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary.
   - If `k` is found in the values, it prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the original number of cards `n`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This does not help in determining the minimum number of cards.
   - The correct approach would involve determining how many complete sets of `k` cards can be formed for each card number and then calculating the remaining cards after performing the operations.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards:**
   - Checking if `k` is in the frequency values does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards.
   - The logic should involve calculating the remainder when the frequency of each card number is divided by `k` and summing these remainders.

### Correct Approach

For each card number, calculate the remainder when its frequency is divided by `k`. The sum of these remainders gives the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can remain. The frequency calculation and the logic to determine the minimum number of cards are incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
