Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is `n`, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`.**
