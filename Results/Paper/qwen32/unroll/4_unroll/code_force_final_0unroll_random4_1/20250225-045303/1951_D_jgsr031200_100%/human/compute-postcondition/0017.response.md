Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State
1. **n** is 0.
2. **k** is `k` (it's a variable, not a specific value).
3. **costs** is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
4. **h** is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + k - 1`.
5. It is mentioned that **h** is greater than or equal to **k**.

### Calculation of Variables
1. **costs**:
   - Since `n` is 0, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]` which simplifies to `[1 - k, 1]`.
2. **h**:
   - `h` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + k - 1`.
   - Substituting `n` as 0, we get `h = 0 // (0 - k + 1) + k - 1`.
   - This simplifies to `h = 0 // (1 - k) + k - 1`.
   - Since any number divided by a non-zero number is 0, `h` becomes `0 + k - 1` which simplifies to `h = k - 1`.

However, the precondition states that **h** is greater than or equal to **k**. This means there might be a contradiction unless `k` is a specific value that satisfies this condition. But since the print statement does not depend on the values of `costs` or `h`, we can ignore this contradiction for the purpose of determining the print statement's output.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Output
The print statement simply prints the string 'YES'. There are no variables involved in the print statement that need to be evaluated further.

Output: **YES**
