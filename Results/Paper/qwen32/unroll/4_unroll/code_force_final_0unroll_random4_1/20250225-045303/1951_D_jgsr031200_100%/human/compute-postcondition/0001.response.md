Given the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers and that their current values are equal (`n = k`). However, the `print` statement in the code does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values**:
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

2. **Analyze the Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
   - This statement does not reference `n` or `k` directly.

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, it will always print `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
