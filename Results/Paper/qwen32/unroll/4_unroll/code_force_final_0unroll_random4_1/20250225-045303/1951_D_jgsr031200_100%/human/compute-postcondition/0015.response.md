Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is `k` (it is not explicitly defined as a specific number, so it remains as `k`).
   - `costs` is `[1, 1]`.
   - `h` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + k - 1`. Given `n` is 0, this simplifies to `0 // (0 - k + 1) + k - 1`, which further simplifies to `0 // (1 - k) + k - 1`. Since `n` is 0, the division `0 // (1 - k)` will always be `0` regardless of the value of `k`. Therefore, `h` simplifies to `0 + k - 1`, which is `k - 1`.
   - It is also mentioned that `h` is less than `k`, which aligns with `h = k - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the print statement, it is straightforward that the output will be the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h` do not influence the print statement because it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **NO**
