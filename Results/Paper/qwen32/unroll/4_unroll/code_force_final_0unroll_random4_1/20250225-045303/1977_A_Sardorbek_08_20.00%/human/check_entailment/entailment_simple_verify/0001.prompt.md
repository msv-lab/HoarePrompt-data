You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem asks whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.

### Key Points
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**:
   - Adding 1 cube: `+1`
   - Removing 1 cube: `-1`
3. **Final State**: We need to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `0 <= m <= n` because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus, the parity (even or odd) of the number of cubes alternates with each move.

### Correctness Criteria
For a given `n` and `m`:
- If `n < m`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, it's possible because we can make an even number of moves to adjust from 0 to `m` cubes.
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, it's impossible because we can't achieve an odd difference with an even number of moves.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does nothing and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Issues in the Program
1. **Variable `a` Misuse**: The variable `a` (which holds the number of test cases) is incorrectly used in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2`. It should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to check the parity of `n` and `m`.
2. **Case Insensitivity**: The output should be in a consistent case (either all uppercase or all lowercase), but the program outputs "YES" and "Yes" interchangeably, which is acceptable per the problem statement but inconsistent.

### Corrected Logic
The corrected logic should be:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect due to the misuse of the variable `a` in the parity check. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
