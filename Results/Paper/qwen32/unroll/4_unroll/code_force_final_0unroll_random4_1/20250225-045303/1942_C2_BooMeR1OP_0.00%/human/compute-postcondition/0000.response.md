The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state specifies the ranges and constraints for these variables. After executing the given code, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be set based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now set according to the input, while the constraints and conditions on these variables remain the same. The second line of input, which contains `x` distinct integers, is not affected by this code snippet and will be processed separately.
