You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's analyze each function to determine if they meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Function `func_1(a)`:
This function checks if the array `a` can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by performing the described operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).

1. **Sorting the Array**: The function first creates a sorted version of the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
2. **Concatenating the Array**: The function then concatenates the array `a` with itself, resulting in `concatenated_a`.
3. **Checking Subarrays**: The function iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length equal to `a` matches `sorted_a`. If a match is found, it means that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by performing the operation, and the function returns 'Yes'. If no match is found after checking all possible subarrays, it returns 'No'.

### Function `func_2()`:
This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct. By concatenating the array with itself, it ensures that any possible rotation of the array is checked against the sorted version. If any rotation matches the sorted version, it confirms that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order.
- The function handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the input and processing each test case independently.

### Testing with Provided Examples:
1. **First Test Case**: `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - Sorted version: `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
   - Concatenated version: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - No subarray of length 6 matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'No'.

2. **Second Test Case**: `a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted version: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
   - Concatenated version: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Third Test Case**: `a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted version: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Concatenated version: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Subarray `[1, 2, 3]` matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'Yes'.

Since the program correctly handles all provided examples and the logic is sound, the correctness of the program is **True**.
