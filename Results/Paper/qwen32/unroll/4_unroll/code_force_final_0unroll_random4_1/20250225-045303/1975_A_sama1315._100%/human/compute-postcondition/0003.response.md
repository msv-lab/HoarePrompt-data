Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`; `idx` is 0; `t` is an integer obtained by converting the string at index `idx` of `data` to an integer.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the integer value of the string at index `0` of the `data` list, while `a`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
