The code snippet provided initializes a variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the lists `a` or `data` in any way. Therefore, the lists `a` and `data` retain their initial values and states.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`; `idx` is 0**.
