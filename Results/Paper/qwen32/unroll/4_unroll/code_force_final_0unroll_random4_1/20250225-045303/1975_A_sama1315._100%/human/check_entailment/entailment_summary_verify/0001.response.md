Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the reasoning in the original assessment to ensure the correctness of the program.

### Problem Breakdown and Solution Explanation

The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly swapping a prefix and a suffix of the array. The key insight is that if such a sorting is possible, there must be a rotation of the array that is sorted.

### Analysis of `func_1(a)`

1. **Concatenation of the Array:**
   - The function concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a = a + a`.
   - This allows us to easily check all possible rotations of the array `a`.

2. **Checking for Sorted Rotation:**
   - The function then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches the sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.

3. **Return Values:**
   - If a match is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the operation.
   - If no match is found, it returns 'No'.

### Correctness of the Approach

The approach is based on the observation that any valid rotation of the array can be found as a subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`. This is because concatenating the array with itself essentially contains all possible rotations of the array.

### Testing with the Example

Let's verify the example cases:

1. **First Test Case (`[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`):**
   - Sorted version: `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.
   - Concatenated array: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
   - Checking all subarrays of length 6 in the concatenated array, none match the sorted version.
   - Correct output: 'No'.

2. **Second Test Case (`[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`):**
   - Sorted version: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.
   - Concatenated array: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`.
   - Checking all subarrays of length 5, we find that the subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted version.
   - Correct output: 'Yes'.

3. **Third Test Case (`[1, 2, 3]`):**
   - Sorted version: `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - Concatenated array: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - The original array is already sorted, so it matches the sorted version.
   - Correct output: 'Yes'.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation. It efficiently checks all possible rotations of the array by leveraging the concatenated array, and the function summaries and the original assessment align with this reasoning.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
