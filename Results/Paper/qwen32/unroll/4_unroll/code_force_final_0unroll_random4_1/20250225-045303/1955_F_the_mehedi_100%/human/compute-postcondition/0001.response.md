To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the code and understand how it processes each test case.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
3. It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
4. It checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd. If true, it increments `cnt` by 1.
5. It then iterates over the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, and for each count, it adds the floor division of the count by 2 to `cnt`.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

The output of the program is the sequence of `cnt` values for each test case.

Let's consider the output state in terms of the final printed values. The output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the `cnt` value computed for each test case.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the computed `cnt` value for each test case.**

Since we don't have specific values for the test cases, we can't provide a concrete series of integers. However, the format of the output will be a sequence of integers, one per line, corresponding to each test case.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3
```
The output would be:
```
3
4
6
```

Thus, the output state in the required format is:

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the computed `cnt` value for each test case.**
