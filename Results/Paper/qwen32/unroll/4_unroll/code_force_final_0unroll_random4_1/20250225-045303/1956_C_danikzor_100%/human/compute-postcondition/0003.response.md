To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the given code snippet and understand what it does for each test case.

The provided loop is executed for each test case, and for each test case, it prints specific lines based on the value of `n`. Here's a breakdown of what the loop does:

1. For each `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive):
    - It prints the first line: `1, i, *range(n, 0, -1)`.
    - It prints the second line: `2, i, *range(n, 0, -1)`.

The `*range(n, 0, -1)` part generates a sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`. So, for example, if `n` is 3, `*range(n, 0, -1)` will expand to `3, 2, 1`.

Let's illustrate this with an example where `n = 3`:
- For `i = 1`, the output will be:
  ```
  1 1 3 2 1
  2 1 3 2 1
  ```
- For `i = 2`, the output will be:
  ```
  1 2 3 2 1
  2 2 3 2 1
  ```
- For `i = 3`, the output will be:
  ```
  1 3 3 2 1
  2 3 3 2 1
  ```

So, for `n = 3`, the complete output will be:
```
1 1 3 2 1
2 1 3 2 1
1 2 3 2 1
2 2 3 2 1
1 3 3 2 1
2 3 3 2 1
```

Now, let's generalize this for any `n`. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, two lines will be printed, making a total of `2 * n` lines per test case. Each line will have `n + 2` numbers.

Given the initial state consists of multiple test cases, the output state will be a concatenation of the outputs for each test case.

Output State: **For each test case with input `n`, the output consists of `2 * n` lines, each line starting with either `1` or `2`, followed by the current `i` value, and then the sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.**
