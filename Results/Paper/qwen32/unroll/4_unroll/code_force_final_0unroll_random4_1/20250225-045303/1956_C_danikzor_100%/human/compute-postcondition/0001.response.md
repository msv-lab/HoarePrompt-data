The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

The initial state describes that `n` is an integer input representing the size of an n × n matrix. The value of `n` can vary between 1 and 500 for each test case.

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. **First Expression: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`**
   - This expression calculates a specific value based on the input `n`. It represents the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of squares} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
     \]
   - However, the formula in the code is slightly different: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This does not correspond to the standard sum of squares formula, but it does represent a specific calculation based on `n`.

2. **Second Expression: `2 * n`**
   - This expression simply doubles the value of `n`.

Given that `n` is an integer input, the output will vary based on the value of `n` for each test case. However, we can describe the output in a generalized form.

For any given `n`, the output will be:
- The result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`
- The result of the expression `2 * n`

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values for these expressions.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the size of the n × n matrix)**
