### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an `n x n` matrix by performing a series of operations that involve filling rows and columns with permutations of numbers from `1` to `n`. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum using no more than `2n` operations.

The provided program calculates the maximum sum as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which is the sum of all the numbers from `1` to `n` for each row and column, considering the optimal placement of numbers. This formula represents the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, each appearing `2n` times in the matrix (once in each row and once in each column).

The operations described in the program are:
- For each row `i` from `1` to `n`, it assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to row `i`.
- For each column `i` from `1` to `n`, it assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to column `i`.

These operations ensure that each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly `2n` times in the matrix, which is optimal for maximizing the sum. The program performs exactly `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case correctly by printing the maximum sum and the operations, as described.
