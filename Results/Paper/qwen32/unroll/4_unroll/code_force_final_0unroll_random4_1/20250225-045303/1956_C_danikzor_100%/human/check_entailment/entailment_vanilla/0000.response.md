Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. The operations involve filling a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - To maximize the sum, we want to place the largest possible numbers in as many cells as possible.
   - The maximum possible number in the matrix is n, and we want each number from 1 to n to appear as many times as possible.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1 Operation**: Fill a row with a permutation.
   - **Type 2 Operation**: Fill a column with a permutation.
   - We have up to 2n operations available.

### Strategy

The optimal strategy is to use Type 1 operations to fill the first n rows with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1] and then use Type 2 operations to fill the first n columns with the same permutation. This way, the diagonal elements will be filled with n, and the off-diagonal elements will be filled with decreasing values.

### Verification

Let's verify the provided program against this strategy:

1. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - The maximum sum for an n x n matrix is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
   - The number of operations is set to 2n.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program performs Type 1 operations on each row from 1 to n, filling each row with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].
   - The program then performs Type 2 operations on each column from 1 to n, filling each column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].

### Example Verification

For n = 2:
- The maximum sum is \( \frac{2(2+1)(4 \cdot 2 - 1)}{6} = 7 \).
- The operations are:
  - Type 1 on row 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 1 on row 2: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 1: [2, 2]
  - Type 2 on column 2: [1, 1]
- The resulting matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The sum is \(2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6\), which is incorrect based on the problem's example. However, the correct operations should be:
  - Type 1 on row 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 1 on row 2: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 2: [1, 2]
- The resulting matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  1 & 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The sum is \(2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6\), which is incorrect. The correct operations should be:
  - Type 1 on row 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 1 on row 2: [1, 2]
  - Type 2 on column 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 2: [1, 2]
- The resulting matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 2 \\
  1 & 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The sum is \(2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7\), which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program's logic is flawed because it fills rows and columns with the same permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], which does not maximize the sum correctly. The correct approach should be to fill rows and columns with permutations that maximize the sum, such as [n, n-1, ..., 1] for rows and [1, 2, ..., n] for columns, or vice versa.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
