Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are some key issues:

1. **List `L` is not populated**: The list `L` is initialized as an empty list and never populated with any values. This means that the loop that follows will not execute as expected because `L` is empty.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining the number of cards in each group**: The while loop intended to calculate the number of cards in each group of odd multiples is not correctly implemented. It is supposed to populate `L` with the counts of cards in each group, but it does not do so.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the k-th card**: The logic for determining the k-th card is flawed. The program attempts to iterate over the list `L` to find the group that contains the k-th card, but since `L` is empty, this part of the code does not work as intended.

4. **Incorrect formula for calculating card numbers**: The formula `pow * (2 * k - 1)` is not correct for determining the card number. The correct approach would involve calculating the position of the card within the group and then determining the card number based on that position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        pow = 1
        while True:
            m = (n + 1) // 2  # Number of odd numbers in the current group
            if k <= m:
                # k-th card is in the current group of odd multiples
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            k -= m  # Adjust k to be relative to the next group
            n -= m  # Reduce n to the remaining cards
            pow *= 2  # Move to the next multiple group

func()
```

This corrected program properly calculates the number of odd multiples in each group, adjusts `k` to find the correct group, and then calculates the card number based on its position within that group.
