The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range it iterates over is `t`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than or equal to 1. Given that the state before the loop starts already specifies that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once.

Since the other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`) are defined and used within the loop body, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing. The loop will execute `t` times, once for each test case.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
