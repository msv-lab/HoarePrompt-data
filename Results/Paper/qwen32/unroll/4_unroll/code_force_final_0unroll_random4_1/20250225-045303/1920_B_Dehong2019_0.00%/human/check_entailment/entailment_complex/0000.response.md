Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice removes at most `k` elements from the array.
- Bob multiplies at most `x` elements of the array by `-1`.
- Alice wants to maximize the sum, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- We need to find the final sum of the array after both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is a good start because it allows us to consider the largest elements first, which is crucial for Alice's strategy to maximize the sum.

3. **Initial Calculation (`ans1`):**
   - `ans1` is initialized to the sum of all elements in the array.
   - Then, the program subtracts the sum of the first `x` elements (which are the largest due to sorting) multiplied by 2. This simulates Bob flipping the signs of the `x` largest elements. The subtraction by 2 times the element is because we are subtracting the original positive value and then adding its negative value.

4. **Iterative Adjustment (`ans2` and `ans1`):**
   - The program then iterates up to `k` times, simulating Alice removing one element at a time.
   - For each iteration, it adds the `i`-th element (which is being removed) back to `ans1` (since it was initially subtracted when calculating `ans1`).
   - If `i + x < n`, it subtracts the `(i + x)`-th element multiplied by 2. This simulates Bob flipping the sign of the next largest element that wasn't previously flipped.
   - The maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` is taken as the result for that iteration.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly simulates the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob.
- By sorting the array in descending order, the program ensures that Alice can remove the smallest elements (which is optimal for her goal).
- By subtracting the largest elements multiplied by 2, the program correctly simulates Bob flipping the signs of the largest elements.
- The iteration allows the program to consider different scenarios where Alice removes different elements and Bob flips different elements.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and calculates the correct final sum for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
