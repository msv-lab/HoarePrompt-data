The code snippet provided initializes a variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `edges`, or `g`. The output state is simply the initial state with the addition of `c` being set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree, and `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index i contains all vertices directly connected to vertex i by an edge, `c` is 0.**
