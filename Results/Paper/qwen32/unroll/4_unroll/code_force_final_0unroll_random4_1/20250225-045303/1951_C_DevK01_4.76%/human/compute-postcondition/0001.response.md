The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its state does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` needs to be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is either 3 Â· 10^5, `m` is either 10^9, `k` is either min(nm, 10^9); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.**
