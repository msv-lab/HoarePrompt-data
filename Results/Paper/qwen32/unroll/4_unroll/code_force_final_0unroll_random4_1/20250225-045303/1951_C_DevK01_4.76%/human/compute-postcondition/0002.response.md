To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and what the final state looks like.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue
```

### Explanation of the Loop:
1. **Input Reading**: For each iteration, two lines of input are read:
   - The first line contains three integers: `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - The second line contains `n` integers which are stored in list `M`.

2. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - `m` is adjusted to be the minimum of its original value and `k`.
   - `M` is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Selection of Elements**:
   - The first `q` elements of `M` are selected where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
   - These elements are stored in list `N`.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the total number of elements selected (`n * m`) equals `k`, a specific formula is used to calculate the cost.
   - Otherwise, the largest element from `N` is popped, and a different formula is used to calculate the cost.

5. **Output**:
   - The calculated cost is printed.

### Output State:
The loop processes `t` iterations, and for each iteration, it prints a cost value. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `N` are re-initialized for each iteration and do not retain their values across iterations. The only persistent variable is `t`, which remains unchanged throughout the loop.

After all iterations, the state of the variables is:
- `t` remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `N` are not persistent and are re-initialized for each iteration.

Output State: **t is the same as the input integer; n, m, k, M, and N are reset for each iteration and do not persist.**
