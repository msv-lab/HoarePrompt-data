Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` (where 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, both consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and having the same number of digits). The function returns a result for each test case.**
