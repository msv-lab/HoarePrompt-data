Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` represented as strings with the same number of digits (1 to 9). For each test case, it constructs two new strings by comparing corresponding digits of `x` and `y`. If the digits are the same, they are added to both new strings. If the digits differ, the smaller digit is added to one string and the larger digit to the other, with a rule to ensure the first differing position is handled differently. The function prints two strings for each test case.**
