a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, k, ratings), such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and ratings is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows with 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The length of the list a is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
