Postcondition: **`a` remains unchanged as it is only being read, not modified. `x` remains the k-th element of the list `a`. `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and since `k > ind[1]`, `k` is greater than the second index in `ind`. `c` will be 2, as there are two elements greater than `x` before the loop broke. `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is 2. `ind[0]` is not equal to 0.**
