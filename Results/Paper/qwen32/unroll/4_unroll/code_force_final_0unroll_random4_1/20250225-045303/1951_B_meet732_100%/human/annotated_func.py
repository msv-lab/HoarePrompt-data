#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i's being distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `a` that contains test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. The function identifies the `k`-th element `x` in the list and finds the indices of the first two elements greater than `x`. Based on these indices, the function returns different values: `n - 1` if no elements greater than `x` are found, `k - 1` under specific conditions, or a calculated index based on the positions of the identified elements relative to `x`.
