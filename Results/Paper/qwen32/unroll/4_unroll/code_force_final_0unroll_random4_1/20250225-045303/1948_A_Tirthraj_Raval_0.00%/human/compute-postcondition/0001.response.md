The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the execution of the loop, we only need to ensure that `t` is set correctly for the loop to execute.

According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Given the constraint that `1 <= t <= 50`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `1 <= t <= 50`, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 50**
