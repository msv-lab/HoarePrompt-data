### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

**Key Points:**
1. **Special Character Definition:** A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. **Pattern Analysis:** If we consider the pattern "ABABAB...", each 'A' and 'B' in this pattern will be special because they are equal to exactly one of their neighbors.
3. **Odd vs. Even `n`:**
   - **Even `n`:** It is possible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters using the pattern "ABABAB...". For example, if `n = 6`, the string "AAABAACC" has exactly 6 special characters.
   - **Odd `n`:** It is not possible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters if `n` is odd because each special character requires a pair to be counted, and an odd number of special characters cannot be fully paired.

The provided code correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters.
- If `n` is even, it prints "YES" and constructs a string of alternating 'A's and 'B's of length `n`.

The code uses the pattern "ABABAB..." to ensure that every character in the string is special, which is valid for even `n`.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly handles both cases (odd and even `n`) as per the problem description. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
