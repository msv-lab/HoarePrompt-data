Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node via an edge; `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged; `leaves` is a list of nodes where each node has exactly one connection in the tree; `dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`; `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd.**
