Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of nodes in a tree (with the constraint 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5); `edges`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the nodes of an edge in the tree; and `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node where a stone is initially placed. The function returns 'Ron' in Case_1 and 'Hermione' in Case_2.**
