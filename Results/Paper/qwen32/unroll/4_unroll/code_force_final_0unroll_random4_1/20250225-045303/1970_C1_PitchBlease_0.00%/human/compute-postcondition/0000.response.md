Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n. `tree` is a dictionary or a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with n nodes. `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.**

In simple terms, the `queue` now contains one element, which is a tuple with the `start` node and a distance of `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
