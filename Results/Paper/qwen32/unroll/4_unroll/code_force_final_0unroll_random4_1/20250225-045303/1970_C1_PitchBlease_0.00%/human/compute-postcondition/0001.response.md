Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n. `tree` is a dictionary or a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with n nodes. `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `start` and `target` remain unchanged as integers representing node indices in the tree. The structure of `tree` and the contents of `queue` also remain unchanged. The new variable `visited` is introduced as a set containing only the `start` node.
