Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99), where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. `n` is the input integer representing the number of test cases. `result` is an empty list.**

The output state is that the variable `result` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`) retain their initial values and conditions.
