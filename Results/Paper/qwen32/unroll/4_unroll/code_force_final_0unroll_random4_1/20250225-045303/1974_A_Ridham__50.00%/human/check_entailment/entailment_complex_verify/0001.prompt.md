You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: The `result` list contains the number of screens required for each test case after processing all `n` test cases. Each entry in `result` is calculated based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons provided in the input for that specific test case. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, `extra_space`, and `extra_screen`) do not retain their values after the loop execution and are used only within the scope of each iteration.

    #This is printed: Each line contains the number of screens required for each test case (where each number in the result list corresponds to the number of screens needed for each respective test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a specified number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. For each test case, it calculates and outputs the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all the icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 15 cells.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We have screens of size 5x3, which means each screen has 15 cells.
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- Each screen can hold up to 15 cells, and cells can't be shared between icons.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`).

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1` (which is simply `x` since each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell).
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`).
   - If `y` is even, it can perfectly fit `y/2` screens (since each screen can fit 2 2x2 icons).
   - If `y` is odd, it needs an additional screen to place the remaining 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as the total cells available in the screens required for 2x2 icons minus the cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Placement of 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `space_x` (the total cells required for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then all 1x1 icons can be placed on the screens already allocated for 2x2 icons.
   - If `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`, the program calculates the additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - It calculates the extra space required as `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - It then calculates the additional screens needed based on the extra space required.

6. **Output**:
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
- It correctly calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
- It correctly calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons if they do not fit in the remaining cells.
- The program handles edge cases, such as when there are no icons of either type (`x = 0` and `y = 0`).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and handles the given problem requirements correctly.

**Correctness: True**
