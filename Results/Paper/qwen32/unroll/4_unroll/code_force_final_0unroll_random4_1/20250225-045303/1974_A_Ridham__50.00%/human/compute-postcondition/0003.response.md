Output State: **The `result` list contains the number of screens required for each test case after processing all `n` test cases. Each entry in `result` is calculated based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons provided in the input for that specific test case. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, `extra_space`, and `extra_screen`) do not retain their values after the loop execution and are used only within the scope of each iteration.**
