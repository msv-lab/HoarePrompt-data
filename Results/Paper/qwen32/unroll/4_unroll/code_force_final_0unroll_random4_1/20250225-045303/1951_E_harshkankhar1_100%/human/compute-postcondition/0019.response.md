Postcondition: **`s` is the input string provided by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`. The current value of `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, indicating that there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character. Additionally, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True.**
