### Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an `n Ã— n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from `1` to `n`.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of all elements in the matrix after performing the operations. The sum is computed using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each row or column will be filled with numbers from `1` to `n` in a specific permutation, and the maximum possible sum for each row or column is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n(n+1)/2`. However, the provided formula in the code is actually the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers, which is correct for the problem's context.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program performs `2n` operations: for each row and each column, it performs one operation to fill the row or column with a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - Specifically, the program does the following:
     - For each row `i` from `1` to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation and a Type 2 operation, each time using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Let's verify if the operations and the sum calculation are correct:
- The sum of the first `n` natural numbers squared is indeed the maximum possible sum for the matrix. Each row and column will contribute to the sum optimally by containing all numbers from `1` to `n`.
- The operations described (filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`) ensure that each cell in the matrix will be filled with a unique value from `1` to `n` in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum and generates the required operations within the limit of `2n` operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
