The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n Ã— n` matrix filled with zeroes. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on the formula provided and prints this sum along with `2n`. It then prints `2n` lines, each describing row operations on the matrix.
