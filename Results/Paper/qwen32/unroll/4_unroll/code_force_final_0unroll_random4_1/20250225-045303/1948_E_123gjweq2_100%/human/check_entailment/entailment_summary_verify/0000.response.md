### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries.

#### 1. **Global Variables**:
- The program uses global variables `arr` and `cliquess` which are not passed as parameters to the functions `func_1` and `make_array`. This is indeed a poor practice and can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with multiple test cases. However, this issue alone does not necessarily mean the program is incorrect; it just means it is not well-structured.

#### 2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**:
- The program calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`. This is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required. The problem requires the minimum number of cliques, and `ceil(n / k)` does not guarantee that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will be satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. This is a significant issue.

#### 3. **Incorrect Array Initialization**:
- The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized with zeros. The function `make_array` is supposed to assign distinct integers from 1 to `n` to `arr` and assign clique identifiers to `cliquess`. However, the initialization does not affect the correctness of the logic if the function correctly assigns values later. The function `make_array` does not ensure that the values are distinct or that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met.

#### 4. **Incorrect Logic in `make_array`**:
- The function `make_array` assigns values to `arr` in a specific pattern (first half increasing, second half decreasing) and assigns the same clique identifier to elements within the range from `left` to `right`. However, it does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. This is a critical flaw.

#### 5. **Incorrect Output**:
- The function `func_1` prints the results directly, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases. This is a minor issue compared to the logical errors.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
5 4
```

**Program Output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
2
0 0 0 0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
A valid output could be:
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```
or
```
5 4 3 2 1
1
1 1 1 1 1
```

However, the provided program does not guarantee such a correct output for all possible inputs. The logic in `make_array` does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the significant logical errors in the program, particularly the incorrect calculation of the number of cliques and the incorrect logic in `make_array` that does not ensure the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
