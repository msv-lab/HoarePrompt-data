To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's carefully analyze the loop and how it modifies the variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range `[left, right]` will be assigned.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` if `(right - left + 1)` is even, or `((right - left + 1) // 2) - 1` if `(right - left + 1)` is odd.

### The Loop:
```python
for i in range(mid):
    arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
    cliquess[left + i] = clique
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations:**
   - The loop runs `mid` times.
   - `mid` is the integer division of the length of the range `[left, right]` by 2.

2. **Modifications to `arr`:**
   - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`:
     - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is set to `small_element + i`.
     - This means that the elements from `left + mid - 1` down to `left` are being set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 with each step.

3. **Modifications to `cliquess`:**
   - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`:
     - `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.
     - This means that the elements from `left` up to `left + mid - 1` are being set to the `clique` number.

### Output State:
- `arr` will have its elements from `left + mid - 1` down to `left` set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `cliquess` will have its elements from `left` up to `left + mid - 1` set to `clique`.
- All other variables (`right`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`arr` has elements from index `left + mid - 1` to `left` set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`; `cliquess` has elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` set to `clique`; `right`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid` remain unchanged.**
