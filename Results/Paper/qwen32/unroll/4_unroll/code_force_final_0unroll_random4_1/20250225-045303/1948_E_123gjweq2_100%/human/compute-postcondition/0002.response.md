The code calculates `mid` as `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state, `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`. Substituting these into the formula for `mid`, we get `mid = ((right + 1) - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `mid = (right - left + 1) // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range [left, right] will be assigned; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.**
