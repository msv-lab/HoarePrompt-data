The code snippet calculates the value of `not_mid` based on the existing variables `right`, `left`, and `mid`. The value of `mid` is already given as `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The new variable `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`.

Let's substitute the value of `mid` into the equation for `not_mid`:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = (right - left + 1) - \left(\frac{right - left + 1}{2}\right) \]
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \frac{2(right - left + 1) - (right - left + 1)}{2} \]
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \frac{right - left + 1}{2} \]

Since integer division is used in Python, `not_mid` will be the integer part of the division of `(right - left + 1)` by 2.

Thus, the value of `not_mid` is effectively the same as `mid` if `(right - left + 1)` is even, and one less than `mid` if `(right - left + 1)` is odd.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range [left, right] will be assigned; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` if `(right - left + 1)` is even, or `((right - left + 1) // 2) - 1` if `(right - left + 1)` is odd.**
