t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and p is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function `ask(a, b, c, d)` is used to query the comparison of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d) where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and the function can be called at most 3n times per test case.
