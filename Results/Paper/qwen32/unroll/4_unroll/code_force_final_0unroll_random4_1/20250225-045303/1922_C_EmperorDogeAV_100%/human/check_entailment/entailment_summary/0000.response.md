### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem by determining the closest city for each city and then using this information to compute the minimum cost for traveling between any two cities. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Logic for Determining Closest City:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine whether the closest city to each city (except the last one) is the next city or not. If the next city is closer, it assigns `1` to the corresponding position in `prog_cities`; otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.
   - However, the function doesn't handle the last city correctly. Since the last city does not have a forward neighbor, the logic should be adjusted to account for this.
   - Moreover, the function does not account for the fact that each city should have a unique closest city, which is a constraint given in the problem.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the results of `func_1`. These prefix sums are used to compute the cost of traveling between cities using the closest city strategy.
   - However, the logic for calculating these prefix sums and using them to determine the cost of travel between cities is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest city for each city.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and processes each query by determining the cost of travel between the two cities based on the prefix sums.
   - However, since the prefix sums are not correctly computed due to the issues with `func_1`, the computed costs are incorrect.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is not correct. The logic for determining the closest city and computing the prefix sums is flawed, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

**Correctness: False**
