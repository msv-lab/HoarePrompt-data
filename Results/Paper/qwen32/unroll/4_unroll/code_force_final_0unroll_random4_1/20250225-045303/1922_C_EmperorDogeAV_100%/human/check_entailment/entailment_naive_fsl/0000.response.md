Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost to reach the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly calculates the cost to reach the next city or the previous city instead of the closest city. 
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest city by comparing distances to both the previous and next cities accurately.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect costs from `func_1`. This means that the prefix sums do not represent the correct cumulative cost to reach the closest cities in the forward and backward directions.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**:
   - The code uses the prefix sums to calculate the cost between two cities, but since the prefix sums are based on incorrect costs, the results of the queries are also incorrect.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 3 5
2
1 3
3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- To travel from city 1 to city 3, you can go from city 1 to city 2 (cost 2) and then from city 2 to city 3 (cost 2), total cost 2.
- To travel from city 3 to city 1, you can go from city 3 to city 2 (cost 2) and then from city 2 to city 1 (cost 2), total cost 2.

However, the provided program will likely output incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the closest cities and their associated costs, leading to incorrect results for the queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
