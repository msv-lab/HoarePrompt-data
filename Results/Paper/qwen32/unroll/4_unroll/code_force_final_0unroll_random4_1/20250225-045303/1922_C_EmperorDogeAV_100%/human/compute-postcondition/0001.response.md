The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set correctly for the loop to execute. The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (i.e., `n - 1` times). To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2 because if `n` is 1, the loop will not execute.

Given the context, `n` here seems to be the number of cities for a specific test case, and `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` initialized with zeros. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n), `n` is an integer representing the number of cities in the current sublist of `cities` and must be greater than 1, and for each city, the closest city is uniquely determined. `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` initialized with zeros.**
