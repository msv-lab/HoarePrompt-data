cities is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n), n is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of cities in the corresponding sublist of cities, and for each city, the closest city is uniquely determined. The length of cities and n is equal to the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4). The sum of the lengths of all sublists in cities does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, there are m queries (1 <= m <= 10^5), and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n_i; x_i != y_i). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
