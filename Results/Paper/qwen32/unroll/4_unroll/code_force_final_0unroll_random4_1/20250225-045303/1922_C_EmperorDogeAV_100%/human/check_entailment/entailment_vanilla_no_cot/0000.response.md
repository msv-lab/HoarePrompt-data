Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it incorrectly calculates the closest city by only considering the immediate forward and backward cities. This is not sufficient to determine the closest city uniquely, especially for cities that are not adjacent.
   - The function should calculate the closest city for each city by comparing the distances to all other cities, but this is computationally expensive. Since it's guaranteed that each city has a unique closest city, a more efficient approach is needed. The problem constraints suggest that the cities are positioned in such a way that the closest city is always either the immediate left or right city, but the program doesn't handle this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect closest city distances. This means that the prefix sums will not correctly represent the minimum cost to travel between cities.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program assumes that the prefix sums can be used to calculate the minimum cost to travel between any two cities, but since the prefix sums are based on incorrect closest city distances, the results will be incorrect.

To fix the program, the closest city for each city should be correctly determined, and the prefix sums should be calculated based on these correct closest city distances. The problem constraints and the example provided suggest that the closest city is always either the immediate left or right city, which simplifies the problem.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_closest_cities(cities, n):
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest_cities[i] = i + 1
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest_cities[i] = i - 1
        else:
            if abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]) < abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]):
                closest_cities[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest_cities[i] = i + 1
    return closest_cities

def calculate_min_cost(closest_cities, cities, n, a, b):
    cost = 0
    while a != b:
        if closest_cities[a - 1] == b - 1:
            cost += 1
        else:
            cost += abs(cities[b - 1] - cities[a - 1])
        a = closest_cities[a - 1] + 1
    return cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest_cities = find_closest_cities(cities, n)
    m = int(input())
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        print(calculate_min_cost(closest_cities, cities, n, a, b))
```

This corrected version correctly determines the closest city for each city and calculates the minimum cost to travel between any two cities using the closest city information.
