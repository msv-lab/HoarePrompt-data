`num_tests` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This input represents the number of test cases, `t`. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
