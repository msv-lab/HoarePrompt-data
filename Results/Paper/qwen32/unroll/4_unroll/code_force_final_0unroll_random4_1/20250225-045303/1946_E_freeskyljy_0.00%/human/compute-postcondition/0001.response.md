The code snippet `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and stores them in a list named `L`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers read from the input; for each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}, and 1 <= s_i <= n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `L` is a list of integers read from the input.**
