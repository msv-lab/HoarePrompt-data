t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m_1, and m_2 are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1} are integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}. s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2} are integers such that 1 <= s_i <= n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
