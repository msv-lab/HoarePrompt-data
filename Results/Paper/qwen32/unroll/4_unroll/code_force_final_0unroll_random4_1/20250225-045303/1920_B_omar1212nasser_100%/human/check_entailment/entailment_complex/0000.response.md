### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided functions and see if they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function is responsible for reading multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list of integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a` and calls `func_2` to compute the desired result, which is printed.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case. It sorts the list `a` which is a crucial step for the logic in `func_2`. It then calls `func_2` with the correct parameters and prints the result.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the remaining elements in the array `a` after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by -1.
- **Logic Analysis**:
    - **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This means the smallest elements are at the beginning of the array.
    - **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `s` of all elements in `a` is calculated.
    - **Initial Adjustment for Bob's Moves**: The sum `s2` of the last `negatives` elements (which Bob could potentially multiply by -1) is subtracted twice from `s` to account for Bob's moves. This is because if Bob flips `x` elements, the sum decreases by `2 * (sum of the x largest elements)`.
    - **Iterative Calculation**: For each possible number of removals (from 1 to `removals`), the sum `s` is adjusted by removing the `i-th` largest element. The sum `s2` is also adjusted to account for the new largest elements that Bob could flip.
    - **Result Calculation**: The maximum value of the computed sums is returned.

### Evaluation:
- The algorithm in `func_2` correctly considers the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob. By sorting the array and iteratively adjusting the sums, it ensures that the maximum possible sum is achieved after both players make their moves optimally.
- The logic for calculating the sum after Bob's moves is correct, as it takes into account the largest possible elements that Bob can flip to minimize the sum.
- The iterative approach ensures that all possible outcomes are considered, and the maximum of these outcomes is returned.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
