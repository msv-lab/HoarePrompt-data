### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided functions and their behavior to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

**Function `func_1`:**
- This function handles the input parsing and orchestrates the solution for each test case.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.
- It sorts the array `a` in ascending order and then calls `func_2` to compute the optimal sum after Alice and Bob's moves.
- The result from `func_2` is printed for each test case.

**Function `func_2`:**
- This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice and Bob's moves.
- It starts by calculating the sum of all elements `s`.
- It then calculates the sum of the `x` largest elements in the sorted array `s2`.
- It computes the initial possible sum if Bob flips the `x` largest elements, which is `s - 2 * s2`.
- It iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `k`), updating the sum `s` by subtracting the removed element and adjusting `s2` if the number of flips by Bob changes.
- It keeps track of the maximum possible sum across these iterations.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting the array:** Sorting the array helps in easily identifying the smallest and largest elements.
- **Alice's Move:** By removing the smallest elements, Alice maximizes the sum of the remaining elements.
- **Bob's Move:** By flipping the largest elements, Bob minimizes the sum of the array.
- **Iterative Calculation:** The iterative calculation in `func_2` correctly handles the dynamic adjustment of sums as elements are removed and flipped.

### Correctness:
The functions together correctly simulate the optimal moves by Alice and Bob, and the logic ensures that the maximum possible sum after both players have made their moves is computed.

**Correctness:** **True**
