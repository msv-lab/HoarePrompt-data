Given the initial state, we have the following variables:
- `i`: The index where a loop stopped.
- `j`: The position in list `b` after the last match.
- `k`: The count of matched characters from list `a` in list `b`.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(k)
```

The variable `k` is described as the count of matched characters from list `a` in list `b`. Since the exact lists `a` and `b` are not provided, the exact numerical value of `k` cannot be determined. However, based on the description, `k` represents the number of characters from `a` that have been matched in `b`.

Output: **k (where k is the count of matched characters from list a in list b)**
