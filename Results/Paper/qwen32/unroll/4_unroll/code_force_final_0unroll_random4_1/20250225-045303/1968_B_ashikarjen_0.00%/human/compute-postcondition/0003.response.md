Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b respectively, followed by the binary strings a and b themselves. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the first two integers read from the input. `a` is assigned the value of the first binary string read from the input. `b` is assigned the value of the second binary string read from the input. `k` is 0.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the variable `k` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial values or are still to be assigned based on the input.
