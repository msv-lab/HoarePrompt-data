### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:

- **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
- **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with two others.
- **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other, or with two others.

The goal is to find the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or determine if it's impossible.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, considering extroverts must be in groups of three.
   - **Logic**:
     - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means extroverts can't be perfectly grouped into threes.
     - Check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots to make complete groups of three.
     - If not, return `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate extroverts in groups of three.
     - If possible, calculate the total number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`, which accounts for any leftover universals that might need their own tent.
   
2. **Function `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the total number of tents needed, including tents for introverts.
   - **Logic**:
     - Call `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate extroverts, so return `-1`.
     - Otherwise, add the number of tents for introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1`.

#### Validation Against Test Cases:

Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: `1 2 3`**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
   - Extroverts can't be perfectly grouped into threes (`2 % 3 != 0`), but there are enough universals to fill the remaining spot (`2 % 3 + 3 = 5 >= 3`).
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`.
   - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

2. **Test Case 2: `1 4 1`**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
   - Extroverts can't be perfectly grouped into threes (`4 % 3 != 0`), and there aren't enough universals to fill the remaining spots (`4 % 3 + 1 = 2 < 3`).
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None`.
   - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.

3. **Test Case 3: `1 4 2`**
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2
   - Extroverts can't be perfectly grouped into threes (`4 % 3 != 0`), but there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots (`4 % 3 + 2 = 3 >= 3`).
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = ceil(6 / 3) = 2`.
   - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

The provided functions correctly handle these test cases and the logic aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
