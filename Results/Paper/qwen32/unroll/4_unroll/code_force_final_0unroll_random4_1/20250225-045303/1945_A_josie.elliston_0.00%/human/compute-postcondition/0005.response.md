To determine the output state, let's analyze the given conditions and the code snippet.

Given:
- `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers.
- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is 3 or greater.

The code snippet:
```python
return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
```

Let's consider the cases:
1. If `extroverts` is divisible by 3, the value of `extroverts % 3` is 0. Therefore, the sum `extroverts % 3 + universals` simplifies to `universals`. The expression `(extroverts + universals) / 3` will be a non-negative integer or a decimal. The `ceil` function will round up to the nearest integer.
2. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, `extroverts % 3` is either 1 or 2. According to the condition, `extroverts % 3 + universals` is 3 or greater. This means `universals` is at least `3 - (extroverts % 3)`, which is either 2 or 1. The expression `(extroverts + universals) / 3` will be a non-negative decimal or integer, and `ceil` will round it up to the nearest integer.

In both cases, the `ceil` function will ensure that the result is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

Output State: **The program returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
