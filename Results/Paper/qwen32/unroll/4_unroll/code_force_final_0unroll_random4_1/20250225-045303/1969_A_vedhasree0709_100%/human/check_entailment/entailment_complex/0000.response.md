Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least two friends come to the party based on the given conditions. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements.

The program checks if there exists a pair of friends (i, p_i) such that p_i = i + 1 and, if so, outputs 2. Otherwise, it outputs 3. This approach is flawed because it does not accurately determine the minimum number of invitations needed. It only checks for a specific condition (p_i = i + 1) and does not consider other possible pairs that could satisfy the requirement of having at least two friends come to the party.

For example, in the second test case of the provided example:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program would output 3 because there is no index `i` such that `p_i = i + 1`. However, the correct answer is 3, which can be achieved by inviting friends 1, 2, and 3. The program does not account for this scenario correctly.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible pairs of friends to determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends come to the party.

Correctness: **False**
