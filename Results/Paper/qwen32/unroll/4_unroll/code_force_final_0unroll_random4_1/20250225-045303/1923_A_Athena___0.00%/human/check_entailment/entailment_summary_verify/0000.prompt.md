You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a list of `n` binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it removes leading and trailing 0s from the list, prints the modified list, and then counts and prints the number of 0s remaining in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This is not the correct approach because it changes the relative positions of the chips and the free cells, which affects the number of operations needed.

2. The program simply counts the number of zeros in the modified list `a` and prints this count as the result. This is incorrect because the number of operations required depends on the distance between chips and the closest free cells to their left, not just the number of zeros.

3. The program does not account for the fact that chips can be moved to any free cell to the left, and the goal is to minimize the total number of moves.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- The chip at position 7 can be moved to position 5, resulting in the configuration `0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0`, which requires only 1 move.
- The program, however, would count the number of zeros in the modified list `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]` and output `2`, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the total number of moves required by considering the distance each chip needs to be moved to form a contiguous block. This involves iterating through the list and calculating the cost of moving each chip to the leftmost possible position while maintaining the order of the chips.
