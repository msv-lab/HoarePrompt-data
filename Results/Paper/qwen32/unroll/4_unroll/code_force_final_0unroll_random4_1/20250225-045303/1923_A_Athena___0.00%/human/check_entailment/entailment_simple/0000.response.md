### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of operations required to move chips into a single contiguous block. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the list `a` which contains `n` integers (either 0 or 1).

2. **Initial Preprocessing:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This step is correct since leading and trailing free cells (0s) do not contribute to the number of operations needed to form a contiguous block of chips (1s).

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - After stripping the leading and trailing zeros, the program counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a`. This count represents the number of gaps that need to be filled by moving chips to the left.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of zeros as the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Approach:**
  - The approach of removing leading and trailing zeros is correct because these do not affect the relative positions of the chips within the block.
  - Counting the number of zeros in the remaining list correctly identifies the number of gaps that need to be filled by moving chips to the left.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - The program correctly handles the input constraints and produces the expected output for the provided examples.
  - The program correctly prints the number of operations needed for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to move chips into a single contiguous block. The reasoning and implementation are sound.

### Correctness: **True**
