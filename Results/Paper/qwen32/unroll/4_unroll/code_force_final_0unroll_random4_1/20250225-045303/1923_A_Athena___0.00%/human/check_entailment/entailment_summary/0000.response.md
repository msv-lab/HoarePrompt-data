Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block without any free cells (0s) between them. The program removes leading and trailing 0s and then counts the remaining 0s, which does not equate to the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine how many moves are required to move all chips into a contiguous block. The correct approach is to find the range of indices where the chips (1s) are located and then calculate the number of operations needed to move all chips into this range by moving them to the closest free cell to the left.

For example, in the first test case:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The chips are at positions 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. To form a single block, we need to move the chip at position 6 to position 5 and the chip at position 7 to position 5 or 6. This requires a total of 1 operation.

The provided program does not perform this calculation and instead incorrectly counts the number of 0s between the first and last chip, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of moves required.

Correctness: **False**
