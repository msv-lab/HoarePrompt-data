Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block. Here's why:

1. The program first removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This step is correct as it does not affect the relative positions of the chips.
2. After removing the leading and trailing zeros, the program counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a` and prints this count as the result. However, the number of zeros does not directly correspond to the minimum number of moves required to group the chips.

The correct approach involves calculating the number of moves required to bring all chips together into a contiguous block. This can be done by finding the number of gaps (free cells) between the chips and summing up the distances each chip needs to move to fill these gaps.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Remove leading and trailing zeros
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of moves
        res = 0
        chip_positions = [i for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == 1]
        median_position = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        
        for pos in chip_positions:
            res += abs(pos - median_position)
        
        # Since we are moving chips to the median position, we need to adjust for the fact that
        # the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, but we need to count the actual moves
        # to bring all chips together in a single block.
        # The correct approach is to count the number of gaps between chips and sum them up.
        res = len(chip_positions) - 1 - (chip_positions[-1] - chip_positions[0] + 1 - len(chip_positions))
        
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a single contiguous block by considering the gaps between the chips.
