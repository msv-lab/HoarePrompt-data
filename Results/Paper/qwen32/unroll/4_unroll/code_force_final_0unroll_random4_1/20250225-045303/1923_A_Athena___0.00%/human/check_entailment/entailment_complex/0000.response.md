### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a` (containing 0s and 1s) are read.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`.
   - It then counts the number of zeros remaining in the list `a` and prints this count as the result.

3. **Output:**
   - The output for each test case is the number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

- **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
  - The program correctly removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is necessary because leading and trailing zeros do not contribute to the number of operations needed to move chips into a contiguous block.

- **Counting Remaining Zeros:**
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros, the program counts the number of zeros remaining in the list `a` and prints this count. This count represents the number of operations required to move the chips into a contiguous block.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Number of zeros remaining: `1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
   - Number of zeros remaining: `0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Number of zeros remaining: `0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Number of zeros remaining: `2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Number of zeros remaining: `3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes each test case and outputs the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
