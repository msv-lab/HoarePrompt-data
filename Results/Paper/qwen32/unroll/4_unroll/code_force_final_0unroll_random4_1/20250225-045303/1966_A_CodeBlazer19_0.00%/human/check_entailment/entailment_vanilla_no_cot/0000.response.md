Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The current implementation always outputs `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the described operations.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the frequency of each card number in the hand and calculate how many cards can be reduced by performing the operations. Specifically, for each unique card number, you can reduce the count of cards by `k - 1` for every `k` cards of that number. The final result is the sum of the remaining cards after performing these reductions for all card numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        from collections import Counter
        counter = Counter(l)
        remaining_cards = 0
        for count in counter.values():
            remaining_cards += count % k
        if remaining_cards == 0:
            remaining_cards = k
        print(remaining_cards)

func()
```

This program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card number and then calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder when the count of each card number is divided by `k`. If the total remainder is zero, it means all cards can be grouped into sets of `k` and replaced, leaving `k - 1` cards, but since no cards are left in this case, we set it to `k` to ensure the output is at least 1.
