Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program contains a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Global Variables**: The `dfs` function uses global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. This can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or if the global state is not properly initialized or reset. In a more robust implementation, these variables should be passed as arguments to the function or managed within the scope of `func_1`.

2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS (Depth-First Search) logic in the `dfs` function is intended to determine if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. However, the logic does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically:
   - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. This is correct.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to track the sum of radii, but the logic for updating them and checking if the sum can be decreased is flawed. The logic does not ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.

3. **Output Logic**: The program prints "YES" if `c1 != 0` for any connected component of disks. This logic is not sufficient to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. The program should ensure that the total sum of radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency, which is not guaranteed by the current logic.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
In this case, the disks are arranged in a line and are tangent to each other. The program should output "NO" because there is no way to adjust the radii such that the sum of radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. However, the provided program will output "YES" because `c1` will not be zero for the connected component of disks.

### Correctness: **False**
