Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `y` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `r` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `False`; `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `None`; `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `None`; `nodes` is an empty list; `ok` is `False`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `ok` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
