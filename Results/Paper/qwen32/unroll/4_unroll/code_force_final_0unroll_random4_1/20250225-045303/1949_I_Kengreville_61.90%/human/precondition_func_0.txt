n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of length n, where each element of x and y is an integer such that -10^9 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^9, and each element of r is an integer such that 1 <= r_i <= 10^9. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized with None. nodes is an initially empty list.
