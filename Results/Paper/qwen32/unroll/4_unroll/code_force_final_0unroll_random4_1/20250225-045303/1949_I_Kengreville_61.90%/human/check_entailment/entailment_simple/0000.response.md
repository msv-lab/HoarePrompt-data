### Reasoning:

The provided Python program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and reducing the sum of the radii. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - It initializes `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists to keep track of visited disks and coefficients for the linear combination of radii.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - For each unvisited disk, it starts a DFS traversal.
   - During the traversal, it checks if two disks are tangent (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii).
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for the second disk based on the first disk.
   - The DFS continues to explore all tangent disks.

3. **Coefficient Sum Check**:
   - After each DFS traversal, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the current connected component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, it means there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.

4. **Decision**:
   - If any DFS traversal results in a non-zero sum of `coef1`, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic relies on the fact that if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, it indicates a possibility to adjust the radii in such a way that the sum of the radii decreases.
- The DFS ensures that all tangent disks are considered in each connected component.
- The mathematical approach (using coefficients) is designed to check the feasibility of the radius adjustments.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted according to the problem requirements. Given the provided examples and the described approach, the program seems to be correct.
