Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes three lists `x`, `y`, and `r`, each of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 1000`), with `x` and `y` containing integers within the range `-10^9` to `10^9`, and `r` containing integers within the range `1` to `10^9`. Additionally, it uses three lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1`, each of length `n` and initially set to `None`. It also uses a list `nodes` that is initially empty. The function returns the list `nodes` after processing the input lists.**
