The code snippet `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. This means that the value of `b` will now be whatever `func_1(d)` returns. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, and `previous`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the 0-based indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs(a)` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex as computed by the `bfs(a)` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
