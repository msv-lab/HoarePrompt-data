The code snippet provided is:
```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentioned that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer value is input by the user. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is an adjacency list of the tree, which is not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains the indices of vertices adjacent to the vertex at the respective index in `u2vs`, representing the adjacency list of an undirected tree; `n` is the integer input by the user representing the number of vertices in the tree, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^3.**
