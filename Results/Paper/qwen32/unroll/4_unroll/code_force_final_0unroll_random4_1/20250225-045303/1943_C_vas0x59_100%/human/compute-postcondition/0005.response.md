To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(d)` does. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we can only assume that it takes the list `d` as input and returns some value or modifies it in some way. 

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can only state that `a` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. The values of `u2vs` and `d` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies `d` in place, which is not indicated.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the 0-based indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
