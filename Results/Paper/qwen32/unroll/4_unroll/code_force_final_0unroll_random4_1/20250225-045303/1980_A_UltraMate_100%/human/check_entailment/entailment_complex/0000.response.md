### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

2. **Counting Problems**:
   - It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Additions**:
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' (stored in the string `p`).
   - For each difficulty level `i` in `p`:
     - If `i` is not present in the `hmp` (the count of problems), it means there are no problems of this difficulty level, so it needs `m` more problems of this difficulty level.
     - If `i` is present in `hmp` but the count of `i` is less than `m`, it needs `m - hmp[i]` more problems of this difficulty level.
   - It adds the required number of problems to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`
   - Count of each difficulty level: `B=2`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=1`, `D=2`
   - Required for each difficulty level: `A=1`, `B=1`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=1`, `G=1`
   - Additional problems needed: `A=1`, `C=0`, `F=1` (since `B`, `D`, `E`, `G` already meet the requirement)
   - Total additional problems: `1 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`
   - Count of each difficulty level: `B=2`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=1`, `D=2`
   - Required for each difficulty level: `A=2`, `B=2`, `C=2`, `D=2`, `E=2`, `F=2`, `G=2`
   - Additional problems needed: `A=2`, `C=1`, `F=2` (since `B`, `D`, `E`, `G` already meet the requirement)
   - Total additional problems: `2 + 1 + 2 = 5`
   - Output: `5`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
   - Count of each difficulty level: `B=2`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=2`, `G=2`
   - Required for each difficulty level: `A=1`, `B=1`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=1`, `G=1`
   - Additional problems needed: `A=1` (since `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G` already meet the requirement)
   - Total additional problems: `1`
   - Output: `1`

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
