To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid and Diagonals**:
   - We have an `n x n` grid.
   - The total number of diagonals in the grid is `4n - 2`. This includes both main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left) and all the diagonals parallel to them.

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For `k <= 2n`, we can strategically place cells in such a way that we minimize the number of cells needed. The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` works because we can cover `k` diagonals by coloring `ceil(k / 2)` cells due to the overlapping nature of diagonals.
   - For `k > 2n`, we need to cover more diagonals, and the formula `k // 2 + 1` helps in determining the minimum number of cells needed. This accounts for the fact that we can cover more diagonals by placing cells in overlapping positions.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the given program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the grid) and `k` (minimum number of diagonals).

2. **Handling Special Case**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because we only need to color one cell to cover one diagonal.

3. **Handling `k <= 2n`**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2n`, the program outputs `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because we can cover `k` diagonals by coloring `ceil(k / 2)` cells, given the overlapping nature of diagonals.

4. **Handling `k > 2n`**:
   - If `k` is greater than `2n`, the program outputs `k // 2 + 1`. This formula accounts for the fact that we need to cover more diagonals and the additional cells required due to the increased number of diagonals.

### Function Summary Validation

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program:
- For `k == 1`, it prints `1`.
- For `k <= 2 * n`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- For `k > 2 * n`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover at least `k` diagonals. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both small and large values of `k`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
