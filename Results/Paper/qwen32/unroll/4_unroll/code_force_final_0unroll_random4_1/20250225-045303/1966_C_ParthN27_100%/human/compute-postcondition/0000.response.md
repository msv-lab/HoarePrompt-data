In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range specified by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable is `_` (an underscore), which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. 

Given that, the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `_`. However, since `_` is just a placeholder and does not influence the loop execution condition, the state of `_` does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Thus, the state we need to ensure is that `t` (the number of test cases) is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`n` and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are defined within the loop body and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
