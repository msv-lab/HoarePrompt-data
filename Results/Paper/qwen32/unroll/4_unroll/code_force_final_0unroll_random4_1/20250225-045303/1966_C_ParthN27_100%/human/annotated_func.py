#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed for each test case, indicating the winner of each game.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game based on the distribution of stones and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' as the winner.
