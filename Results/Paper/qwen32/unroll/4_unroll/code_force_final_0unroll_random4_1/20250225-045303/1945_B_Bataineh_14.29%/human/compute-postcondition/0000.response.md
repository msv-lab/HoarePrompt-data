The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will be assigned the value of the integer input, which may or may not be the same as the initial value of `t` as per the precondition. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged and still hold their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b`, `m` <= 10^18.**
