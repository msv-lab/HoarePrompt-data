Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals` and `negatives`, which are non-negative integers, and `elements`, which is a list of integers. If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a list of values based on the sum of the elements and their sublists, and returns the maximum value from this list.**
