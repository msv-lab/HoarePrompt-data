The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It then calculates and prints a product value based on these inputs using the function `func_2`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has printed the product for each test case.
