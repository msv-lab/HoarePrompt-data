t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15) representing the number of ships and the number of attacks, respectively, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the durability of each ship. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
