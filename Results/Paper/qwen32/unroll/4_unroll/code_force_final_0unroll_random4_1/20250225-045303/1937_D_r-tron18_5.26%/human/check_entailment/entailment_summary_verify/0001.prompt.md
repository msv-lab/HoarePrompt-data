You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and computes a list of values based on the sequence of characters in `s1`. It prints this list as output. The string `s1` remains unchanged after the function execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it accurately implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's go through the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Movement Rules**:
   - If the pinball is on a cell with '<', it moves left.
   - If the pinball is on a cell with '>', it moves right.
   - After moving, the character on the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Multiple Queries**:
   - For each query (each cell in the grid), we need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the number of seconds for each cell.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(arr, times):
    l = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
```
- This function seems to be calculating a difference between elements of an array `arr` based on the parameter `times`. However, `n` is not defined within this function, which leads to an error unless `n` is a global variable. This function is used to compute indices for array slicing and differences.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        if el == '>':
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
    print(*ans)
```
- This function processes each test case by iterating over the grid from right to left.
- It maintains prefixes and suffixes of positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
- It calculates the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters and their accumulated sums.
- The function prints the results for each cell in the grid.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Global Variable `n`**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `n` which is not defined within its scope. This would lead to a `NameError` unless `n` is a global variable.

2. **Logic for Calculating Steps**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of steps is complex and involves intricate calculations using accumulated sums. While the approach seems mathematically sound, it is not straightforward to verify without a detailed understanding of the mathematical model behind it.
   - The provided example outputs match the expected results, which suggests the logic might be correct. However, the complexity and the reliance on `n` being a global variable indicate potential issues.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the logic and the reliance on `n` being a global variable, the program is likely incorrect as it stands. The global variable usage is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.
