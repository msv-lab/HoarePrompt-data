Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the pinball movement as described in the problem statement. The algorithm seems to be overly complex and does not account for the basic movement rules and character inversion correctly for all cases. 

Let's break down the issues with the provided code:

1. **Character Inversion**: The code does not correctly implement the inversion of the character after a pinball moves. The problem description specifies that the character should be inverted after the pinball moves, but the code does not reflect this logic.

2. **Movement Logic**: The movement logic in the code is not straightforward and does not match the simple rules provided in the problem description. The pinball should move left or right based on the character, and then the character should be inverted. The code uses complex accumulations and indexing which do not reflect this simple logic.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as a single character grid or grids where all characters are the same ('<' or '>') correctly. For example, if the grid is '<<<<<', the pinball should move left and leave the grid immediately, but the code does not handle this correctly.

4. **Output Format**: The code does not match the expected output format. The problem requires the output for each query to be on a new line, but the code prints all results in a single line separated by spaces.

To verify, let's consider a simple test case:

Input:
```
1
3
>>>
```
Expected Output:
```
1 2 3
```

The provided code does not produce this output correctly. Instead, it would likely produce an incorrect result due to the complex logic and lack of character inversion handling.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
