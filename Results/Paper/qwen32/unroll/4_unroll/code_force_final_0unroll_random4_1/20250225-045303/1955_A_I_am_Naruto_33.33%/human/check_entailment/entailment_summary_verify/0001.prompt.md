You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the given criteria. The cost is determined by either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, whichever is smaller, unless `n` is 1, in which case the cost is simply `a`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated minimum cost for each one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts when there are two pricing options:
1. Buying one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buying two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts).

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - `ans1` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
     - `ans2` calculates the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs whenever possible, and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought individually:
       - `b * (n // 2)` calculates the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts.
       - `a * (n % 2)` calculates the cost for the remaining yogurt, if `n` is odd.
     - The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n` is 1:
     - The program simply prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `min(10, 9) = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
   - Minimum cost: `min(15, 23) = 15`
   - However, the optimal way is to buy 2 yogurts for 9 burles and 1 yogurt for 5 burles, which is `9 + 5 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
   - Minimum cost: `min(15, 27) = 15`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `min(20, 22) = 20`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
