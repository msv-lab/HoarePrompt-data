Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts when there are two pricing options:
1. Buying one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buying two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts).

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - `ans1` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
     - `ans2` calculates the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs whenever possible, and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought individually:
       - `b * (n // 2)` calculates the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts.
       - `a * (n % 2)` calculates the cost for the remaining yogurt, if `n` is odd.
     - The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n` is 1:
     - The program simply prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `min(10, 9) = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
   - Minimum cost: `min(15, 23) = 15`
   - However, the optimal way is to buy 2 yogurts for 9 burles and 1 yogurt for 5 burles, which is `9 + 5 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
   - Minimum cost: `min(15, 27) = 15`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `min(20, 22) = 20`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
