### Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a` because there's no benefit from the promotion.
3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible at the promotional price and the remaining (if any) at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum of the two calculated costs for each test case.

The logic for calculating `ans2` is correct because:
- `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotional price.
- `n % 2` gives the number of remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.

The program correctly handles both the single yogurt case and the multiple yogurts case, and it correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case.
