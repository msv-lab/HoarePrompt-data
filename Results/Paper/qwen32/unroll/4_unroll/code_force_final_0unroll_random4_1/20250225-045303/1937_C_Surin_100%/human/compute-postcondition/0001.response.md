The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input and converts it into an integer. This lambda function does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, or `p` directly. The function `R` is defined but not called in the given code snippet, so no input is read, and no variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `p` is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n-1 for each test case, `R` is a lambda function that reads and converts a line of input into a list of integers.**
