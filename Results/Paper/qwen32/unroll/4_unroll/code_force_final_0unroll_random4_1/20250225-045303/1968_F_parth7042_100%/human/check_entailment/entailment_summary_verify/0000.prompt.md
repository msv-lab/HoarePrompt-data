You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

import sys
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

input = sys.stdin.read
func_1()

def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        q = int(data[index + 1])

            a[i] = int(data[index])

            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)

            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within a specified range whose XOR is 0, and returns 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine whether a subarray is "interesting" based on the XOR of its segments. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
   - This allows the program to compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` efficiently as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

2. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, the program computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is 0, it means the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR 0, and the answer is "YES".
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is not 0, the program checks if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This indicates that the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR, and further splits can be made recursively to ensure all parts have the same XOR.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of prefix XOR and binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the program can handle the large input constraints efficiently.
   - The program processes each test case and its queries in linear time relative to the number of elements and queries, respectively.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the subarray is already a single element (which is trivially interesting if the element is 0).
   - It also handles cases where the subarray can be split into multiple parts with the same XOR.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases. Thus, the correctness of the program is **True**.
