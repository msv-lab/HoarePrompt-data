Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without parameters in the given code snippet. However, based on the context, it processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it handles an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`, and the function returns the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) for each query.**
