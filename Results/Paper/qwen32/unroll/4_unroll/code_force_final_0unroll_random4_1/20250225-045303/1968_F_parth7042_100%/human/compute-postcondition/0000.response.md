The code snippet provided reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This list is then assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `q`, and the array `a` along with the queries are defined, but these are not directly affected by the given code snippet. The only change is the creation of the `data` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
