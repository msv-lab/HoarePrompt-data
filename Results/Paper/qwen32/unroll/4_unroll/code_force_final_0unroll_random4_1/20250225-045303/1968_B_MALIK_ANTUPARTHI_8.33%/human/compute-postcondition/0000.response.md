The code snippet provided is `a = int(input())`. This line of code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` was a binary string of length `n`. After this operation, `a` is no longer a binary string but an integer.

Here is the updated output state:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5. a is an integer. b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
