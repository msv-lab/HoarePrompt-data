### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve optimally removes numbers from the sequence. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero.

### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, and XOR of 2 and 3 is 1, and XOR of 1 and 2 is 3. XOR of 4 with any number (1, 2, or 3) does not result in 0.
   - XOR of 4 with itself is 0.

2. **Winning Condition for Bob**:
   - Bob wins when the XOR of the sequence is 0. This can happen if:
     - All numbers are pairs (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.).
     - The remaining numbers are exactly one 1, one 2, and one 3 (since 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0).
     - Any number of 4s (since XOR of any number of 4s is 0).

### Strategy for Eve:
- Eve should aim to leave sequences that are either all in pairs or exactly one 1, one 2, and one 3.

### Calculation:
- For each number `p_i` (count of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s):
  - `p_i // 2` gives the number of pairs that can be formed.
  - `p_i % 2` gives the remainder after forming pairs.
- The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is exactly one of each of 1, 2, and 3 remaining (which would make the XOR 0).

### Final Calculation:
- The result for each test case is the sum of `p_i // 2` for all `p_i` (total pairs) plus 1 if there is exactly one of each of 1, 2, and 3 remaining.

### Verification:
The provided program correctly calculates the number of pairs and checks for the specific condition where one of each of 1, 2, and 3 remain. This matches the strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

Correctness: **True**
