You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on these counts. The result is the sum of half the counts of each number (rounded down) plus one if the sum of the remainders when each count is divided by two equals three.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and see if it aligns with the problem requirements. The goal is to find the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by optimally choosing which numbers to remove.

### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.

2. **Properties of XOR**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

3. **Numbers in the Sequence**:
   - Numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - XOR of 1 and 3 is 2.
   - XOR of 2 and 4 is 6 (which is 2 in binary, but since we are only dealing with numbers up to 4, this effectively means 2 XOR 4 is 0 in our context).
   - XOR of 1 and 2 is 3.
   - XOR of 1 and 4 is 5 (which is 1 in binary, but since we are only dealing with numbers up to 4, this effectively means 1 XOR 4 is 1 in our context).
   - XOR of 3 and 4 is 7 (which is 3 in binary, but since we are only dealing with numbers up to 4, this effectively means 3 XOR 4 is 3 in our context).

4. **Strategy for Bob to Win**:
   - Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - To achieve this, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers can be paired up to produce XORs that cancel each other out.

### Analysis of the Program

The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`.

- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs of each type of number that can be removed, ensuring that the remaining numbers are either single numbers or can be paired to cancel each other out.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is exactly one of each type of number left after pairing, which would result in a XOR of zero (since 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 is 0).

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12`
   - Output: `12` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
