You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of constraints on a value `k`. For each test case, it calculates and returns the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints. If no such integers exist, it returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x). Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of valid integers k by not properly considering the exclusion of values that are both within the range defined by constraints of type 1 and 2 and also excluded by constraints of type 3.

Here's a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 4
3 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- k must be greater than or equal to 3 (constraint 1).
- k must be less than or equal to 10 (constraint 2).
- k must be not equal to 4 (constraint 3).
- k must be not equal to 7 (constraint 4).

The valid values for k are: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. So the answer is 6.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The program incorrectly counts the number of valid integers k. Here's the breakdown of the program's logic:
- It sets `bx` to the maximum value of constraints of type 1 (which is 3).
- It sets `ax` to the minimum value of constraints of type 2 (which is 10).
- It adds all values of constraints of type 3 to a set `cx` (which contains {4, 7}).
- It then calculates the number of valid k values as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

In this case, `tmp` is 2 (since both 4 and 7 are within the range [3, 10]). So the program calculates the number of valid k values as `10 - 3 + 1 - 2 = 6`, but it incorrectly outputs 5.

The issue arises because the program does not correctly account for the exclusion of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`. The problem is in the logic that calculates `tmp` and how it is subtracted from the total range.

To fix this, the program should correctly count the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx`. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
