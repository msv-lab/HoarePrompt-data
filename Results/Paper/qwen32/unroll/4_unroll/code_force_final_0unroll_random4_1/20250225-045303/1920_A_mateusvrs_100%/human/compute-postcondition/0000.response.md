The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables and their constraints remain unchanged as they are introduced and defined in subsequent lines of code that are not provided in the snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases read from the input, which is an integer between 1 and the number of test cases provided; the other variables and constraints remain as initially described.**
