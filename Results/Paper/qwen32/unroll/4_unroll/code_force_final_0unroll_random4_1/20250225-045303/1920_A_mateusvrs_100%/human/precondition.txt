t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each of the following n lines contains two integers a and x, where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. a = 1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a = 2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a = 3 means k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
