### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - It then initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints, `n`.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to keep track of values that \( k \) must not be equal to.
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000007) and `bx` to -1. These variables will be used to store the maximum value for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x) and the minimum value for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), respectively.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - After reading all constraints, the program checks if `bx` (the maximum lower bound) is greater than `ax` (the minimum upper bound). If this is the case, it means there are no possible values for \( k \) that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) by subtracting the number of excluded values (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all types of constraints and ensures that the final count of valid integers \( k \) is accurate. It efficiently processes each test case and provides the correct output based on the given constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
