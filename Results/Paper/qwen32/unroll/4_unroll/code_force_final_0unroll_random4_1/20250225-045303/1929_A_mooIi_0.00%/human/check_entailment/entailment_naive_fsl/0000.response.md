Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array elements. The task requires rearranging the array to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. A common strategy is to sort the array and then interleave the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences.

Here's an example where the provided program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

**Expected Output:**
```
57
```

**Actual Output:**
```
43 54 80 90 100
```

The program sorts the array and prints it, but it does not compute the maximum beauty. The correct approach would involve rearranging the array to maximize the sum of differences, which can be achieved by sorting and then interleaving the smallest and largest elements.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
