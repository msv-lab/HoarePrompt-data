### Reasoning:
The program aims to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube, which is at index `f` (1-based), will be removed when the cubes are sorted in non-increasing order and the first `k` cubes are removed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, and adjusts `f` and `k` to be 0-based indices by subtracting 1.
   - It then reads the list `a` of `n` integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored.
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.
   - The program then compares the `k`-th largest value in the sorted list (`a[k]`) with the value of the favorite cube (`x`):
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is definitely not removed (since `a[k]` is one of the `k` largest values, and `x` is not among the `k` largest).
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is definitely removed (since `x` is greater than the `k`-th largest value, it must be among the first `k` values after sorting).
     - If `a[k] == x`, the decision depends on whether `x` is the last element in the sorted list or if the next element in the sorted list is less than `x`. If `x` is not the last element and the next element is less than `x`, it means `x` could be the `k`-th largest or not, resulting in "MAYBE".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is equal to `n-1`, it means all cubes except the last one are removed. In this case, the favorite cube will not be removed if it is the last element in the sorted list.
   - If `a[k] == x` and `a[k+1] < x`, it means `x` could be the `k`-th largest or not, leading to "MAYBE".

The program correctly handles these cases and provides the correct output based on the described logic.
