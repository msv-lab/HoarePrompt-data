Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a` of cube values.

2. **Adjusting Indices**: Since Python lists are zero-indexed, the program subtracts 1 from `f` and `k` to correctly reference the favorite cube and the threshold index after sorting.

3. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Comparison Logic**:
   - If the value of the cube at the `k`-th position after sorting (`a[k]`) is greater than the value of the favorite cube (`x`), it means the favorite cube will not be removed in any case, so the program prints "NO".
   - If the value of the cube at the `k`-th position is less than the value of the favorite cube, it means the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, so the program prints "YES".
   - If the value of the cube at the `k`-th position is equal to the value of the favorite cube, the program checks if `k` is the last index (`k == n - 1`) or if the next cube (`a[k + 1]`) has a smaller value. If either condition is true, the favorite cube will not be removed, so the program prints "NO". Otherwise, the favorite cube may be either removed or left, so the program prints "MAYBE".

5. **Output**: The program outputs the correct result for each test case based on the above logic.

Given the problem description and the provided execution states, the program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
