t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, an integer k such that 2 <= k <= 100, and a list of n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n where each c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 100. The length of test_cases is equal to t.
