### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to find the maximum length of a prefix of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, and the strings themselves.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0. `i` is used to traverse string `a`, and `j` is used to traverse string `b`.
   - A counter `c` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `b` and `i` is less than the length of `a`.
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1` is called with the current indices `i` and `j`.
   - `func_1` searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`. If found, it returns the index of `a[i]` in `b` starting from `j`; otherwise, it returns -1.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), it means `a[i]` is found in `b` starting from `j`. The index `j` is updated to `new_j + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 (to move to the next character in `a`), and `c` is incremented by 1 (to count the matched character).
   - If `func_1` returns -1, it means `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from `j`, and the loop breaks.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the value of `c` is printed, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification:

- The function `func_1` correctly finds the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]` and returns the correct index or -1 if not found.
- The main logic iterates through `a` and `b` correctly and updates the pointers and counter as expected.
- The program handles edge cases, such as when `a` or `b` is empty or when no characters match.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of a prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.
