To determine the output state, we need to consider the loop's behavior and how the variables `x` and `y` are modified during each iteration. The loop runs 10 times, and in each iteration, it reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts to integers, and appends them to the lists `x` and `y`, respectively.

Given that the problem does not specify the exact input values, we can describe the output state in a general form. After 10 iterations, the list `x` will contain 10 integers, and the list `y` will also contain 10 integers, each corresponding to the values read from the input during each iteration.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers.**
