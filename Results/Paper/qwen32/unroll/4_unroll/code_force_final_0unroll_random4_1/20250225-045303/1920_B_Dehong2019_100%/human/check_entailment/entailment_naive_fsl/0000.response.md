Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Let's break down why the code is incorrect by examining the logic and a specific test case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Alice's Strategy**: The code does not correctly handle the optimal removal of elements by Alice. It simply removes the largest elements in the sorted array without considering the impact on Bob's subsequent moves.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: The code does not correctly handle the optimal flipping of elements by Bob. It assumes that flipping the largest remaining elements is always optimal, which may not be the case.

### Specific Test Case:
Let's consider a test case where the code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-15
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Alice can remove up to 2 elements. Removing the two largest elements (which are -1 and -2) leaves the array as `[-3, -4, -5]`.
- Bob can flip up to 2 elements. Flipping the two largest elements (which are -3 and -4) results in the array `[3, 4, -5]`.
- The sum of the array is `3 + 4 - 5 = 2`.

However, the optimal strategy is:
- Alice should remove the two smallest elements (which are -4 and -5) leaving the array as `[-1, -2, -3]`.
- Bob should flip the two smallest elements (which are -1 and -2) resulting in the array `[1, 2, -3]`.
- The sum of the array is `1 + 2 - 3 = 0`.

But the code will not achieve this optimal strategy.

### Code Behavior with the Test Case:
- The code will sort the array in descending order: `[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]`.
- It will then remove the two largest elements (which are -1 and -2) leaving the array as `[-3, -4, -5]`.
- It will then flip the two largest elements (which are -3 and -4) resulting in the array `[3, 4, -5]`.
- The sum of the array is `3 + 4 - 5 = 2`.

However, the code does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players, as seen in the above example.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
