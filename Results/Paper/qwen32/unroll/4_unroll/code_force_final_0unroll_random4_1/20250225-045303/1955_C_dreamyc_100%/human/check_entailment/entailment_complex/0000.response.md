Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine the number of ships that are sunk by the Kraken after `k` attacks. The logic in the function `func_1` needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure it correctly reflects the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Early Exit Condition**: If `k` (the number of attacks) is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities (`sum(nums)`), all ships will be sunk. This is correctly handled by the first `if` statement in `func_1` which returns `n` (the number of ships) in this case.

2. **Attack Distribution**: The Kraken alternates attacks between the first and last remaining ships. This means the first `math.ceil(k / 2)` attacks will be on the first ship in the sequence, and the remaining `k // 2` attacks will be on the last ship in the sequence.

3. **Cumulative Durability Calculation**: The program calculates cumulative durability from both ends of the list (`s_a` from the start, `s_b` from the end). It then checks if the cumulative sum of durability from each end is less than or equal to the respective attack counts (`a` and `b`). However, the logic here is flawed. The program increments `ans` each time the cumulative sum from either end is less than or equal to the respective attack counts, but this doesn't correctly count the number of ships that are sunk.

4. **Flaw in Counting Sunk Ships**: The current logic does not correctly simulate the sinking of ships. It does not account for the fact that once a ship's durability reaches 0, it is no longer counted in subsequent attacks. The logic should simulate the attacks in sequence, reducing the durability of the first and last ships alternately until they sink, and then removing them from consideration.

Given these points, the program does not correctly simulate the sequence of attacks and the sinking of ships. Therefore, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
