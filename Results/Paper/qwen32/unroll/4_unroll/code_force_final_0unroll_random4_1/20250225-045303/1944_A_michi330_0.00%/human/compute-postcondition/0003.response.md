Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, `n` represents the number of elements (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` represents a value between 0 and the maximum possible number of edges in a simple undirected graph with `n` vertices (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2). The function returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.**
