### Reasoning:
The given program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The approach taken by the program is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes variables to keep track of the current number being counted (`num`), the count of consecutive occurrences of that number (`same`), and the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number (`minn`).

2. **Iteration**: It iterates through the array, updating the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number. When it encounters a different number, it compares the current count with `minn` and updates `minn` if the current count is smaller. It then resets the count for the new number.

3. **Final Check**: After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` in case the array ends with a sequence of the last number.

4. **Decision**: If `minn` is still `inf` or if `minn` equals the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), it outputs `-1` (indicating that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements). Otherwise, it outputs `minn` as the minimum number of elements to remove.

The logic seems correct based on the problem description. The key idea is that if the smallest group of consecutive identical elements can be removed, the array will no longer be beautiful. The program correctly identifies the smallest group of consecutive elements and decides whether the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements from this group.

### Correctness: **True**
