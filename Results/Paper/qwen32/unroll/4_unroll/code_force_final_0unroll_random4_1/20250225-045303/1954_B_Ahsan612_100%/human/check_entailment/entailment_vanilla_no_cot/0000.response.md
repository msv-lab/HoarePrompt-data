Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program does not account for the correct conditions under which the array can cease to be beautiful after removing elements.

Here's a brief analysis of the issues:

1. The program calculates the length of the longest contiguous segment of identical elements (`same`) and then finds the smallest such segment (`minn`). However, this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

2. The program outputs `-1` if `minn` is `inf` or equal to the length of the array. While this is correct for the case where all elements are the same (since it cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements), it is not sufficient for other cases.

3. For an array to stop being beautiful, we need to consider the structure of the array and the positions of elements that can be changed through the given operation. Simply finding the smallest segment of identical elements does not provide the correct answer.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to analyze the structure of the array and determine the minimum number of removals required to disrupt the "beauty" condition. This involves checking the positions of elements and ensuring that the array cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations after the removals.
