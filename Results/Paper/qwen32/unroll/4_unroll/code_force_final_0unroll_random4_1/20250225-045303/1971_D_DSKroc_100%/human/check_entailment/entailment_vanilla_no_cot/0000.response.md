Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The task is to determine the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The provided program uses the following logic:
1. It iterates through the string and counts the number of times the character changes from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'.
2. If there are no '0's followed by '1's in the string (i.e., the string is already sorted or all characters are the same), it adds 1 to the count.
3. Otherwise, it prints the count of changes.

Let's check this logic with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Changes: `1->0`, `0->1`
   - Count: 2
   - Since there is a '0' followed by a '1', the final count remains 2.
   - **Expected Output:** 3 (The correct output is 3, not 2. The program is incorrect here.)

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - Changes: 0 (no changes)
   - Count: 0
   - Since there are no '0's followed by '1's, the final count is 0 + 1 = 1.
   - **Expected Output:** 1 (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1`
   - Changes: 0 (no changes)
   - Count: 0
   - Since there are no '0's followed by '1's, the final count is 0 + 1 = 1.
   - **Expected Output:** 1 (Correct)

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Changes: `1->0`
   - Count: 1
   - Since there is a '0' followed by a '1', the final count remains 1.
   - **Expected Output:** 2 (The correct output is 2, not 1. The program is incorrect here.)

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - Changes: `0->1`
   - Count: 1
   - Since there is a '0' followed by a '1', the final count remains 1.
   - **Expected Output:** 1 (Correct)

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Changes: `0->1`, `1->0`
   - Count: 2
   - Since there is a '0' followed by a '1', the final count remains 2.
   - **Expected Output:** 2 (Correct)

From the above analysis, it's clear that the program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails when the string can be split into more than one piece but is not already sorted in a way that requires more than one piece to be rearranged into a sorted string.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**
