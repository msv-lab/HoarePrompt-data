You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a single binary string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        s = input()

    #State: a series of numbers, each representing the result of processing one test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case, and outputs the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in each string. If the string is non-decreasing (i.e., it does not have a '0' followed by a '1'), it adds one to the count of transitions before outputting the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- You are given a binary string.
- You need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut the string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
- A sorted binary string is one where all '0's come before all '1's.
- Each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces.
- The pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string.
- You must use all the pieces in the rearrangement.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' and from '0' to '1' in the string. It uses this count to determine the minimum number of pieces required.

Here is the program for reference:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
```

### Key Logic:
- The `count` variable counts the number of times the character changes from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'.
- The `flag` variable is set to `1` if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.
- If `flag` is `0` (i.e., there are no '0's followed by '1's), it means the string is already sorted, and the program prints `count + 1`. However, this seems incorrect because if the string is already sorted, it should print `1` (not `count + 1`).
- If `flag` is `1`, it means there are transitions, and the program prints `count`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's analyze the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1 -> 0`, `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 0` (count = 3)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - Transitions: None (count = 0)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1`
   - Transitions: None (count = 0)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transitions: `1 -> 0` (count = 1)
   - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - Transitions: None (count = 0)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions: `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 0` (count = 2)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the input `10` because it should output `2` (since the string needs to be cut into two pieces to sort it), but the program outputs `1`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly handles the case where the string has a single transition from '1' to '0'. It should always output `count + 1` for any non-empty string, as each transition indicates the need for an additional piece. The condition `if flag == 0` is unnecessary and incorrect for determining the number of pieces needed.
