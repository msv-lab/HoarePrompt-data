Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500); for each test case, there is a single binary string `s` (1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The precondition about the binary strings `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the provided code snippet.
