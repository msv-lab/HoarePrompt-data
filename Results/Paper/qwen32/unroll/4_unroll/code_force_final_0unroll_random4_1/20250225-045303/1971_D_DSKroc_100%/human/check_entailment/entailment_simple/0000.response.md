### Reasoning:

To determine the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string, we need to identify the points in the string where a transition from '1' to '0' or '0' to '1' occurs. Each transition indicates a potential cut point. However, the critical observation is that if the string starts with '1' and ends with '0', we need an additional piece to ensure that all '0's can be moved to the front. This is because the initial segment starting with '1' cannot be combined with any subsequent segment starting with '0' without violating the sorted order.

The provided code correctly identifies these transition points and counts them. It also checks if there is at least one '0' following a '1' (indicated by the `flag` variable). If such a transition exists, the number of cuts is exactly the number of transitions (`count`). If there are no such transitions (meaning the string is already sorted or consists of only one type of character), the number of pieces needed is `count + 1`.

Let's break down the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **Input: `11010`**
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0` (3 transitions)
   - Output: `3`

2. **Input: `00000000`**
   - Transitions: None
   - Output: `1` (since `flag` is `0`, indicating no '0' after a '1', thus `count + 1`)

3. **Input: `1`**
   - Transitions: None
   - Output: `1` (since `flag` is `0`, indicating no '0' after a '1', thus `count + 1`)

4. **Input: `10`**
   - Transitions: `1->0` (1 transition)
   - Output: `2` (since `flag` is `1`, indicating a '0' after a '1', thus `count`)

5. **Input: `0001111`**
   - Transitions: `0->1` (1 transition)
   - Output: `1` (since `flag` is `1`, indicating a '0' after a '1', thus `count`)

6. **Input: `0110`**
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0` (2 transitions)
   - Output: `2` (since `flag` is `1`, indicating a '0' after a '1', thus `count`)

The provided code correctly handles all these cases, and the logic aligns with the problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
