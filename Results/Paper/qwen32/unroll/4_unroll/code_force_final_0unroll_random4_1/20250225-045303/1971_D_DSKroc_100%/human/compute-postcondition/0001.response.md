The only variables in the loop head are `q` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500). This value already ensures that the loop will execute if it is within the given range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. The variable `q` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500), `q` is the loop variable**
