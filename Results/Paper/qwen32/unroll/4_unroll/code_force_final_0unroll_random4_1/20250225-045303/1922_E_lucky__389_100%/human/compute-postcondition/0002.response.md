Output State: **The input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer `X` (2 ≤ `X` ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences that the array should have. `x` is an input integer. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `mx` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
