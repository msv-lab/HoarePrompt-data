### Reasoning:

To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, we need to analyze the constraints and the logic in the provided program.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts with the same color.
   - The goal is to prevent Bob from making all `n` parts the same color.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. Hence, the answer is **NO**.
   - If `n > k`, we need to see if Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color can dominate even after Bob repainting `k` parts.
   - The critical insight is that if Alice can ensure that the most frequent color appears less than `n - k` times, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - If Alice uses `m` colors, the most frequent color can appear at most `math.ceil(n / m)` times (using the pigeonhole principle).
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that Bob can repaint enough parts of the most frequent color to make all parts the same color, so the answer is **NO**.
   - Otherwise, Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal, so the answer is **YES**.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly checks the conditions `n <= k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints **NO**.
   - Otherwise, it prints **YES**.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

**Correctness: True**
