The code snippet initializes a list `b` with 26 elements, all set to 0. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**
