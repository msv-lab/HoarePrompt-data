The provided code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a`, which was previously a binary string, is now an integer. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
