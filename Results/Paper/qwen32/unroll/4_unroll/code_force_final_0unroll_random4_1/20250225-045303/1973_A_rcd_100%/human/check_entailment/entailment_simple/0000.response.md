### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games between three players given their final scores. The program first checks if the sum of the scores is even because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed between the two players (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve those scores with valid games, and the program outputs -1.

If the sum of scores is even, the program then checks if the highest score (`p3`) is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`). If this condition holds, it means that all games could have been between the player with the highest score and the other two players, and the maximum number of draws would be the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), because the player with `p3` could have won all games against the other two players, and the other two could have drawn among themselves.

If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws `x` and `y` such that the scores can be achieved. Specifically, it tries to balance the scores by adjusting the number of wins and draws such that the conditions are satisfied. The loop iterates, adjusting `x` and `y` until a valid configuration is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

The logic appears to correctly account for all possible configurations of wins and draws that could result in the given scores, ensuring that the maximum number of draws is calculated when possible.

### Correctness:

After analyzing the program's logic and its handling of various cases, it seems that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify impossible score configurations.

**Correctness: True**
