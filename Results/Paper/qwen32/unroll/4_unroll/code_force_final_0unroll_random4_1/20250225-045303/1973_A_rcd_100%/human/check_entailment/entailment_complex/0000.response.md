### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to understand if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective:** Determine the maximum number of draws possible given the scores of three players, or determine if the scores are impossible.
- **Score Rules:** 
  - A win gives 2 points to the winner.
  - A draw gives 1 point to each player.
- **Constraints:**
  - The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, i.e., \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
  - The sum of the scores must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players.

2. **Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible under the given rules.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is because the maximum possible draws would be the sum of the two lower scores, and the highest score can still be achieved through wins.
   - Otherwise, it uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws:
     - It initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to `p3`.
     - It iterates while `y >= x`, checking if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks.
     - If the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where no games were played (all scores are 0).
   - It also correctly identifies impossible score combinations.

#### Verification Against Examples:
- **Test Case 1:** `0 0 0` → No games, no draws → Output: `0`
- **Test Case 2:** `0 1 1` → One draw between the second and third player → Output: `1`
- **Test Case 3:** `1 1 1` → Impossible score combination → Output: `-1`
- **Test Case 4:** `1 1 2` → Two draws → Output: `2`
- **Test Case 5:** `3 3 3` → Impossible score combination → Output: `-1`
- **Test Case 6:** `3 4 5` → Six draws → Output: `6`
- **Test Case 7:** `1 1 10` → Two draws → Output: `2`

The program correctly handles all these test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify impossible score combinations.

**Correctness:** **True**
