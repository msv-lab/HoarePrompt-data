### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher amount to a container with a lower amount, where the source container must be to the left of the destination container.

The key steps in the program are:

1. **Calculate the total amount of water and the target amount per container:**
   - `total_water = sum(a)`: This calculates the total amount of water across all containers.
   - `target = total_water // n`: This calculates the target amount of water each container should have if the water is evenly distributed.

2. **Check if the water can be evenly distributed:**
   - The program uses a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative excess or deficit of water compared to the target.
   - As it iterates through the list of containers, it updates `container` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means there is an insufficient amount of water to fill the current container to the target amount using the water from the previous containers, and the program returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means the water can be distributed as required, and the program returns 'Yes'.

The logic is correct because:
- The sum of water is already guaranteed to be divisible by `n`, so the target calculation is valid.
- The cumulative check ensures that at no point is there a deficit of water that cannot be resolved by the water available in the previous containers.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The annotated states and the logic flow are consistent with the problem description.
