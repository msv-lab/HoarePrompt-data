The only object in the loop head is the variable `water`, which iterates over the list `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. 

Given the state before the loop starts, `a` is already defined as a list of `n` integers, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Since `n` is at least 1, the list `a` must have at least one element, ensuring that the loop can execute.

The variable `water` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `a` has at least one element, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, `total_water % n` equals 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is 0, `water` is the first element in the list `a`**
