Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain edge cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Call**: The program tries to call `func_1(n, a)` before defining the function `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and then tries to process it. However, it does not correctly handle multiple test cases. The program assumes that all the input is for a single test case, which is not the case as per the problem description.

3. **Logic for Checking Water Distribution**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level ever goes negative. This does not correctly determine if it's possible to redistribute the water as required. 

Let's provide a counterexample to illustrate the issue with the logic:

Consider the following test case:
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```

The correct output should be:
```
YES
YES
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
NO
```

This is because the program's logic does not correctly account for the possibility of redistributing water between containers. The key issue is that the program does not consider the possibility of pouring water from a container with more water to a container with less water in a way that allows all containers to eventually have the same amount of water.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the logic correctly handles multiple test cases and correctly determines if it's possible to redistribute the water. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly for multiple test cases and applies the logic properly.
