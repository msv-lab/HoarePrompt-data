### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games, or determine if the scores are invalid.

The key points to consider are:
1. Each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, 1 to each in case of a draw, or 0 to the loser).
2. The sum of all players' scores must be even because each game contributes exactly 2 points.
3. The maximum number of draws is determined by the total points and the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the scores `a`, `b`, and `c` are read and stored.

2. **Validation:**
   - The first check is whether the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If it's not, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, and `-1` is printed.
   
3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - If the scores sum is even, the variable `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, since each game contributes 2 points.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `a + b`. This represents the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of games played and the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

The logic in the program correctly handles the conditions described in the problem statement. It ensures that the scores are consistent with a valid set of games and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
