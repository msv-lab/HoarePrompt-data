The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length. For each test case, it determines if there is at least one character in `c` that is not present in either `a` or `b`. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
