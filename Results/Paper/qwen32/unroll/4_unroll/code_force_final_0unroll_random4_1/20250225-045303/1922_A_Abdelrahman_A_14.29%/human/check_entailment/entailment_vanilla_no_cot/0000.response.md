Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. 

Here are a few issues with the program:

1. The check `if c == a or c == b:` is incorrect. The problem requires checking if there is a template that makes `a` and `b` match while `c` does not match. This condition does not address that requirement.

2. The loop `for x in c:` is also incorrect. It checks if a character in `c` is not in `a` and `b`, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to check if there is a template that can be formed where `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not. This involves checking each character position in `a`, `b`, and `c` to see if a valid template character can be assigned for that position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        for j in range(slength):
            if a[j] == b[j]:
                # If a[j] and b[j] are the same, c[j] must be different from a[j]
                if c[j] == a[j]:
                    no = False
                    break
            else:
                # If a[j] and b[j] are different, c[j] must be the same as either a[j] or b[j]
                if c[j] != a[j] and c[j] != b[j]:
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version checks each character position to ensure that a valid template can be formed. If it finds a position where no valid template character can be assigned, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
