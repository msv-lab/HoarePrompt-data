Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from the input, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b` respectively; `a` is a binary string of length `n`; `b` is a binary string of length `m` read from the input; `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is set to 0, while the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were initially defined.
