You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two binary strings. It calculates and prints the number of characters in the first binary string that can be matched with characters in the second binary string in order. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The task is to find the maximum length \( k \) such that the prefix of string `a` of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string `b`. A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of the binary strings \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes two pointers: `k` to count the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` to traverse string `b`.
   - It iterates through each character in string `a` using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a while loop to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in `b` starting from position `j`.
   - If the character is found (`j < m`), it increments `k` and moves the pointer `j` to the next position in `b`.
   - If the character is not found (i.e., `j` reaches the end of `b`), it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program is correct. The program correctly finds the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` by using a two-pointer technique. It efficiently traverses both strings and ensures that the order of characters in `a` is maintained in `b`. The program handles all edge cases, such as when `a` is completely a subsequence of `b`, when `a` is not a subsequence at all, and when `a` is longer than `b`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
