Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the lines:
   ```python
   bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
   sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
   ```
   are incorrect because they do not correctly simulate the game's rules. The players either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation, adding the value from the array `a` to their score each turn. The `max` function is not appropriate in this context.

2. **Incorrect Loop Control:**
   The loop runs for `n` iterations, but it should run for `k` iterations (the number of turns). The decrement of `k` and the `break` statement are not correctly managing the loop to simulate exactly `k` turns.

3. **Incorrect Initialization of Scores:**
   The variables `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`, respectively, which is incorrect. They should be initialized to `a[b]` and `a[s]`, and then the loop should simulate the game for `k` turns, adding the values from the array `a` to the scores as the players move.

4. **Incorrect Indexing:**
   The program correctly adjusts the indices by subtracting 1, but the logic within the loop needs to be corrected to properly simulate the game.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[p[b] - 1]
            sp += a[p[s] - 1]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version properly simulates the game for `k` turns and calculates the scores correctly.
