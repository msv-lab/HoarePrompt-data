Reasoning:
Upon reviewing the program and the problem description, it's clear that the program does not correctly calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization and Scoring**:
   - The program initializes `bm` and `sm` to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`, respectively. This is incorrect because the players only add `a[x]` to their score at each turn, not `a[x] * k`.
   - Similarly, `bp` and `sp` are initialized to `a[b]` and `a[s]`, but they are not used correctly in the loop.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - Inside the loop, the program attempts to update scores by adding values based on `a[b]` and `a[s]`. However, the logic for updating the scores is flawed. Specifically, the lines `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` do not correctly reflect the scoring rules of the game.
   - The `max` function is incorrectly used here. The scores should simply be incremented by `a[b]` and `a[s]` at each turn, not compared with any other values.

3. **Index Handling**:
   - The program correctly converts `b` and `s` to zero-based indexing by subtracting 1 from `P_B` and `P_S`.
   - However, the conversion `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` is correct for updating the positions, but the score calculation is incorrect.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop runs for `k` turns, which is correct, but the score updates inside the loop are incorrect.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the final scores, but the scores themselves are not calculated correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game.

Correctness: **False**
