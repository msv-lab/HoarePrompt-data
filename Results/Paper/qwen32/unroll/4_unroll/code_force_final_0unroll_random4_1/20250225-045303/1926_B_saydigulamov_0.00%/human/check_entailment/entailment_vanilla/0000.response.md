Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a triangle or a square. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and the size of the grid for each test case correctly. However, it only appends the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' to the list `k`. This is insufficient to determine the shape.

2. **Shape Determination**: The program checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal and prints the list `k` if they are. This logic is incorrect for determining whether the shape is a square or a triangle. Specifically:
   - For a square, all rows containing '1's should have the same number of '1's, and this number should be equal to the distance of the leftmost '1' from the left edge of the grid.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of an arithmetic sequence starting from 1 and increasing by 2 for each subsequent row (or decreasing if it's an upside-down triangle).

3. **Output**: The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required. Instead, it prints the list `k` when the first two elements are equal, which is not a valid output for the problem.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
