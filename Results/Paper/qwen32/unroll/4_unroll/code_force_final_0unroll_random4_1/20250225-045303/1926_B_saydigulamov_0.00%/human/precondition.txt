t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of lists (or 2D list) where each element is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square consisting of '1's, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
