Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program only checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows (`k[0] == k[1]`) and prints the list `k`. This is insufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. The program does not implement any logic to verify the structure of the shape across all rows.

2. **Output Misalignment**: The program prints the list `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem description.

3. **Incomplete Handling**: The program does not handle cases where the shape is a triangle or a square correctly. It doesn't check for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
2
3
000
011
011
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

For the first test case, the grid is:
```
000
011
011
```
This is a square, but the program will print `[2, 2]` instead of "SQUARE".

For the second test case, the grid is:
```
0000
0000
0100
1110
```
This is a triangle, but the program will print `[1, 3]` instead of "TRIANGLE".

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
- Identify all rows that contain '1's.
- Check if the counts of '1's in these rows form a square or a triangle pattern.
- Print "SQUARE" if the counts form a square pattern.
- Print "TRIANGLE" if the counts form a triangle pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Find the rows with '1's
        ones_counts = [row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]
        
        # Check if it forms a square
        if len(set(ones_counts)) == 1:
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            # Check if it forms a triangle
            k = len(ones_counts)
            is_triangle = True
            for i in range(k):
                if ones_counts[i] != 2 * i + 1:
                    is_triangle = False
                    break
            if is_triangle:
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                # Check for upside-down triangle
                is_upside_down_triangle = True
                for i in range(k):
                    if ones_counts[i] != 2 * (k - i - 1) + 1:
                        is_upside_down_triangle = False
                        break
                if is_upside_down_triangle:
                    print("TRIANGLE")
                else:
                    print("UNKNOWN")  # This line should never be reached as per problem statement

func()
```

This corrected version checks for both triangle and square patterns and prints the correct shape for each test case.
