The provided code snippet only includes the setup for reading input from standard input. It does not perform any operations that would change the initial state of the variables or introduce new variables. Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of the `input` function being defined to read from standard input.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. The next two lines contain binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `input` is a function that reads a line from standard input.**
