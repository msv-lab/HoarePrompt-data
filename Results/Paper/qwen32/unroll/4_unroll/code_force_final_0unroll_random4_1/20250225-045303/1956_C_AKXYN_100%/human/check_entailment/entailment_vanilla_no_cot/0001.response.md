Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap

- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix filled with zeroes.
- **Operations**:
  - **Type 1**: Assign a row `i` with a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to n.
  - **Type 2**: Assign a column `i` with a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to n.
- **Constraints**:
  - No more than `2n` operations.
  - The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed `5 * 10^5`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` representing the size of the matrix.
   - It initializes the matrix `mat` with rows filled with permutations from 1 to n.

2. **Result Calculation**:
   - The variable `res` is initialized to 0.
   - The program calculates the sum of the series `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - This formula is supposed to yield the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations, which is `n << 1` (i.e., `2n`).
   - It then prints `2n` operations, alternating between Type 1 and Type 2 operations, each time assigning the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to a row or column.

### Evaluation

- **Correctness of the Result Calculation**:
  - The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not correspond to the maximum sum of the matrix. The maximum sum is actually the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is `n^2 * (n^2 + 1) / 2`. This is because each cell in the matrix can be filled with a unique number from 1 to `n^2`.
  - The program incorrectly calculates the sum, leading to an incorrect result.

- **Correctness of Operations**:
  - The operations printed by the program do not guarantee the maximum sum. The operations are simply assigning the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to each row and column, but this does not ensure the maximum sum as each cell should ideally be filled with a unique number from 1 to `n^2`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not provide the correct sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
