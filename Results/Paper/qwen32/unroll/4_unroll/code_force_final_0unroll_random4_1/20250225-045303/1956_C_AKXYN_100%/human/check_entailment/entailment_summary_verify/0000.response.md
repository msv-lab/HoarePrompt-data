Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly maximizes the sum of all the numbers in the matrix according to the problem description.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix filled with zeroes using Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
- **Operations**:
  - **Type 1**: Assign a row with a permutation.
  - **Type 2**: Assign a column with a permutation.
- **Constraints**: No more than `2n` operations.
- **Output**: The maximum sum and the operations used to achieve it.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   - This initializes each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Result Calculation**:
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   - The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is not the correct way to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. This formula seems to be related to the sum of squares but does not account for the optimal arrangement of numbers in the matrix.

3. **Operations**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   - The program prints operations to assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to each row and column, which is not optimal for maximizing the sum.

### Correct Calculation of the Maximum Sum:
- The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers from 1 to `n^2` such that each number appears exactly once in each row and each column. This is equivalent to filling the matrix with a Latin square.
- The sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers is:
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{n^2 \times (n^2 + 1)}{2}
  \]

### Correct Operations:
- To achieve this maximum sum, we can use the identity permutation for each row and column, which ensures that each number from 1 to `n` appears exactly once in each row and each column.
- The operations can be:
  - Assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to each row.
  - Assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to each column.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        res = n * (n * n + 1) // 2  # Sum of all numbers from 1 to n^2
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not maximize the sum of the matrix.
- The formula used to calculate `res` in the original program is incorrect.
- The operations printed by the original program are not optimal for maximizing the sum.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix.

**Final: False**
