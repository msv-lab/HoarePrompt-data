### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the sum calculation in the program. The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` used in the program does not accurately compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix. Instead, the correct formula for the sum of all elements in the matrix when each row and each column is filled with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n] is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Matrix Initialization and Operations**:
   - The program correctly initializes the matrix with each row filled with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n].
   - It then performs `2 * n` operations: for each row and column, it fills it with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - Since each number from 1 to `n` appears exactly `n` times in the matrix (once per row and once per column), the total sum of the matrix is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the calculated sum and the number of operations correctly, but the sum is incorrect due to the wrong formula.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the sum calculation. The program needs to be corrected to use the proper formula for the sum.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue and suggests a correction.
