Let's analyze the correctness of the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Recap:
We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Points:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: To maximize the sum, we should aim to have the largest possible numbers in the matrix.
2. **Operations**: We can perform type 1 and type 2 operations to achieve this.
3. **Constraints**: The total number of operations should not exceed \( 2n \).

### Analysis:
- The program initializes the matrix with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row.
- It calculates the sum of the matrix using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\).
- It then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations as \(2n\).
- For each row and column, it prints the operations to fill them with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\) does not correctly represent the maximum sum possible in the matrix.
2. **Operations**: The operations printed do not actually maximize the sum. The program fills each row and column with the same permutation, which is not optimal.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum, we can fill each row with a permutation that maximizes the sum of each row and column. One way to do this is to fill the first row with `[1, 2, ..., n]`, the second row with `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`, and so on. This way, each number from 1 to \( n \) appears in each row and each column exactly once, and the sum is maximized.

### Correct Sum Calculation:
The maximum sum is simply \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers multiplied by \( n \).

### Correct Operations:
We can achieve this by performing \( n \) type 1 operations (one for each row) with the appropriate permutations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not perform the operations in a way that maximizes the sum.

**Correctness: False**
