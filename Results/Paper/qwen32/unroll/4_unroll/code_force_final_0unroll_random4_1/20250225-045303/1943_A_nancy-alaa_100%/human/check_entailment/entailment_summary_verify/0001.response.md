### Reasoning

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which she builds).
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Provided Program:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each element in the array `a`.
- It then iterates through non-negative integers starting from 0.
- It prints the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in `a` or appears exactly once in `a` after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once.

#### Analysis:
1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - If an integer `i` is not in the array `a`, then `i` is the MEX.
   - If all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `a`, the MEX is `n`.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice and Bob's optimal strategies are not directly simulated in the code.
   - However, the key insight is that the MEX can be determined by the frequency of elements in `a` and the rules of the game.
   - If an integer `i` appears an even number of times in `a`, it can be paired such that Bob can always delete one of them, leaving Alice with the other.
   - If an integer `i` appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure that it is included in `c` by picking it first.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through non-negative integers from 0 to `n`.
   - It prints the first integer that is either not present in `a` or appears exactly once after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal play strategies and the pairing of elements.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves determining the smallest integer `i` such that the number of elements less than `i` is even.
- This ensures that Alice can always pick elements to maximize the MEX.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategies of Alice and Bob. The logic in the program is flawed and does not simulate the game dynamics properly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
