Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. The current implementation simply looks for the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array or has a specific frequency pattern, which does not align with the optimal gameplay described in the problem.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the frequency of elements, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by checking the frequency of elements and printing the first integer that either does not exist in the array or appears only once after the first such number. This does not account for the optimal moves that Alice and Bob would make during the game.

3. **Lack of Simulation**: The program does not simulate the game process where elements are alternately picked by Alice and Bob, and the MEX is calculated based on the final state of `c`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game process, taking into account the optimal moves of both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def mex(arr):
    i = 0
    while True:
        if i not in arr:
            return i
        i += 1

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        c = []
        turn = "Alice"
        
        while arr:
            if turn == "Alice":
                # Alice picks the largest available number to maximize MEX
                for num in sorted(mpp.keys(), reverse=True):
                    if mpp[num] > 0:
                        c.append(num)
                        mpp[num] -= 1
                        if mpp[num] == 0:
                            del mpp[num]
                        break
                turn = "Bob"
            else:
                # Bob picks the smallest available number to minimize MEX
                for num in sorted(mpp.keys()):
                    if mpp[num] > 0:
                        mpp[num] -= 1
                        if mpp[num] == 0:
                            del mpp[num]
                        break
                turn = "Alice"
        
        print(mex(c))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program simulates the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements optimally, and then calculates the MEX of the final array `c`.
