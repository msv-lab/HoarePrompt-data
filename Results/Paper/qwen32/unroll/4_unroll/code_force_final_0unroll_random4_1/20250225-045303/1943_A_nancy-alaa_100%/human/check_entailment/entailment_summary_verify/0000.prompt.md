You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in the list `a` or appears exactly once in the list `a` after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. The current implementation simply looks for the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array or has a specific frequency pattern, which does not align with the optimal gameplay described in the problem.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the frequency of elements, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by checking the frequency of elements and printing the first integer that either does not exist in the array or appears only once after the first such number. This does not account for the optimal moves that Alice and Bob would make during the game.

3. **Lack of Simulation**: The program does not simulate the game process where elements are alternately picked by Alice and Bob, and the MEX is calculated based on the final state of `c`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game process, taking into account the optimal moves of both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def mex(arr):
    i = 0
    while True:
        if i not in arr:
            return i
        i += 1

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        c = []
        turn = "Alice"
        
        while arr:
            if turn == "Alice":
                # Alice picks the largest available number to maximize MEX
                for num in sorted(mpp.keys(), reverse=True):
                    if mpp[num] > 0:
                        c.append(num)
                        mpp[num] -= 1
                        if mpp[num] == 0:
                            del mpp[num]
                        break
                turn = "Bob"
            else:
                # Bob picks the smallest available number to minimize MEX
                for num in sorted(mpp.keys()):
                    if mpp[num] > 0:
                        mpp[num] -= 1
                        if mpp[num] == 0:
                            del mpp[num]
                        break
                turn = "Alice"
        
        print(mex(c))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program simulates the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements optimally, and then calculates the MEX of the final array `c`.
