Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the picked element from `a` without adding it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategies**:
   - Alice will try to add elements to `c` that will increase the MEX as much as possible.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from adding elements that would increase the MEX.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - Since the array `a` contains elements from `0` to `n-1`, the possible MEX values range from `0` to `n`.

4. **Key Insight**:
   - If there is a number `i` that appears exactly once in `a`, Alice can add this to `c` on her turn to increase the MEX.
   - If all numbers from `0` to `n-1` appear an even number of times, Bob can always prevent Alice from adding a new number to `c` that would increase the MEX.
   - If there is any number `i` that appears an odd number of times, Alice can add it to `c` to increase the MEX.
   - The first number `i` that appears an odd number of times in `a` will be the MEX of `c` if both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n` and checks the count of each number:
- If a number `i` is not present in the array (i.e., its count is `0`), it prints `i` as the MEX.
- If a number `i` appears exactly once and it's the first such number encountered, it prints `i` as the MEX.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the first number with an odd count is the MEX. This is not necessarily true. The MEX is the smallest number that is not present in `c` at the end of the game.
   - The program does not simulate the game turns or the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics. It simply checks for the first number with an odd count and prints it, which does not account for the turns and the strategies of both players.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It fails to simulate the game and instead makes an incorrect assumption about the MEX based on the count of elements.

**Correctness: False**
