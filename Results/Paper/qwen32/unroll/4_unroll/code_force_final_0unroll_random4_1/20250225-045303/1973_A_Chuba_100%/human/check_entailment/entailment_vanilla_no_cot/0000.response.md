To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and check if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \). The key points are:
- Each game results in either 2 points for the winner, 0 for the loser, or 1 point each in case of a draw.
- The total points across all games must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if there's a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it's a draw).
- The maximum number of draws should be calculated if possible, otherwise, return -1 if the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).
3. It checks if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total sum with the given scoring rules.
4. If the total points are even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - \max(0, p_2 - p_0 - p_1)}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that we maximize the number of draws while respecting the constraints.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:** `0 0 0`
   - Total points: \( 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \) (even)
   - Result: \( \frac{0 + 0 + 0 - \max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)}{2} = 0 \)
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2:** `0 1 1`
   - Total points: \( 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \) (even)
   - Result: \( \frac{0 + 1 + 1 - \max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)}{2} = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3:** `1 1 1`
   - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \) (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Test Case 4:** `1 1 2`
   - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \) (even)
   - Result: \( \frac{1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 1 - 1 - 1)}{2} = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Test Case 5:** `3 3 3`
   - Total points: \( 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \) (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Test Case 6:** `3 4 5`
   - Total points: \( 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 \) (even)
   - Result: \( \frac{3 + 4 + 5 - \max(0, 4 - 3 - 3)}{2} = 6 \)
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Test Case 7:** `1 1 10`
   - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \) (even)
   - Result: \( \frac{1 + 1 + 10 - \max(0, 1 - 1 - 1)}{2} = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
