### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program using the problem description, the code, the original assessment, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires determining the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players given their final scores. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and the total points awarded in each game are either 2 (for a win/loss) or 2 (for a draw).

#### Key Observations
1. **Total Points Parity**: The sum of the scores must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores, and the output should be -1.
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The formula used in the code aims to maximize the number of draws by minimizing the number of win/loss games. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that the highest score \( p_3 \) does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players by more than necessary, thus minimizing the number of win/loss games.

#### Code Analysis
The code logic is as follows:
- The code reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).
- It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints -1.
- If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula and prints the result.

#### Verification with Examples
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Sum is 0 (even).
   - No games were played, so the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - **Expected Output**: `0`
   - **Actual Output**: `0`

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Sum is 2 (even).
   - One draw between the second and third player.
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Actual Output**: `1`

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Sum is 3 (odd).
   - Impossible to achieve these scores.
   - **Expected Output**: `-1`
   - **Actual Output**: `-1`

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Sum is 4 (even).
   - Two draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `2`
   - **Actual Output**: `2`

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Sum is 9 (odd).
   - Impossible to achieve these scores.
   - **Expected Output**: `-1`
   - **Actual Output**: `-1`

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Six draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `6`
   - **Actual Output**: `6`

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Two draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `2`
   - **Actual Output**: `2`

#### Evaluation
The code correctly handles all the provided examples and follows the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are impossible. The logic and the formula used in the code are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis and verification, the given program is correct.

Final: **True**
