### Reasoning:

1. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program outputs `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (since each game distributes 2 points in total, either 2 to a winner and 0 to a loser, or 1 to each in the case of a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws. The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - This formula works because:
     - `v[2]` is the highest score, and `v[0]` and `v[1]` are the other two scores.
     - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that we do not count more points than are available from the games played between the highest scorer and the other two players.
     - Subtracting this term from the total sum of scores and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws possible.

3. **Validation with Examples:**
   - The program correctly handles the given examples:
     - For `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and no games were played, so the result is `0`.
     - For `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and one draw between the second and third player gives the result `1`.
     - For `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), so the result is `-1`.
     - For `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and two draws (one between the second and third player, and one between the first and one of the other two players) gives the result `2`.
     - For `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), so the result is `-1`.
     - For `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and six draws (three between each pair of players) gives the result `6`.
     - For `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and two draws (one between the second and third player, and one between the first and one of the other two players) gives the result `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and passes the provided examples. Thus, the program is correct.
