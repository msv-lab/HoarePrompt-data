The code sets the values of `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` to `False`. The other variables and their initial states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `True` values with length `num + 1` except `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` are `False`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`.**
