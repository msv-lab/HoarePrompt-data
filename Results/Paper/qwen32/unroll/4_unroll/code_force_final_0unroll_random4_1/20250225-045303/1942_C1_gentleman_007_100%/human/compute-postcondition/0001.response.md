Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `True` values with length `num + 1`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`.**

The variable `Highest_Prime` is now a list of zeros with the same length as `num + 1`. The values of `num` and `prime` remain unchanged.
