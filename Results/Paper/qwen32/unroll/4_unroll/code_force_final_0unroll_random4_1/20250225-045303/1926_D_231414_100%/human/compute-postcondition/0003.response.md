To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the provided code snippet.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The outer loop runs `times` number of times, where each iteration corresponds to a separate test case.
   - For each test case, the number of integers `n` is read, followed by the list `data` of `n` integers.
   - Some variables are initialized: `dic` as an empty dictionary, `ans` as 0, and `check` as 2147483647 (which is equivalent to \(2^{31} - 1\)).

2. **Processing Each Integer in `data`**:
   - For each integer `i` in `data`, the code calculates `s` as `i ^ check` (bitwise XOR of `i` and `check`).
   - The code then uses a dictionary `dic` to keep track of the counts of certain values:
     - If `i` is already in `dic`, it decrements the count. If the count becomes zero, it removes `i` from the dictionary.
     - If `i` is not in `dic`, it checks if `s` is not in `dic`. If not, it initializes `dic[s]` to 0 and then increments it by 1. It also increments `ans` by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all integers in `data`, the code prints the value of `ans`.

### Key Observations:
- The variable `ans` is incremented whenever a new `s` value (which is `i ^ check`) is encountered and not already in the dictionary.
- The variable `dic` is used to track the counts of `s` values.
- The variable `check` is a constant value \(2^{31} - 1\) and remains unchanged throughout the execution of each test case.

### Final State:
- After all test cases are processed, the variables `n`, `data`, `dic`, `ans`, and `check` will be in their final states corresponding to the last test case processed.
- The variable `times` will remain unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- The variables `t` and `check` (as a global variable) will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Output State:
The output state will reflect the final values of the variables after all test cases have been processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the number of integers in the last test case; `a` is the list of integers in the last test case; `times` is the input integer representing the number of test cases; `check` is 2147483647; `dic` is a dictionary reflecting the counts of `s` values from the last test case; `ans` is the final count of unique `s` values encountered in the last test case.**
