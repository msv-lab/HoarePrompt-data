You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks a specific condition related to the permutation described by `p` and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether the condition is met. Specifically, it prints `2` if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`; otherwise, it prints `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party. A friend will attend if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the number of friends `x`.
2. Reads the list `l` of best friends.
3. Iterates through each friend to check if there is a mutual best friendship (i.e., if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`).
4. If a mutual best friendship is found, it prints `2` and breaks the loop.
5. If no mutual best friendship is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis
Let's consider the logic:
- **Mutual Best Friendship**: If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, it means that friend `i` and friend `l[i]` are each other's best friends. In this case, inviting both of them is sufficient to ensure that both attend the party, so the program correctly outputs `2`.
- **No Mutual Best Friendship**: If no mutual best friendship is found, the program outputs `3`. However, this is not necessarily correct. There might be a scenario where inviting three friends can ensure that at least two attend, but the program does not consider all possible combinations of invitations.

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
In this case, there are no mutual best friendships. However, inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 would result in friends 2 and 3 attending the party (since 2's best friend is 3 and 3's best friend is 4, but 3 will attend because 2 is invited, and 2 will attend because 1 is invited, and 1 will attend because 5 is invited, but 5 is not invited, but 3 will attend because 2 is invited, and 4 will not attend because 5 is not invited). Therefore, the minimum number of invitations needed is `3`, and the program would correctly output `3` in this case. However, the program does not consider other possible combinations that might result in fewer invitations.

### Conclusion
The program handles the case where there is a mutual best friendship correctly by outputting `2`. However, it incorrectly assumes that if no mutual best friendship is found, the answer is always `3` without considering other possible combinations of invitations. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct answer for all test cases.
