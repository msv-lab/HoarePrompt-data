You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks a specific condition related to the permutation described by `p` and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether the condition is met. Specifically, it prints `2` if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`; otherwise, it prints `3`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect and provide a counterexample.

The current code logic is as follows:
1. It iterates through the list of friends.
2. It checks if a friend and their best friend form a mutual best friendship (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`).
3. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
4. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

This logic is flawed because:
- It does not account for all possible configurations of mutual best friendships.
- It incorrectly assumes that if no mutual best friendship is found, the answer is always `3`.

Let's consider a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
4
2 3 4 1

Output:
3
```

According to the problem description, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, and both of them will attend because:
- Friend 1 and friend 2 are best friends.
- Friend 2 and friend 3 are best friends.
- Friend 3 and friend 4 are best friends.
- Friend 4 and friend 1 are best friends.

By inviting friends 1 and 2, friends 1 and 2 will attend. Thus, the minimum number of invitations needed is `2`, not `3`.

Another counterexample:
```
Input:
1
5
3 1 2 5 4

Output:
2
```

This is correct based on the problem description. However, the code might not handle all configurations correctly.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Identifying all mutual best friendships.
2. Using a graph-based approach to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given the current implementation, it is not guaranteed to work for all cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
