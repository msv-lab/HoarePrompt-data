The provided code snippet does not match the initial state description. The code seems to be designed to handle a different problem where it processes test cases involving a single integer `l` and calculates a value `s` based on it. However, the initial state describes a problem involving coordinates of the corners of squares.

Given the provided code, here is the output state based on the code's execution:

The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` using the formula `s += (l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2`, and prints `s`. The variable `n` is decremented by 1 after each test case.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `n` or `l`, we can only describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1 for each test case, `s` is calculated and printed for each test case based on the formula `s += (l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2`. The initial state of the coordinates of the squares is not affected by this code.**

However, if we assume the intention was to match the initial state description, the provided code does not process the square coordinates as described. Therefore, the output state strictly based on the provided code is as described above.
