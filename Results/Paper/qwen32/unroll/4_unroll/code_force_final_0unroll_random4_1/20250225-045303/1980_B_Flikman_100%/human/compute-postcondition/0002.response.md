Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each containing either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions checked within the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged, representing the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop based on the input for each test case and are not preserved across iterations. After all iterations, the only state that remains relevant is the sequence of printed outputs ('YES', 'NO', 'MAYBE') corresponding to each test case.**
