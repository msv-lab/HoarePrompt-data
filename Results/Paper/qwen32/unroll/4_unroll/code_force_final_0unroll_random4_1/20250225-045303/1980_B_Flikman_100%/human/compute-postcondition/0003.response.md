Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value based on the conditions related to `f`, `k`, and the elements in `a`. Specifically, Case_1: If a certain condition related to `f`, `k`, and the elements in `a` is met, it returns a specific result; Case_2: If the condition in Case_1 is not met, it returns a different result.**
