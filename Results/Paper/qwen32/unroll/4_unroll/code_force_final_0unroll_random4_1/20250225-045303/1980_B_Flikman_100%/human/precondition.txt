test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: a tuple of integers (n, f, k) representing the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes respectively, and a list of integers a_i representing the values shown on the cubes. It is given that for each test case, 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 100. The length of test_cases is between 1 and 1000.
