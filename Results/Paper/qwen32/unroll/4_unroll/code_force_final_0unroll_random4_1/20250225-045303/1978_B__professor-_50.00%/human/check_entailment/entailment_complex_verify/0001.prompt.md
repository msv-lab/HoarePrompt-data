You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: t lines, each containing the result of the corresponding input set based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the conditions involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. The final state of the program is that it outputs `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of the respective test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has `n` buns to sell. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b`, and the rest at the usual price `a`. The goal is to maximize profit.

The price of the i-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is (b - i + 1). The price of the remaining (n - k) buns is `a`.

### Key Observations

1. **If `b <= a`**:
   Selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit because the promotion price is not beneficial.

2. **If `b - a >= n`**:
   Selling all buns at the promotion price will yield the maximum profit. The total profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series: (b - 0) + (b - 1) + ... + (b - (n-1)).

3. **If `b - a < n`**:
   This is the more complex case. Here, we need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes profit. The profit from selling `k` buns at the promotion price is the sum of the series (b - 0) + (b - 1) + ... + (b - (k-1)), and the profit from selling the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price `a` is `a * (n - k)`. We need to find the `k` that maximizes this combined profit.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the program's logic:

1. **If `b <= a`**:
   The program correctly prints `n * a`, which is the profit from selling all buns at the usual price.

2. **If `b - a >= n`**:
   The program correctly calculates the total profit from selling all buns at the promotion price using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

3. **If `b - a < n`**:
   The program's logic here seems incorrect. The formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for this case. The optimal `k` should be determined by finding the point where the profit from the promotion price starts to decrease compared to the usual price `a`.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the program is incorrect for the case where `b - a < n`. The program does not correctly determine the optimal `k` for this case.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where `b - a < n` correctly, and thus does not always yield the maximum profit.
