Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program code to determine if it correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case.

### Problem Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins. The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program has three cases:
1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - **Output:** `n * a`
2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
   - **Output:** Sum of the series from `b` to `b - n + 1`.
     - This is equivalent to the formula: \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\)
3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference is less than the number of buns, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - **Output:** Sum of the series from `b` to `a + 1` plus the remaining buns at the usual price.
     - This is equivalent to the formula: \(\frac{(b + a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a))\).

### Issues in the Program:
The third case in the program is indeed incorrect. The formula used in the program for this case is:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```
This formula does not correctly compute the maximum profit for the third case. The correct formula should be:
```python
k = min(b - a + 1, n)  # k should be the minimum of (b - a + 1) and n
profit = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
```
The original program does not correctly compute the sum of the series when `b - a < n`. Specifically, it calculates the sum of the series from `b` to `a + 1` incorrectly, and it does not account for the remaining buns correctly.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Let's consider the test case:
- `n = 10, a = 10, b = 15`
- According to the problem, the optimal `k` would be 5 (i.e., sell the first 5 buns at modified price and the remaining 5 at usual price).
- Expected profit: \( (15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 11) + (5 \cdot 10) = 65 + 50 = 115 \)
- Program output: \(\frac{(15 - 10) \cdot (15 - 10 + 1)}{2} + 10 \cdot 10 = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{2} + 100 = 15 + 100 = 115 \) (this is coincidentally correct for this case, but the formula is incorrect in general)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically the third case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
