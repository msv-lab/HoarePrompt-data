#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `res` is the number of unique numbers in `a` that were not previously in `count` when they were first encountered; `count` is a dictionary reflecting the net count of each number and its bitwise complement encountered during the loop.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the number of unique numbers in the list `a` that were not previously in the dictionary `count` when they were first encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns the count of unique numbers in the list `a` that were not previously encountered when they were first seen.
