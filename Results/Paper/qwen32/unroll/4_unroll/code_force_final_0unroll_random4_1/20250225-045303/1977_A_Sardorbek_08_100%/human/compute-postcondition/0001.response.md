To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(a)`, so we need to consider the variable `a` and how it affects the loop execution.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100
- `a` is an input integer

The loop will execute if the range function `range(a)` generates at least one value. This means `a` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Since `a` is the only variable in the loop head that affects whether the loop executes, we need to ensure that `a` is greater than 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not directly impact the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `a` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` must be greater than 0**
