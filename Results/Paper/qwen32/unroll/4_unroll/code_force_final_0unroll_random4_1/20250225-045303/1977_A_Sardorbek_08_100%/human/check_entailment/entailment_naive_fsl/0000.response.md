Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed.

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `b == c`, it correctly prints "YES" because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
- If `b < c`, it correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes". This logic is incorrect. The condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. For example, if `b = 5` and `c = 1`, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is true (both are odd), but it's impossible to end up with 1 cube after 5 moves.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: `1 5 1`
- Expected Output: "NO"
- Actual Output: "Yes"

In this case, `b = 5` (moves) and `c = 1` (cubes). The program incorrectly prints "Yes" because `5 % 2 == 1 % 2` (both are odd), but it's not possible to end up with 1 cube after 5 moves.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
