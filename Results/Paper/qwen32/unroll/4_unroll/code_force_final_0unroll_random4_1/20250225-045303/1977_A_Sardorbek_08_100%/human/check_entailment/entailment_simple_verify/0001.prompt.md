You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; a is an input integer.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The number of cubes `m` can only be achieved if:
  - The difference between `n` (total moves) and `m` (target cubes) is even. This is because each pair of moves (add then remove or remove then add) leaves the number of cubes unchanged.
  - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `n` equals `m`, it's possible if all moves are additions, hence the answer would be "Yes".

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down how the program handles these cases:
1. **If `b == c`:** The program correctly prints 'YES'. This is because if the number of moves `n` equals the number of cubes `m`, it's possible to build the tower by adding one cube in each move.
2. **If `b < c`:** The program correctly prints 'NO'. This is because if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes as we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. **If `b % 2 == c % 2`:** The program correctly prints 'Yes'. This is because if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is the same, it's possible to reach `m` cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
4. **Otherwise:** The program correctly prints 'No'. This covers the case where the parity of `n` and `m` is different, meaning it's not possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases mentioned above and adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
