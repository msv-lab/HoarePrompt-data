Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The number of cubes `m` can only be achieved if:
  - The difference between `n` (total moves) and `m` (target cubes) is even. This is because each pair of moves (add then remove or remove then add) leaves the number of cubes unchanged.
  - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `n` equals `m`, it's possible if all moves are additions, hence the answer would be "Yes".

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down how the program handles these cases:
1. **If `b == c`:** The program correctly prints 'YES'. This is because if the number of moves `n` equals the number of cubes `m`, it's possible to build the tower by adding one cube in each move.
2. **If `b < c`:** The program correctly prints 'NO'. This is because if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes as we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. **If `b % 2 == c % 2`:** The program correctly prints 'Yes'. This is because if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is the same, it's possible to reach `m` cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
4. **Otherwise:** The program correctly prints 'No'. This covers the case where the parity of `n` and `m` is different, meaning it's not possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases mentioned above and adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
