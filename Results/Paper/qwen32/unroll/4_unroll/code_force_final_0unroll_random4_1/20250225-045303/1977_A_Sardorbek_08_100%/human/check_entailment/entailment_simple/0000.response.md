Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to determine if it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it checks the relationship between `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).

Let's break down the logic used in the program:

1. If `b == c` (i.e., `n == m`), then the output is 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is equal to the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve `m` cubes.

2. If `b < c` (i.e., `n < m`), then the output is 'NO'. This is correct because if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves since each move can only add one cube.

3. If `b % 2 == c % 2` (i.e., `n % 2 == m % 2`), then the output is 'YES'. This is correct because if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. This can be achieved by adding cubes in such a way that the difference between `n` and `m` is even (since each pair of add and remove operations will not change the parity of the number of cubes).

4. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This is correct because if `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves because the parity of the number of cubes will always remain the same as the parity of the number of moves.

The logic in the program correctly handles all possible scenarios and produces the correct output for each test case based on the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
