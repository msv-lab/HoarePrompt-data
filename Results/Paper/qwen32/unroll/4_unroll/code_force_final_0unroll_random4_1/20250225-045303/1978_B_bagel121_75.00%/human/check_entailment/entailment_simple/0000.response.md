### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Logic for Maximum Profit**:
   - If `a >= b`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at the modified price would yield less or the same profit.
   - If `a < b`, Bob should consider selling the first `k` buns at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without the price dropping below `a`. This is calculated as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
   - The profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price is \((n - k) * a\).
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the calculated maximum profit.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation: `a < b`, so `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`. Profit = \((5 + 4) / 2 * 2 + (4 - 2) * 4 = 9 + 8 = 17\).
   - Output: `17` (matches).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation: `a < b`, so `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`. Profit = \((9 + 5) / 2 * 5 = 35\).
   - Output: `35` (matches).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation: `a >= b`, so Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`.
   - Output: `100` (matches).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation: `a < b`, so `k = min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`. Profit = \((11 + 6) / 2 * 5 = 45\).
   - Output: `45` (matches).

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `a >= b`, so Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`.
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (matches).

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation: `a >= b`, so Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`.
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (matches).

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation: `a < b`, so `k = min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`. Profit = \((1000 + 1) / 2 * 1000 = 500500\).
   - Output: `500500` (matches).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain and produces the correct output for all the provided test cases.
