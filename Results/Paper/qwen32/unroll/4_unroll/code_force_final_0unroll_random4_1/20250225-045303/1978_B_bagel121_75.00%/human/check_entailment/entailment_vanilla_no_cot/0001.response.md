Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Bob sells buns with a usual price `a` and a promotion price for the first `k` buns which decreases by 1 coin for each subsequent bun sold under promotion. The goal is to maximize the profit from selling all `n` buns.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - The program first checks if `a >= b`. If true, it means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit because the promotion price is not beneficial (it would be lower or equal to `a`).
   - If `a < b`, the program proceeds to determine the optimal number of buns `k` to sell under promotion. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n` because selling more than `b - a + 1` buns under promotion would result in a price less than or equal to `a`, which is not beneficial.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the total profit from selling `k` buns under promotion using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `sum = (first_term + last_term) / 2 * number_of_terms`. Here, the first term is `b`, and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
   - It then calculates the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Finally, it adds both parts of the profit and prints the result.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Case 1: `a >= b`**
  - The program correctly outputs `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price is the best option.
  
- **Case 2: `a < b`**
  - The program correctly identifies the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
  - It calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the sum of the arithmetic series formula, which is correct.
  - It calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`, which is also correct.
  - The total profit is the sum of these two parts, which is the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both cases and computes the maximum profit for each test case as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
