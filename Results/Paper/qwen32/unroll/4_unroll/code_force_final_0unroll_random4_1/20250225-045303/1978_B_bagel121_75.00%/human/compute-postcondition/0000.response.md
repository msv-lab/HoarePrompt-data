The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases or lines of input that will follow. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case are mentioned to be provided in the subsequent lines, but the code snippet itself does not process these lines. Therefore, the only change in the state is the assignment of the input value to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9.**
