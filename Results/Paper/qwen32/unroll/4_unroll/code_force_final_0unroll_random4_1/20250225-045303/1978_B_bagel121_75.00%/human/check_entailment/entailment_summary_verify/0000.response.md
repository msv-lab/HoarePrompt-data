### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program code and the function summary to verify the correctness of the given solution.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns, with a usual price `a` and a promotional price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1` for the first `k` buns. The goal is to maximize profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. If `a >= b`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
2. If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` and computes the total profit:
   - `k` is determined as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series formula.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is calculated by multiplying `(n - k)` with `a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior:
- If `a >= b`, it prints `n * a`.
- If `a < b`, it calculates the sum of the promotional prices for the first `k` buns and adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **`n = 1`**:
   - If `a >= b`, the profit is `a`.
   - If `a < b`, the profit is `b`.
   - The program correctly handles this by choosing `k = 1` if `a < b` or `k = 0` if `a >= b`.

2. **`b = a`**:
   - The profit is always `n * a` since `k` will be `0`.
   - The program correctly handles this by choosing `k = 0`.

3. **`b < a`**:
   - Similar to the case `b = a`, the profit is `n * a` and `k` will be `0`.
   - The program correctly handles this by choosing `k = 0`.

4. **`k = n`**:
   - If `n <= b - a + 1`, all buns are sold at promotional prices.
   - The program correctly calculates the total profit using the arithmetic series sum formula.

5. **`k < n`**:
   - If `n > b - a + 1`, only the first `b - a + 1` buns are sold at promotional prices.
   - The program correctly calculates the total profit by summing the promotional prices for the first `k` buns and adding the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.

#### Verification:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. The arithmetic series sum formula used to calculate the profit from the first `k` buns is accurate. The program ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the number of distinct promotional prices available (`b - a + 1`).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. There are no apparent issues or cases where the program fails to produce the expected result.

**Final: True**
