In the provided task, the for loop iterates based on the integer value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t` implicitly through `int(input())`. The variables `n`, `s`, and `f` are defined within the loop body, so they do not need to be adjusted in the initial state.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1, as the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times and does not need to be initialized or adjusted.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
