The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is controlled by the `range(n)`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variables `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st` are not directly related to the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is n-1, `st` is a set used to store midpoints visited during the binary search, `n` must be greater than 0**
