You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each grid, it determines if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if the first column is uniform and different from the last column. If either condition is true, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and changing all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. It reads the dimensions of the grid (n and m).
2. It reads the grid row by row.
3. It constructs two strings:
   - `first_row`: the first character of each row.
   - `last_row`: the last character of each row.
4. It checks if the first row has all the same characters and is different from the last row. If so, it prints "NO".
5. It checks if the first column (constructed from `first_row`) has all the same characters and is different from the last column (constructed from `last_row`). If so, it prints "NO".
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis:
The program's logic is based on the observation that if the first and last rows (or columns) are different and consist of only one color, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. However, this logic is not sufficient to cover all cases.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
2 3
BWW
WBW
```
- The first row is "BWW" and the last row is "WBW". Both have more than one unique character, so the program would print "YES".
- However, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations. We cannot change the middle column to be all 'B' or all 'W' while keeping the rest of the grid consistent.

Another example:
```
3 3
BWW
WBW
BWW
```
- The first row is "BWW" and the last row is "BWW", which are the same.
- The first column is "BWB" and the last column is "WWB", which are different and each has more than one unique character, so the program would print "YES".
- However, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
