### Reasoning:

The program provided is designed to determine whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. The logic of the program is based on the observation that if there is a uniform row or column that is different from the last row or column, then it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform through the described operations. This is because such a row or column would act as a barrier that cannot be changed to match the rest of the grid without violating the operation rules.

However, the provided logic is not entirely correct. The program only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns for uniformity and differences. This is not sufficient to determine whether the entire grid can be made uniform. For example, consider a grid where the first row is all 'W', the last row is all 'B', and the middle rows alternate between 'W' and 'B'. The program would incorrectly output 'YES' because the first and last rows are not the same, but it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform in this case.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible grid configurations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
