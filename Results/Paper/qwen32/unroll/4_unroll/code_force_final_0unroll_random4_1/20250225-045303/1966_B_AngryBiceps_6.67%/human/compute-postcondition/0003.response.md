Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each grid, it determines if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if the first column is uniform and different from the last column. If either condition is true, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.**
