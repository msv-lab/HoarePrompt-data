Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and a grid of `n` lines each containing `m` characters which are either 'W' or 'B'. The function returns the result for each test case based on the grid configuration.**
