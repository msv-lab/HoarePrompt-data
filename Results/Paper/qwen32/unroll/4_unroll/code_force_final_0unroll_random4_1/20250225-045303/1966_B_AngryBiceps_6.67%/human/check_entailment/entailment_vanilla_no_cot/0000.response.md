To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to decide if all squares in the grid can be made the same color using the described operations.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Rows and Columns**: If all squares in the grid can be made the same color, then there must be at least one row or one column where all squares are the same color. This is because the operation only affects subrectangles, and if we can find a completely uniform row or column, we can use it to propagate its color throughout the grid.

2. **Checking Rows and Columns**: The code checks if the first row or the first column is uniform and compares it with the last row or last column. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that all squares can be made the same color. We need to ensure that there is at least one uniform row or column anywhere in the grid.

### Flaw in the Code:
The code only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns. This is insufficient because there could be a uniform row or column in the middle of the grid that the code does not consider.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Uniform Row Check**: Iterate through each row and check if all elements in the row are the same.
2. **Uniform Column Check**: Iterate through each column and check if all elements in the column are the same.
3. **Decision**: If there is at least one uniform row or one uniform column, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible rows and columns for uniformity.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
