The `print` statement will output a question mark followed by the values of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. According to the initial state, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers that satisfy the condition \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), where \(n\) is the length of a secret permutation `p`. The exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, but they are known to be within the range from 0 to \(n-1\).

Therefore, the output will be a question mark followed by these four integers.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)**
