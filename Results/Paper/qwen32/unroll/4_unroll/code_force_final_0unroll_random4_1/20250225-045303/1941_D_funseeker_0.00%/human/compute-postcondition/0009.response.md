To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to understand the values and transformations applied to the set `ans` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Function `func_3()`**: This function returns three values, which are assigned to `n`, `m`, and `x` respectively.
2. **Set `ans`**: This set is formed through a loop transformation, and the presence of `0` in `ans` affects its final state:
   - If `0` is present in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set.
   - If `0` is not present in `ans`, the set remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n`, `m`, and `x`**:
   - `n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`.
   - `m` is the second value returned by `func_3()`.
   - `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`.

2. **Set `ans`**:
   - Let's assume `ans` is initially formed from some loop transformations. The exact values in `ans` before the condition check are not provided, but we know the condition affects its final state.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, no changes are made.

### Output Analysis:
- **Case 1: `0` is in `ans`**:
  - `0` is removed from `ans`.
  - `n` is added to `ans`.
  - The final set `ans` will not contain `0` but will contain `n` along with any other elements that were in `ans` initially (except `0`).

- **Case 2: `0` is not in `ans`**:
  - No changes are made to `ans`.
  - The final set `ans` remains the same as it was after the loop transformations.

Since the exact values in `ans` before the condition check are not provided, we can't specify the exact numerical values printed. However, we can describe the final state of `ans` based on the given condition.

### Final Output Description:
- If `0` was in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added.
- If `0` was not in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output: **ans (where ans is the set of values resulting from the loop transformations with 0 removed and including n if 0 was in ans, otherwise ans remains unchanged)**
