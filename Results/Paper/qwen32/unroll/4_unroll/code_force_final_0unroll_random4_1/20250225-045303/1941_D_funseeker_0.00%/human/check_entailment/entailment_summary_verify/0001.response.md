### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` players standing in a circle.
- The ball starts with player `x`.
- There are `m` throws, and each throw has a distance `r_i` and a direction `c_i` which can be clockwise ('0'), counterclockwise ('1'), or unknown ('?').
- We need to determine which players could have the ball after `m` throws.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads `r` and `c`.

2. **Processing Throws**:
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it processes the set of possible positions `ans`:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position resulting from a clockwise throw to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position resulting from a counterclockwise throw to the temporary set `temp`.
   - Updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `0` is in the set `ans` (which can happen due to modulo operation), it is replaced with `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and their numbers in increasing order.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_4` determines the set of players who could be the last to throw an object after a series of throws, given the number of players, the number of throws, and the starting player. It prints the number of such players and their identifiers.

#### Verification:
- **Correctness of Set Usage**: The use of a set to track possible positions is correct. Sets inherently handle duplicates, ensuring each player is only counted once.
- **Direction Handling**: The code correctly handles both known and unknown directions by updating the set accordingly.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation correctly wraps around the circle. Handling the case where the result is `0` by converting it to `n` is correct.
- **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem's requirements.

#### Example Validation:
- **First Test Case**: With `n=6`, `m=3`, and `x=2`, and all throws being unknown, the possible positions after three throws are correctly calculated as `{2, 4, 6}`.
- **Second Test Case**: With `n=12`, `m=1`, and `x=2`, and a known clockwise throw of distance `3`, the result is correctly `11`.
- **Third Test Case**: With `n=10`, `m=7`, and `x=4`, and a mix of known and unknown throws, the possible positions are `{3, 5, 7, 9}`.
- **Fourth Test Case**: With `n=5`, `m=3`, and `x=1`, and a mix of known and unknown throws, the possible positions are `{2, 3, 5}`.
- **Fifth Test Case**: With `n=4`, `m=1`, and `x=1`, and an unknown throw, the result is correctly `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, handling all edge cases and producing the correct output format.

**Final: True**
