t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. Each of the next m lines contains an integer r_i such that 1 <= r_i <= n - 1, and a character c_i which is either '0', '1', or '?'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
