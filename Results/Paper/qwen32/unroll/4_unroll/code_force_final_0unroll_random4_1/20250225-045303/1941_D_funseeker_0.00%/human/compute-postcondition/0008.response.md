To determine the output of the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Function `func_3()`**: This function returns three values, which are assigned to `n`, `m`, and `x` respectively.
2. **Set `ans`**: This set is constructed based on the results of some loop transformations. If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set. If `0` is not in the set, `ans` remains as it is after the loop transformations.

### Detailed Breakdown:
- The exact values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not provided, but we know they are the results of `func_3()`.
- The set `ans` is influenced by the presence of `0` in the set:
  - If `0` is present in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added.
  - If `0` is not present in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Determining the Length of `ans`:
- The length of `ans` depends on the number of elements in the set after the transformations.
- Without the exact initial contents of `ans` and the specific values returned by `func_3()`, we cannot determine the exact numerical length of `ans`.
- However, we can describe the length based on the conditions given.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `0` is in `ans`**:
   - `0` is removed.
   - `n` is added.
   - The net effect on the length of `ans` depends on whether `n` was already in the set or not.
     - If `n` was not in the set, the length remains the same.
     - If `n` was in the set, the length remains the same because removing `0` and adding `n` (which is already there) does not change the length.

2. **If `0` is not in `ans`**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - The length of `ans` is simply the number of elements in the set after the loop transformations.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact contents of `ans` before the transformations and the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical length of `ans`. However, we can describe the length based on the conditions given.

Output: **len(ans) (where ans is the set resulting from the loop transformations with 0 removed and n added if 0 was in the set, otherwise ans remains the set from the loop transformations)**
