### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x` using `func_3()`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1()`.

2. **Processing Throws**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it processes the set of possible positions `ans`:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position resulting from a clockwise throw to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position resulting from a counterclockwise throw to the temporary set `temp`.
   - It then updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `0` is in the set `ans` (which can happen due to modulo operation), it is replaced with `n` to ensure the player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and their numbers in increasing order.

### Annotations Validation:

- **Initialization**: The set `ans` is initialized correctly with the starting player `x`.
- **Loop Processing**:
  - For each throw, the program correctly processes both known and unknown directions.
  - The use of modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around correctly within the circle.
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where the modulo operation results in `0` by replacing it with `n`.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the problem's requirements and constraints:
  - It uses a set to efficiently track all possible positions of the ball after each throw.
  - It correctly processes both known and unknown throw directions.
  - It handles the edge case where the modulo operation might result in `0` by converting it to `n`.
  - It outputs the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example. The annotations provide a clear and accurate description of the program's behavior, and there are no identified issues with the logic or implementation.

**Final: True**
