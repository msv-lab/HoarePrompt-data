### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a line from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem's requirements for reading input.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calls `func_1` and converts the result to an integer. It is used to read the number of test cases, which is a single integer. This is correctly implemented.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads a line from the input, splits it into substrings, and converts each substring to an integer. It is used to read the values `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case. This is correctly implemented.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function performs the main logic of the problem:
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction `c`, it updates the set `ans` by adding the positions that the ball could be in after the throw:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds `(q + r) % n` to the set.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - After all throws, it checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and corrects it to `n` if necessary (since player numbers are from 1 to `n`).
   - Finally, it prints the number of players who could have the ball and their identifiers in increasing order.

The logic for handling the throws and updating the set of possible players is correctly implemented. The use of sets ensures that each player is only counted once, and the final output is correctly formatted.

### Correctness:

Based on the analysis, all functions together meet the problem description and correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
