The code snippet assigns the variable `ans` the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This change affects the variable `ans`, but it does not change the values of any other variables provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`; `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` and all subsequent elements in `c` up to `c[n-1]`; `ans` is `float('inf')`.**
