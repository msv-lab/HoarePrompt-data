The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in lists `a` and `b`), `k` (an integer), and two lists `a` and `b` (each containing `n` integers). It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` from index `i` to the end of the list.
