The `details` list is sorted in place. Since `details` contains tuples of the form `(balance, -i, char)`, the sorting will primarily be based on the `balance` value. If two tuples have the same `balance`, the sorting will be based on the `-i` value, which means the tuple with the larger index (smaller `-i`) will come first. The `char` value does not affect the sorting order.

Given the initial state, `details` contains tuples for each character in the string `s` with the balance and negative index. After sorting, the order of these tuples will change based on the sorting criteria mentioned above.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a sorted list of tuples (balance, -i, char) for each character in the string `s`, primarily sorted by balance and secondarily by the negative index.**
