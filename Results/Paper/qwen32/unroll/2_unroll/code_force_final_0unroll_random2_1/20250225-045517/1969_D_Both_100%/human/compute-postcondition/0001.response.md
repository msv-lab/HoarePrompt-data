The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables mentioned in the state (heap, remaining_items, n, k, prices, neg_prices, bonuses, max_profit, current_profit, combined) are not directly related to the execution of this specific for loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`heap` is a list that will be used as a min-heap, `remaining_items` is an initially empty list, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `prices` is a list of n integers representing the prices for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of n integers representing the negative prices for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of n integers representing the bonuses for Bob, `max_profit` is initialized to 0, `current_profit` is initialized to 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and `combined` is sorted by the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
