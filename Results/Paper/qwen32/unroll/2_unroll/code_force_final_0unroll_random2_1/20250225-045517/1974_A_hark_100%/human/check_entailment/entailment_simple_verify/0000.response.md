### Reasoning:

1. **Function Call Before Definition**:
   - The original code does indeed call `func_1()` before it is defined. This will result in a `NameError` at runtime. This is a clear mistake and needs to be corrected.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens is flawed. The program incorrectly adjusts the value of `x` and calculates `bxsfory1` in a way that does not accurately reflect the number of screens needed.
   - The correct approach is to place as many 2x2 icons as possible first and then use the remaining space for 1x1 icons. The original program does not handle this correctly.

3. **Handling of Space on the Screen**:
   - Each screen has 15 cells. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell. The program should first place the 2x2 icons and then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.
   - The original programâ€™s logic for calculating the remaining cells and the number of screens needed is incorrect. For example, with input `7 2`, the output should be `1`, but the program might output `2` due to incorrect calculations.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Input**: `1 1 1`
  - **Expected Output**: `1`
  - **Program Output**: `1` (This might seem correct at first glance, but it is not a robust test case.)

- **Input**: `1 7 2`
  - **Expected Output**: `1`
  - **Program Output**: `1` (Incorrect, the correct output should be `2`)

### Corrected Version:

The corrected version of the program, as provided in the original assessment, correctly handles the placement of 2x2 and 1x1 icons and calculates the number of screens needed accurately.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the original program, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect. The function call before definition and the flawed logic for calculating the number of screens both contribute to the incorrectness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
