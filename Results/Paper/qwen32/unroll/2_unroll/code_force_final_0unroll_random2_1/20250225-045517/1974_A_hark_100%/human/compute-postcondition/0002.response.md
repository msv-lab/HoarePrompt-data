To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does with the given input values. The loop iterates `ap` times, and in each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `x` and `y`, performs some calculations, and prints a result based on the conditions provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's operations:

1. **Input Reading and Conditions:**
   - The loop reads two integers `x` and `y` in each iteration.
   - Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, different calculations are performed and a result is printed.

2. **Calculations and Output:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - Calculate `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`.
     - Update `x` as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
     - Calculate `bxsfory1` as 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise as the ceiling of `x / 15`.
     - Print the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
     - Print the ceiling of `y / 2`.
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
     - Print the ceiling of `x / 15`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - Print 0.

Since the loop does not modify the variables `t`, `x`, and `y` outside of its iterations, and it only prints results, the final state of `t`, `x`, and `y` after the loop will be the same as their initial state. The only change is that the loop will have printed results for each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `ap` is an input integer.

The output state will be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `x` and `y` remain the same as they were before the loop started.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and ap is an input integer.**
