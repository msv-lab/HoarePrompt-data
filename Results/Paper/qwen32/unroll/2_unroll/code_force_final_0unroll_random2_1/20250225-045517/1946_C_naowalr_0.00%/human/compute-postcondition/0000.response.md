The code snippet provided reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This operation does not affect the variables `n`, `k`, or `adj`, which are described in the initial state. The variable `t` is newly introduced and will hold the integer value read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree where each sublist contains the vertices adjacent to the vertex corresponding to the index of the list; `t` is an integer read from the standard input.**
