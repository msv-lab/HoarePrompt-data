Correctness: **False**

The provided program only handles the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. It does not correctly handle the general case for `n` up to 20 as specified in the problem description. For `n` values greater than 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the appropriate checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the program is not correct for all valid inputs.
