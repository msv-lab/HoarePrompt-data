Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only handles specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any value of \( n \) greater than 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct \( 2n \times 2n \) checkerboard pattern. This means the program does not handle all possible inputs within the specified range of \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
