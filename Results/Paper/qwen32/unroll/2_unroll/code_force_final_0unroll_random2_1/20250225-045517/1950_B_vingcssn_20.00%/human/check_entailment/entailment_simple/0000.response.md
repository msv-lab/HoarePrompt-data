Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to handle up to four specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) and prints the corresponding checkerboard patterns directly. However, the problem statement specifies that n can be any integer from 1 to 20. The program does not handle cases where n is greater than 4, as it outputs "No esta en el rango" for those values. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all possible inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
