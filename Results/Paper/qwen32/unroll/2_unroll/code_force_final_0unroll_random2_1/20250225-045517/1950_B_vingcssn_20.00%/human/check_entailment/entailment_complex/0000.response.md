### Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires printing a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern. The pattern consists of 2x2 blocks of '#' and '.', starting with '#' in the top-left corner. The program correctly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 by explicitly printing the expected patterns. However, the program does not handle cases where n is greater than 4. Instead, it prints 'No esta en el rango' (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish) for any n greater than 4.

Since the problem description specifies that n can be as large as 20, the program is incomplete and incorrect for values of n greater than 4. The program should generate the pattern dynamically for any valid n within the specified range.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description. It only correctly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and fails to handle cases for n > 4.
