Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given description. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program attempts to count the occurrences of each card and then divides by 3 to determine the score. This logic does not align with the game rules. According to the problem, you score a point only if the card you play already exists on the table. The provided program does not simulate the game turns or keep track of the cards on the table.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The sum of `elements.count(item) // 3` does not provide the correct score. The score should be determined based on the optimal play strategy described in the problem, where each player tries to maximize their score while minimizing the opponent's score.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**: The program does not implement any strategy to simulate the optimal play as described for both players. It simply counts the occurrences of each card and performs an incorrect calculation, which is unrelated to the game's rules.

To solve the problem correctly, the program would need to simulate the game turns, keep track of the cards on the table, and implement the optimal play strategy for both players.
