Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted array and prints that count. This does not address the problem of increasing the median with the minimum number of operations.

To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median.
3. Determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase this median. This involves incrementing elements in such a way that the median increases, which typically means increasing the smallest elements around the median position until the median value itself increases.

The provided code does not perform these steps. Instead, it just counts how many times the median element appears, which is unrelated to the number of operations needed to increase the median.

Correctness: **False**
