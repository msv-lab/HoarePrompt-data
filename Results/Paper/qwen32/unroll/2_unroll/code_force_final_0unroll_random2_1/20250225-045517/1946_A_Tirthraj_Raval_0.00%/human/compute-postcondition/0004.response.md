Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `t` is the number of test cases, for each test case, it returns the sum of the integers in the list `a`.**
