Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which does not represent any meaningful cost.
   - The line `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is trying to adjust the cost based on the number of tickets bought, but the subtraction of `s * s / 2` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Buying Tickets**:
   - The code attempts to buy `min(m, k)` tickets each day, but it doesn't correctly manage the remaining tickets (`k`) or the increasing prices.
   - The logic does not account for the fact that buying tickets on a day increases the prices for subsequent days.

3. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The code sorts the list of prices, which is a good start, but it does not correctly use the sorted list to minimize the total cost while considering the constraints.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you should use a greedy approach where you buy the cheapest available tickets each day, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day and the price increase mechanism.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prices.sort()
        total_cost = 0
        increase = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            if k == 0:
                break
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * (price + increase)
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            increase += tickets_to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Explanation of Correct Code:

1. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The prices are sorted in ascending order to buy the cheapest tickets first.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - For each day, buy the maximum number of tickets allowed (`m`) or the remaining tickets needed (`k`), whichever is smaller.
   - Add the cost of the tickets to the total cost, considering the current price increase.
   - Decrease the number of remaining tickets (`k`) by the number of tickets bought.
   - Increase the price for subsequent days by the number of tickets bought.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when all tickets (`k`) are bought.

This approach ensures that the total cost is minimized while adhering to the constraints.
