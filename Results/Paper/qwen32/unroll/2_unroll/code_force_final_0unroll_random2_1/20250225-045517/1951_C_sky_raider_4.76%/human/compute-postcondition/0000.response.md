In the given for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `i` and the function `input()`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `input()`, which is expected to be an integer representing the number of iterations (`t` in this context).

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we need to ensure that the input function returns this value `t` so that the loop can execute the correct number of times.

Since the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `i`, and `i` is initialized by the range function based on the input, we don't need to adjust `i` directly. Instead, we need to make sure that the input function returns the correct value of `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input function returns `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input function must return `t`**.
