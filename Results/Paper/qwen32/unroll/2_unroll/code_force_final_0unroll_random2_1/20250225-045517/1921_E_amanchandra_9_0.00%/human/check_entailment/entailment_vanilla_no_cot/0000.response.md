Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game based on the provided problem description. The logic for determining the winner is flawed, particularly in how it calculates the possible moves and the conditions for winning or drawing.

Let's break down the issues in the provided program:

1. **Immediate Winning Condition**: The program does not check if Alice or Bob can immediately win on their first move. For example, if Alice is at (x_a, y_a) and Bob is at (x_a + 1, y_a), Alice should win on her first move.

2. **Draw Condition**: The program incorrectly determines when a draw occurs. A draw should occur when neither player can make a move or when both players are stuck and cannot reach each other's position.

3. **Move Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of moves each player can make towards each other but does not correctly account for the possible diagonal moves and the constraints on the board.

4. **Logical Errors**: The logical conditions for determining the winner or a draw are incorrect and do not accurately reflect the game rules.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Immediate win checks
        if xa + 1 == xb and ya == yb:
            print("Alice")
            continue
        if xb - 1 == xa and ya == yb:
            print("Bob")
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of moves Alice and Bob can make
        alice_moves = h - xa
        bob_moves = xb - 1
        
        # If Alice can reach Bob's row before Bob can reach Alice's row
        if alice_moves > bob_moves:
            print("Alice")
        elif bob_moves > alice_moves:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            # If they can reach each other's row in the same number of moves
            # Check if Alice can reach Bob's column before Bob can reach Alice's column
            if abs(ya - yb) <= alice_moves:
                print("Alice")
            elif abs(ya - yb) <= bob_moves:
                print("Bob")
            else:
                print("Draw")

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the immediate winning conditions, calculates the number of moves each player can make, and determines the winner or draw based on the game rules.
