Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape composed of '1's in the grid is a triangle or a square. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the number of '1's in each row and makes a decision based on that, which is not sufficient to distinguish between a triangle and a square.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. The program sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1'. However, a triangle can have multiple rows with exactly one '1' (e.g., the top and bottom rows of an upside-down triangle), but this alone does not confirm that the shape is a triangle.
2. The program sets `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row has more than one '1'. However, this condition is true for both squares and triangles, so it does not correctly identify a square.
3. The program does not check the specific arrangement of '1's in the rows, which is necessary to determine the shape.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
001
010
100
```
This grid has rows with exactly one '1', but it does not form a triangle. The program would incorrectly classify it as a triangle.

Another example:
```
11
11
```
This grid has rows with more than one '1', but it forms a square. The program would correctly classify it as a square, but this is not due to the correct logic but rather due to the fact that the grid is a square.

To correctly determine the shape, the program needs to check the specific pattern of '1's in the grid, such as ensuring that the number of '1's in each row forms a sequence that matches the pattern of a triangle or a square.

Correctness: **False**
