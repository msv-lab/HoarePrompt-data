Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the given problem description. Here are several issues with the code:

1. **Detection of Triangle and Square**:
   - The program checks if there is a row with exactly one '1' to determine the shape as a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to confirm the presence of a triangle as defined in the problem statement. A triangle must have consecutive rows with an increasing or decreasing number of '1's centered around a single column.
   - The program checks if there is a row with more than one '1' to determine the shape as a square. This is also not sufficient to confirm the presence of a square as defined in the problem statement. A square must have consecutive rows with the same number of '1's aligned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases but does not correctly reset or reinitialize variables (`a` and `b`) for each test case. This can lead to incorrect results if the variables retain values from previous test cases.

3. **Inconsistent Output**:
   - The program uses inconsistent logic for determining and printing the shape. For example, if a row with exactly one '1' is found, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. However, it does not handle the case where multiple rows with different numbers of '1's might indicate a triangle. Similarly, it sets `b` to 'SQUARE' if a row with more than one '1' is found, but this does not confirm a square.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the grid might contain a triangle or square that does not start from the first row or is not perfectly aligned with the left edge of the grid.

Here is an example where the program would fail:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```
In this case, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because it finds rows with more than one '1' without checking the specific pattern required for a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
