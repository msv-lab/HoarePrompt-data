grid is a list of lists of characters ('0' or '1'), where each inner list has the same length as the number of inner lists (i.e., grid is a square matrix). The length of grid (n) satisfies 2 <= n <= 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
