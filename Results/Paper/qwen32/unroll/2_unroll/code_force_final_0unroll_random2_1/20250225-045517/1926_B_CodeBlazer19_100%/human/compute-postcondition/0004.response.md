Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of '0's and '1's. For each grid, it determines whether the grid contains a shape composed entirely of '1's that forms a triangle or a square, and then prints the type of shape ("TRIANGLE" or "SQUARE") for each test case.**
