You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the given problem description. Here are several issues with the code:

1. **Detection of Triangle and Square**:
   - The program checks if there is a row with exactly one '1' to determine the shape as a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to confirm the presence of a triangle as defined in the problem statement. A triangle must have consecutive rows with an increasing or decreasing number of '1's centered around a single column.
   - The program checks if there is a row with more than one '1' to determine the shape as a square. This is also not sufficient to confirm the presence of a square as defined in the problem statement. A square must have consecutive rows with the same number of '1's aligned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases but does not correctly reset or reinitialize variables (`a` and `b`) for each test case. This can lead to incorrect results if the variables retain values from previous test cases.

3. **Inconsistent Output**:
   - The program uses inconsistent logic for determining and printing the shape. For example, if a row with exactly one '1' is found, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. However, it does not handle the case where multiple rows with different numbers of '1's might indicate a triangle. Similarly, it sets `b` to 'SQUARE' if a row with more than one '1' is found, but this does not confirm a square.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the grid might contain a triangle or square that does not start from the first row or is not perfectly aligned with the left edge of the grid.

Here is an example where the program would fail:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```
In this case, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because it finds rows with more than one '1' without checking the specific pattern required for a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
