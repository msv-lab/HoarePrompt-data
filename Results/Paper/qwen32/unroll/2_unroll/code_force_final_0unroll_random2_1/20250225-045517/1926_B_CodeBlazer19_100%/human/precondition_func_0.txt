The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. It is guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
