#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being either `'no'` or `'yes'`, depending on the conditions specified in the loop.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: results
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their respective facing directions ("U" for up and "D" for down). For each test case, it checks if the number of coins is odd and if there are more coins facing up than down. If both conditions are met, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".
