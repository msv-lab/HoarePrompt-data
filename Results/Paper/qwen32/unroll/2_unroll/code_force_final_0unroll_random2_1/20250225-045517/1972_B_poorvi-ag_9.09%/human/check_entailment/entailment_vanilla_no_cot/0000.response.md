Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and examples provided. The program incorrectly uses the parity of `n` and the counts of 'U' and 'D' to determine the winner, which does not align with the optimal play strategy described in the problem.

The correct strategy involves understanding that the game can be analyzed based on the number of 'U' coins and their positions, but the provided program oversimplifies this logic. Specifically, the program does not account for the correct conditions under which Alice or Bob can force a win.

A correct solution would involve more complex logic to simulate the game or analyze the game state, considering the positions of 'U' coins and the effects of each player's moves.
