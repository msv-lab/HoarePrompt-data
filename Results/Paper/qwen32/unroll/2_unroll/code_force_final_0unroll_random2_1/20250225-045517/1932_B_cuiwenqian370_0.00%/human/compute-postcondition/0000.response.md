Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the integers in `path` represent the periodicities of the signs, each being between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. `input` is a function that reads from standard input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This change does not affect the values of `path` or `n`, which remain as described in the initial state.
