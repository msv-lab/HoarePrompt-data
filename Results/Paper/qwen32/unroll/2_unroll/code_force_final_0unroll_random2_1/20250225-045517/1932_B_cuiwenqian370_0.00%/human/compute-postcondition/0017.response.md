Postcondition: **`path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path` with `n` greater than 1. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1`; otherwise, the first element of `dp` is `-float('inf')`. The second element of `dp` is `-float('inf')` if the second element of `path` is '*', otherwise it is `dp[0] + 1` if the second element of `path` is '@', or `dp[0]` if the second element of `path` is not '@'. The rest of `dp` remains a list of zeros.**
