The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables `path`, `n`, `data`, `t`, and `index`. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from `path`; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
