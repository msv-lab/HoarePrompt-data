The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, and `results` is an empty list. These do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted. The only requirement for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be initialized to 0 (though `i` is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range` function).

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
