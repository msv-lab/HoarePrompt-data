Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively; `M` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The list `q` remains unchanged as it contains tuples of integers representing Vasya's positions and numbers. The new variable `M` has been initialized as an empty list.
