Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

The `results` list contains a 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the `t` test cases, where each test case is defined by the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`. The specific 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case is determined by the conditions checked within the loop, but the exact conditions are not specified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the output is the `results` list with the outcomes for all test cases.
