### Reasoning:
The program's approach to solving the problem is based on set operations and logical checks to determine if it's possible to select \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Unique Elements Extraction**:
   - `unique_a` and `unique_b` are sets containing unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are subsets of `unique_a` and `unique_b` that only include elements that are less than or equal to \(k\).

2. **Categorizing Elements**:
   - `only_a` contains elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` contains elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
   - `both` contains elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Logical Checks**:
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than \(\frac{k}{2}\), it's impossible to select \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from `a` without exceeding the limit, so the result is 'NO'.
   - If the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than \(\frac{k}{2}\), it's impossible to select \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from `b` without exceeding the limit, so the result is 'NO'.
   - `total_distinct` is the total number of distinct elements from 1 to \(k\) that can be chosen from both arrays combined. If this is less than \(k\), it's impossible to choose elements such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included, so the result is 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the result is 'YES'.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the logic with the provided example test cases:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - `a = [2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5]`, `b = [1, 3, 4, 10, 5]`, `k = 6`
   - `unique_a = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}`, `unique_b = {1, 3, 4, 5, 10}`
   - `relevant_a = {2, 3, 5, 6}`, `relevant_b = {1, 3, 4, 5}`
   - `only_a = {2, 6}`, `only_b = {1, 4}`, `both = {3, 5}`
   - `total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6`
   - Since `total_distinct` is equal to \(k\), the result is 'YES'.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `a = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5]`, `b = [1, 3, 8, 10, 3]`, `k = 6`
   - `unique_a = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, `unique_b = {1, 3, 8, 10}`
   - `relevant_a = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, `relevant_b = {1, 3}`
   - `only_a = {2, 4, 5, 6}`, `only_b = {1}`, `both = {3}`
   - `total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both) = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6`
   - However, `only_a` has 4 elements which is greater than \(\frac{k}{2}\) (which is 3), so the result is 'NO'.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `a = [1, 3, 5]`, `b = [2, 4, 6]`, `k = 4`
   - `unique_a = {1, 3, 5}`, `unique_b = {2, 4, 6}`
   - `relevant_a = {1, 3}`, `relevant_b = {2, 4}`
   - `only_a = {1, 3}`, `only_b = {2, 4}`, `both = {}`
   - `total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both) = 2 + 2 + 0 = 4`
   - Since `total_distinct` is equal to \(k\), the result is 'YES'.

The program correctly handles these test cases and adheres to the problem's requirements.
