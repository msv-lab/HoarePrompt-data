The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variables `data`, `index`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a component of the original input string split by whitespace; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the string at `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
