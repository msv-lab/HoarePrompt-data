t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the following k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} each, where 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, representing the order of participants shown in the screenshot posted by the participant a_{i0}. The author of each screenshot (a_{i0}) is always at the top of the list in their respective screenshot. All authors of the screenshots are different across all test cases.
