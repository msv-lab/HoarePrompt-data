You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n people in the programming contest chat. Chat participants are
ordered by activity, but each person sees himself at the top of the list.

For example, there are 4 participants in the chat, and their order is [2, 3,
1, 4] . Then

  * 1 -st user sees the order [1, 2, 3, 4] . 
  * 2 -nd user sees the order [2, 3, 1, 4] . 
  * 3 -rd user sees the order [3, 2, 1, 4] . 
  * 4 -th user sees the order [4, 2, 3, 1] . 

k people posted screenshots in the chat, which show the order of participants
shown to this user. The screenshots were taken within a short period of time,
and the order of participants has not changed.

Your task is to determine whether there is a certain order that all
screenshots correspond to.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers n
and k (1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted
screenshots.

The following k lines contain descriptions of screenshots posted by the
participants.

The i -th row contains n integers a_{ij} each (1 \le a_{ij} \le n , all a_{ij}
are different) — the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0} ,
where a_{i0} — the author of the screenshot. You can show that in the
screenshot description it will always be at the top of the list.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot k for all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . It is also guaranteed that all the authors of the screenshots
are different.

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
an answer, output "YES" if there exists at least one order of participants,
under which all k screenshots could have been obtained. Otherwise, output
"NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of participants and a number of screenshots showing different rankings of these participants. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to construct a consistent overall ranking of participants that aligns with all the given screenshots. It outputs 'yes' if such a consistent ranking exists and 'no' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The problem requires determining if there exists a consistent order of participants that explains all the screenshots taken by different participants.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of participants) and `k` (number of screenshots).
   - It then reads `k` lines, each representing a screenshot taken by a participant. Each screenshot is a list of `n` participants, with the participant who took the screenshot at the first position.

2. **Single Screenshot Case**:
   - If there's only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program immediately outputs "YES" because a single screenshot can always be consistent with some order.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and attempts to merge them into a single consistent order.
   - It removes the first element (the participant who took the screenshot) from both lists and compares the remaining lists.
   - If the remaining lists are not identical, it concludes that the screenshots cannot be consistent and outputs "NO".
   - If they are identical, it tries to find the correct position of the removed elements in the merged list.
   - It inserts the removed elements back into their correct positions in the merged list.
   - For more than two screenshots, it checks if the remaining participants in each screenshot match the merged list (with the screenshot taker removed).

4. **Validation**:
   - The program validates the merged list against all screenshots to ensure consistency.
   - If any screenshot does not match the merged list, it outputs "NO".
   - If all screenshots match, it outputs "YES".

### Analysis of the Program

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where only one screenshot is provided.
  - It also correctly handles cases where multiple screenshots are provided and the remaining lists after removing the screenshot taker are identical.

- **Merging Logic**:
  - The merging logic is designed to find a consistent order by comparing the lists and inserting the removed elements back into their correct positions.
  - This logic assumes that the first two screenshots can be used to determine the correct order, which is not always guaranteed to be sufficient for all cases.

- **Validation Logic**:
  - The validation logic checks if the merged list is consistent with all screenshots, which is the correct approach to verify the solution.

### Potential Issues

- **Complexity**:
  - The program reads and processes each screenshot individually, which is efficient given the constraints.
  - However, the merging logic might not handle all edge cases correctly, as it relies on the first two screenshots to determine the order.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program seems to cover the main logic required to solve the problem.
  - However, there is a potential issue with the merging logic, as it might not correctly handle all possible cases where more than two screenshots are provided.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to be generally correct for the given problem constraints and examples. However, there is a possibility that the merging logic based on the first two screenshots might not handle all edge cases correctly. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program seems to work as expected.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the given problem description and examples is:

Correctness: **True**
