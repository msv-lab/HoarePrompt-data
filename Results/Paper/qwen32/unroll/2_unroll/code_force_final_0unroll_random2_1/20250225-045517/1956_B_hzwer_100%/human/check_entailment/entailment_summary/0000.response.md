### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key to the problem lies in understanding that you score a point every time you play a card that has already been played by either player. Given that each card number from 1 to n appears at most twice, the maximum number of points you can score is equal to the number of duplicate cards you have, as each duplicate card can potentially be played after the first occurrence of that card, thus scoring a point.

The provided program correctly identifies the number of duplicates in the list of cards you have by counting the occurrences of each card number and summing the number of times each card appears more than once. This is exactly what is needed to determine the maximum number of points you can score.

The execution summary confirms that the function reads the input correctly and calculates the number of duplicate integers for each test case, which aligns with the problem's requirement.
