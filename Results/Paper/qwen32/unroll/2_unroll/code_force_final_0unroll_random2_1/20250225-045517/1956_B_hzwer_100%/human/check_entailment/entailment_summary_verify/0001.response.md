### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize your score by playing cards optimally.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Each card has a number from 1 to n.
   - Each number appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - Players take turns playing cards.
   - You score a point if the cardâ€™s number is already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Duplicates**:
   - It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each integer.

3. **Calculating Points**:
   - It calculates the score by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`.
   - This formula counts the number of pairs of cards you have, as each pair contributes 1 to your score.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the calculated score for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the number of duplicate integers in the list for each test case.

#### Evaluation:
- **Key Insight**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can achieve. Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- **Strategy**: The optimal strategy for you is to play cards such that you maximize the number of times you can play a card that has already been played. This means you should focus on playing pairs of cards you have.
- **Implementation**: The program correctly counts the number of pairs of cards you have and sums these to determine your maximum score. The formula `max(0, x - 1)` effectively counts the number of pairs for each integer `x` in your hand.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can achieve by counting the number of pairs of cards you have, which is the optimal strategy given Nene's optimal play.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
