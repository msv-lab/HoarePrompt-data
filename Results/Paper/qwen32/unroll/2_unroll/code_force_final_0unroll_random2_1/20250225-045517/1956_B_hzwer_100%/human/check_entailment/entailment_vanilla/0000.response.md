Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

- You and Nene each have `n` cards.
- Cards are numbered from 1 to `n`, with each number appearing exactly twice.
- Players take turns, placing one card each turn.
- You score a point if the card you place has already been placed on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Key Observations:
1. **Your Strategy**: You should aim to play cards that have already been placed on the table to score points.
2. **Nene's Strategy**: Nene will play optimally to prevent you from scoring points whenever possible. She will play cards that have not yet been placed to avoid giving you points, and if she has to play a card that has been placed, she will do so in a way that minimizes your score.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to determine the maximum number of points you can score by counting the number of cards you have that appear more than once. Here's the logic:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The solution counts the occurrences of each card number in your hand using an array `cnt`, where `cnt[i]` represents the number of times card `i` appears in your hand.
2. **Calculating Points**: For each card number, if it appears more than once, you can score a point by playing the second occurrence of that card. Therefore, the solution sums up `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for each card number `i`.

### Correctness:
The solution correctly identifies that you can score a point for each card number that appears more than once in your hand. This is because the second occurrence of a card will always score a point for you, assuming Nene plays optimally to minimize your score by not playing the same card before you can play it again.

However, the solution does not explicitly simulate the turns or account for Nene's strategy in detail. Instead, it relies on the fact that the optimal strategy for both players results in you scoring a point for each card that appears more than once in your hand.

### Conclusion:
The solution is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score based on the given constraints and the optimal strategies of both players.

**Correctness: True**
