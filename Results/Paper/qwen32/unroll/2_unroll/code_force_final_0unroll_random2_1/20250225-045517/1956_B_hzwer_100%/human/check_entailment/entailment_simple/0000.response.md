### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the described card game, given that Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Card Occurrences**:
   - It creates a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer from 1 to `n` in your hand.
   - For each card `x` in your hand, it increments `cnt[x]`.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store your maximum possible points.
   - For each count `x` in `cnt` (excluding the 0th index), it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`. This step is critical:
     - If a card appears twice in your hand (`x == 2`), you can score 1 point by playing one of the cards and then the other (since Nene will play the other card optimally).
     - If a card appears only once (`x == 1`), you cannot score any points with this card.
     - If a card appears more than twice (which is not possible according to the problem constraints), it would be handled similarly, but the problem guarantees that each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum points you can score by focusing on the number of duplicate cards in your hand. Since Nene always plays optimally, she will ensure that she scores points whenever possible, but you can still score points if you have duplicate cards. The program correctly identifies these opportunities and calculates the maximum points accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.

**Correctness: True**
