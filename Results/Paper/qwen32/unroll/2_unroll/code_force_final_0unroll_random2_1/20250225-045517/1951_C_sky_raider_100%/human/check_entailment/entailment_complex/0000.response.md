### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets given a set of constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of days, the maximum tickets that can be bought per day, and the total tickets to be bought, respectively.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Sorting Prices**:
   - The list of ticket prices `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step to ensure that we buy tickets on the cheapest available days first, minimizing the total cost.

3. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes variables `t` (total tickets bought so far) and `c` (cumulative cost).
   - It iterates over each day, buying up to `m` tickets or the remaining `k` tickets (whichever is smaller) on that day.
   - The cost for the tickets bought on day `i` is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `s` is the number of tickets bought on that day, `l[i]` is the original price of a ticket on day `i`, and `t` is the number of tickets bought so far (which affects the price on subsequent days).
   - The total number of tickets bought so far `t` and the remaining tickets to be bought `k` are updated accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all days for a test case, the cumulative cost `c` is printed.

### Correctness:

The approach taken in the program is logically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements. By sorting the prices and buying tickets on the cheapest days first, the program ensures that the total cost is minimized. Additionally, the constraints are handled correctly, with the program buying up to `m` tickets per day and adjusting the prices for subsequent days.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
