Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` represents the number of sale days, `m` represents the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day, and `k` represents the total number of tickets to be bought. Additionally, it accepts a list of `n` integers `a` representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The function returns the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased each day.**
