The code provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `v`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_3()` and satisfy the condition \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and they satisfy \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is 1.**
