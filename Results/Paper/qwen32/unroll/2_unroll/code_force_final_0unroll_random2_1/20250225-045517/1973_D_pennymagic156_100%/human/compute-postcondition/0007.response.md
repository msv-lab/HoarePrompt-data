To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_2()` does. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine how it affects the variables `n`, `k`, and `v`. Without knowing the implementation of `func_2()`, we can only assume that it might modify one or more of the variables `n`, `k`, or `v`, or it might not modify them at all.

Since there is no specific information about the function `func_2()`, the safest assumption is that the variables `n`, `k`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `v`**.
