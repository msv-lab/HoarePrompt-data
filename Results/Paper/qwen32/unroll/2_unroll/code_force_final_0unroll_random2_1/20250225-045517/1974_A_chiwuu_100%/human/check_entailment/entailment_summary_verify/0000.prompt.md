You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. It calculates and prints the total number of 2x2 icons needed to accommodate both types of icons, ensuring that the total area covered by the icons is minimized.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

Let's break down the logic and see if it correctly handles the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `a` and 2x2 icons `b`.

2. **Handling 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (the number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and we need half the number of screens as 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is set to `b // 2 + 1` (since an odd number of 2x2 icons means we need an additional screen).

3. **Handling Remaining Cells with 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons (since each screen has 15 cells and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the number of screens `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1` (the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed).
   - The number of additional screens needed for `t2` 1x1 icons is added to `t`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` screens are added. Otherwise, `t2 // 15 + 1` screens are added.

Let's consider a few test cases to verify the logic:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells. One 1x1 icon can fit in those 11 cells.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `7 2`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells. Seven 1x1 icons can fit in those 7 cells.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `12 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Four 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, which means we need 2 screens. After placing the 2x2 icons, we have 14 cells left, which can fit 12 1x1 icons.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `0 3`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Three 2x2 icons require 2 screens.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1 0`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: One 1x1 icon requires 1 screen.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `8 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells. Eight 1x1 icons can fit in those 11 cells.

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No icons require 0 screens.

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `2 0`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Two 1x1 icons require 1 screen.

- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `15 0`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Fifteen 1x1 icons require 1 screen.

- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `8 2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells. Eight 1x1 icons can fit in those 7 cells, but we need an additional screen.

- **Test Case 11:**
  - Input: `0 9`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: Nine 2x2 icons require 5 screens.

Upon reviewing the logic and test cases, it seems that the program handles the problem requirements correctly for all the provided examples. However, let's consider edge cases:

- **Edge Case 1:**
  - Input: `15 0`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Fifteen 1x1 icons fit exactly in one screen.

- **Edge Case 2:**
  - Input: `0 9`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: Nine 2x2 icons require 5 screens.

- **Edge Case 3:**
  - Input: `16 0`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Sixteen 1x1 icons require two screens.

Based on the analysis, the program seems to handle all the edge cases and test cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
