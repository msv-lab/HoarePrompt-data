The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once given the constraints.

Since `t` is already provided and within the required range, no adjustment to `t` is necessary for the loop to execute. The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the problem description but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted according to the task constraints.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
