### Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more prefix-suffix swaps. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all`. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the array is already sorted, and the function prints "YES".

2. **Prefix-Suffix Swap Check**:
   - If the array is not already sorted, the function iterates through the array to find the first instance where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
   - Once such an instance is found, it creates a new list `new` which is the suffix of the array starting from index `i`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: All elements in the new list `new` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original array `a[0]`.
     - `new_all`: The new list `new` itself should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition fails, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program only checks for a single split point and does not consider all possible splits. Specifically, it only checks the first point where the array is not sorted and does not explore other possible splits that could make the array non-decreasing.
- The logic for checking the conditions after the split is flawed. The condition `check_all_new` checks if all elements in the new list are less than or equal to the first element of the original array, but this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted by a single prefix-suffix swap.
- The program should consider all possible splits and check if any of them result in a non-decreasing array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations. It only checks one specific split point and does not explore other possibilities.

**Correctness: False**
