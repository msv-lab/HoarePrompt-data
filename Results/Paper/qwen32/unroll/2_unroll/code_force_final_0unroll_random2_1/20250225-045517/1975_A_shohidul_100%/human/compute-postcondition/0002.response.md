Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each either 'YES' or 'NO', corresponding to each test case. For each test case, 'YES' is printed if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing a prefix of elements such that the remaining list is non-decreasing and the first element of the original list is greater than or equal to all elements of the new list. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
