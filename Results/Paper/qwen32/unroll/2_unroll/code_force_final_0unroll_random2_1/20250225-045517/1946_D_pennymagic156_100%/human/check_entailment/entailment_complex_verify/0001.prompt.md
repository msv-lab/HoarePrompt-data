You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Find the maximum number `k` such that we can split the array `a` into `k` segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` satisfying the following conditions:
   - `l_1 = 1`
   - `r_k = n`
   - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i`
   - `r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}` for all `i` from `1` to `k-1`
   - The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Constraints**:
   - Number of test cases `t` up to `10^4`
   - Length of array `n` up to `10^5`
   - Each element of `a` and `x` is less than `2^{30}`

### Analysis of the Program:
The program provided is designed to solve the problem using bitwise operations. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the approach taken by the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a single integer from input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a line of input and returns a map of integers (used to read `n` and `x`).
   - `func_4()`: Reads a line of input and returns it as a string (not used in the provided code).

2. **Main Logic (`func_5()`)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `t`: A list to store intermediate results.
     - `ans`: The maximum number of segments found, initialized to `-1`.
   - **Iterate over each bit position (from 29 to 0)**:
     - `u`: The `i`-th bit of `x`.
     - `v`: The sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
     - **Conditions**:
       - If both `u` and `v` are `0`, continue to the next bit.
       - If `u` is `0` and `v` is odd, return `ans` immediately (impossible to split).
       - If `u` is `0` and `v` is even, process the array to find segments where the `i`-th bit XOR is `0`.
       - If `u` is `1` and `v` is odd, continue to the next bit (impossible to split).
       - If `u` is `1` and `v` is even and non-zero, count the maximum number of segments where the `i`-th bit XOR is `0`.
       - If `u` is `1` and `v` is zero, break the loop (no more bits to process).
   - **Final Step**:
     - Return the maximum of `ans` and the length of `a` (in case no valid segments are found, the whole array is considered a segment).

### Correctness Check:
- The program iterates over each bit position and checks the conditions based on the problem statement. It correctly handles the cases where it's impossible to split the array and where the whole array can be considered a segment.
- The logic for counting segments where the `i`-th bit XOR is `0` is correct and ensures that the segments are valid.
- The final result is the maximum number of segments found or the length of the array if no valid segments are found.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
