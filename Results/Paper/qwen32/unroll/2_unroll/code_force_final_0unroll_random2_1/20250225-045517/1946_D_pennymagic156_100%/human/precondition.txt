Each test case consists of two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ x < 2^{30}) representing the length of the array and the favorite number respectively, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}) representing the array itself. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
