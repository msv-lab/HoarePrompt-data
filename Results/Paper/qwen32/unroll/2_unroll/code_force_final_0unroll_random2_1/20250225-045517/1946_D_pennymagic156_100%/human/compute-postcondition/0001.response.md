Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30 returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list returned by `func_1()`**

Explanation: The variable `a` is reassigned to the list returned by `func_1()`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the execution of `func_1()`.
