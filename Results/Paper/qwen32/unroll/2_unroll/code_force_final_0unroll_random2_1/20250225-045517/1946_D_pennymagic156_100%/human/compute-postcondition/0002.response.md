The code snippet initializes two new variables `t` and `ans`. The variable `t` is initialized as an empty list, and `ans` is initialized as -1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30 returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.**
