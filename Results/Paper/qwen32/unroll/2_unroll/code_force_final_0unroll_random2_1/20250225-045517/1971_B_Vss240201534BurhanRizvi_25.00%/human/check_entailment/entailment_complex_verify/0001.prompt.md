You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, the output is either "No" if the string s is the same as its random permutation s2, or "Yes" followed by the permuted string s2. The value of t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if a random permutation of the string `s` is different from `s` itself. If they are different, it outputs "Yes" followed by the permuted string; otherwise, it outputs "No". The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by randomly rearranging the characters of the input string `s` and checking if the rearranged string `s2` is different from the original string `s`. If a different arrangement is found, it outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string. If the rearranged string is the same as the original string, it outputs "NO".

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Randomness and Efficiency**: The program relies on randomness to find a different arrangement, which is not efficient and may not guarantee a correct solution in a reasonable amount of time, especially for strings with many repeated characters (e.g., "aaaaa").

2. **Guaranteed Different Arrangement**: The problem requires a guaranteed solution if one exists. Relying on randomness does not provide this guarantee. For example, if the input string consists of all identical characters (like "aaaaa"), no rearrangement can produce a different string, and the program should correctly identify this case. However, due to the nature of randomness, the program might incorrectly output "YES" and a rearranged string that is identical to the original one, or it might take a very long time to find a different arrangement.

3. **Deterministic Solution**: A more reliable and deterministic approach would be to systematically rearrange the string. For example, you could swap the first two characters if the string length is greater than 1, or identify a character that can be moved to a different position to ensure the string is different.

### Conclusion:

Given these points, the program does not guarantee a correct solution in all cases due to its reliance on randomness. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
