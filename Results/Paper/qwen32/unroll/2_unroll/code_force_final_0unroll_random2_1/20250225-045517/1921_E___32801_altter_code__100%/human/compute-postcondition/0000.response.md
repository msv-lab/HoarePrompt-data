The given code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `r`. The initial state describes `t` test cases, each with six integers, but the provided code only reads one line of input and does not process multiple test cases.

Given that the input is a single line of integers, the variable `r` will be a list of integers corresponding to that line of input. The other variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `r` is a list of integers corresponding to the single line of input; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state.**
