Let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables and conditions before we determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`t`**: This is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, i.e., `t = abs(y2 - y1)`.
2. **`r`**: This is a list of integers.
   - `n = r[0]`
   - `m = r[1]`
   - `x1` is calculated based on the condition:
     - If `y1 > y2`, then `x1 = r[2] + y2`
     - Otherwise, `x1 = r[2] + 1 + m - y2`
   - `y1` is calculated based on the condition:
     - If `y2 > r[3] + 1`, then `y1 = r[3] + 1`
     - Otherwise, `y1 = r[3] - 1`
3. **`x2`**: This is adjusted by subtracting `a` from it, i.e., `x2 = x2 - a`.
4. **`y2`**: This is adjusted based on the condition:
   - If `y2 <= y1`, then `y2 = 1`
   - Otherwise, `y2 = m`
5. **`a`**: This is calculated based on the condition:
   - If `y2 <= y1`, then `a = 0`
   - Otherwise, `a = m - y2`
6. **`b`**: This is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, i.e., `b = x2 - x1`, which is an even positive integer.
7. **`c`**: This is calculated based on the condition:
   - If `y2 <= y1`, then `c = y1 - 1`
   - Otherwise, `c = r[1] - (r[3] - 1)`
8. **Additional Conditions**:
   - `x2 > x1`
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m` or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement

The print statement is:
```python
print('draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables. The conditions and calculations in the initial state do not affect the content of the print statement.

### Final Output

Output: **draw**
