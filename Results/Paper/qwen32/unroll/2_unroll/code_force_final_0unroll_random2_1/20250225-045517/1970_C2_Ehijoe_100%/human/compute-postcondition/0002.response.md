The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `empty` to `True`. No other variables are modified, and no operations are performed that would affect the existing state of `nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, or `edges`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `1 <= start <= n`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**
