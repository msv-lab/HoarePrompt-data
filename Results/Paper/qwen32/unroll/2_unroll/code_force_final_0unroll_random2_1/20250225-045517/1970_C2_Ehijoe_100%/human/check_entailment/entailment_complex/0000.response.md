### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree structure. The game starts with a stone on a given node, and players take turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node. The player who cannot make a move loses.

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to determine if the game starting from a given node will result in a win for the first player (Ron). It does this by performing a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given node.
   - The function returns `False` if the starting node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children other than its parent).
   - For non-leaf nodes, it recursively calls itself for each child node, inverting the result (using `not`), and collects these results in the `distances` list.
   - The function returns `True` if any of the results in the `distances` list is `True`, indicating that there is at least one path from the current node that leads to a win for the first player.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input to construct the tree and determine the starting node.
   - It initializes the tree structure using a `defaultdict` of lists.
   - It identifies all the leaf nodes and stores them in a deque.
   - It reads the starting node and calls `func_1` to determine if Ron (the first player) can win from that starting node.
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, it prints either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#### Correctness of the Code:

- **Logic**: The logic of the game is correctly implemented in the code. The function `func_1` correctly uses the concept of Nim-values (or Grundy numbers) in combinatorial game theory, where a node returns `True` if there is at least one path that leads to a win for the player who starts from that node.
- **Implementation**: The implementation of the DFS in `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies leaf nodes and recursively evaluates the game state for non-leaf nodes.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as trees with only two nodes and trees with multiple branches.
- **Output**: The output is correctly determined based on the result of `func_1`.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game for the given problem description.
