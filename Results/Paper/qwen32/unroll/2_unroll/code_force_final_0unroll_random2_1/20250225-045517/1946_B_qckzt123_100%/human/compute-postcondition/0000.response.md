Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. MOD is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `1000000007`. All other variables remain unchanged as the code snippet only introduces the `MOD` variable.
