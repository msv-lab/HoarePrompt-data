To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the loop and its impact on the variables. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n`: An integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
   - `num`: An integer value provided by the input.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `num` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `num2` is read from the input.
     - `case` is read from the input.
     - If `num2` is greater than 10000, the loop breaks, and specific values are printed (1 and 16668).
     - Otherwise, `a` is updated to a list of integers from `case`.
     - The list `b` is a sorted version of `a`.
     - The median of `b` is determined based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
     - The code then increments the median value in `b` until it is greater than the original median, counting the number of operations (`op`).
     - The number of operations (`op`) is printed.

3. **Output State:**
   - The loop may break early if `num2` is greater than 10000, in which case the output will be specific values (1 and 16668) and the loop will terminate early.
   - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, the output will be the number of operations (`op`) for each iteration.
   - The variables `t`, `n`, and the initial list `a` remain unchanged unless they are affected by the loop, which they are not in this case.

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state depends on the values of `num2` and `case` provided during each iteration. Since the problem specifies that we need to describe the state in natural language and not the exact values, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- If `num2` is ever greater than 10000 during any iteration, the loop breaks early, and the output will be `1` followed by `16668`.
- Otherwise, for each iteration, the output will be the number of operations (`op`) required to make the median of the list greater than its original value.

Output State: **The output state will consist of either `1` followed by `16668` if `num2` is greater than 10000 during any iteration, or the number of operations (`op`) for each iteration if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early. The values of `t`, `n`, and the initial list `a` remain unchanged.**
