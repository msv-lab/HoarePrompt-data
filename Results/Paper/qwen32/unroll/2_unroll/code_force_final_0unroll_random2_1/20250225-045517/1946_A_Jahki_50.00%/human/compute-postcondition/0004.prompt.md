You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: - The loop may break early if `num2` is greater than 10000, in which case the output will be specific values (1 and 16668) and the loop will terminate early.
    #   - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, the output will be the number of operations (`op`) for each iteration.
    #   - The variables `t`, `n`, and the initial list `a` remain unchanged unless they are affected by the loop, which they are not in this case.
    #
    #Given the loop's behavior, the final output state depends on the values of `num2` and `case` provided during each iteration. Since the problem specifies that we need to describe the state in natural language and not the exact values, we can summarize the output state as follows:
    #
    #- If `num2` is ever greater than 10000 during any iteration, the loop breaks early, and the output will be `1` followed by `16668`.
    #- Otherwise, for each iteration, the output will be the number of operations (`op`) required to make the median of the list greater than its original value.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided integers.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
