Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the river grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers being 0; `costs` is a list where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows` with the argument `d`; `total_costs` is an empty list.**

This means that the initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged. The only change is that `total_costs` has been initialized as an empty list.
