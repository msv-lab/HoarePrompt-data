### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided solution and the correctness of the functions `func_1` and `func_2` based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:

1. **Grid Representation**: The river is an `n x m` grid where `a[i][j]` represents the depth of the cell at row `i` and column `j`. The first and last columns are river banks with a depth of 0.
2. **Bridge Construction**: We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows. Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column of a row, and supports must be placed in the first and last columns with a maximum distance `d` between any two adjacent supports.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost to place a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`. The goal is to minimize the total cost of placing supports for all `k` bridges.

#### Solution Analysis Recap:

##### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`

- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row such that the distance between adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- **Implementation**:
  - The first loop initializes the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to their depth.
  - The second loop iterates from `d-1` to the end of the row. For each cell, it calculates the minimum cost to place a support considering the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds 1 to the current cell's depth.
  - The function returns the cost of placing supports in the last cell of the row.

The issue with `func_1` is that it does not correctly enforce the constraint that the distance between adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. It incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for each cell by only considering the previous `d` cells, which does not ensure that the supports are placed with the required distance constraint.

##### Function `func_2()`

- **Purpose**: Read the input, compute the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation**:
  - Reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
  - Reads the grid of depths.
  - Computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
  - Prints the minimum total cost.

Since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is incorrect because the function does not correctly calculate the cost for each row while satisfying the constraints on the distance between supports.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row while satisfying the constraints on the distance between supports.

2. **Total Cost Calculation in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row while satisfying the constraints on the distance between supports.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
