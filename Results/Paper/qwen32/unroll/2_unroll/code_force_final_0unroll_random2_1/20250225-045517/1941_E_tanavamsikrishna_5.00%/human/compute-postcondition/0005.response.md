To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, let's break down the loop and understand what it does.

The loop iterates over the `costs` list, calculating the sum of `k` consecutive elements at a time and appending these sums to the `total_costs` list. The loop runs from the start of the `costs` list to the point where there are still `k` elements left to sum.

Let's denote the length of the `costs` list as `len_costs`. The loop runs for `len_costs - (k - 1)` iterations, which means it calculates the sum of every possible `k`-sized contiguous sub-list of `costs`.

Given the initial state, the output state will only change the `total_costs` list, as it is the only variable being modified inside the loop. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`) remain unchanged.

Here's the output state in the required format:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, `total_costs` (where `total_costs` is a list of sums of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list).**
