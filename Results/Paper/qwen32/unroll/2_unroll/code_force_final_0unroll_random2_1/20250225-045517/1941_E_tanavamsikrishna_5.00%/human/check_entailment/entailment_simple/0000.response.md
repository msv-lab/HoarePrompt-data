### Reasoning:

The provided Python code is intended to solve the problem by calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for bridges over the river. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and its correctness:

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row.
   - It first increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
   - Then, for each subsequent element, it calculates the cost as the sum of its original value, the minimum value of the previous `d` elements, and 1.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the row, which represents the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles the overall logic for each test case.
   - It reads the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the grid of river depths into a list of rows.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of these total costs.

### Issues in the Code:
- The function `func_1(row, d)` is not correctly calculating the minimum cost for placing supports. The logic for calculating the cost for each element in the row is flawed. Specifically, the calculation `(min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` does not correctly account for the requirement that supports must be placed within a distance `d` of each other.
- The function `func_1` does not ensure that supports are placed at the first and last columns, which are required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the implementation of `func_1`, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
