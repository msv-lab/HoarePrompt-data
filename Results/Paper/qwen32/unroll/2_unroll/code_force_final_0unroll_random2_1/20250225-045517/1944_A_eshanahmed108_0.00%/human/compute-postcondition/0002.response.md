Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` for each of the `t` test cases, where `n` represents the number of elements and `k` represents a value related to the number of pairs or connections that can be formed. The function returns a result based on these inputs, which is not explicitly detailed here but follows the constraints provided.**
