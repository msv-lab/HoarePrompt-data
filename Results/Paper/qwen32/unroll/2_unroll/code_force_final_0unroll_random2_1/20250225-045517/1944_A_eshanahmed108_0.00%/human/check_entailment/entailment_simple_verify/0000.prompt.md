You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. There are t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: the sequence of printed values for each test case, determined by the condition `n if n - k <= 1 else 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The given program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the line `print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)` is incorrect for some scenarios. 

Let's analyze the logic:
- The program prints `n` if `n - k <= 1`. This means that if the number of islands minus the number of bridges destroyed is less than or equal to 1, Everule can still visit all `n` islands. However, this condition is too simplistic and does not account for the actual connectivity of the islands after destroying `k` bridges.
- The program prints `1` if `n - k > 1`. This means that if more than one island can still be potentially reachable after destroying `k` bridges, the program assumes that only island 1 is reachable. This is incorrect because Everule can still visit more than one island depending on which bridges are destroyed.

Let's consider a specific counterexample:
- Suppose `n = 4` and `k = 2`. According to the problem, Dominater can destroy at most 2 bridges. If Dominater destroys two bridges that do not disconnect island 1 from the rest of the islands, Everule can still visit more than one island. However, the program will print `1`, which is incorrect. For instance, if Dominater destroys the bridges between islands (1,2) and (1,3), Everule can still visit islands 1, 4, and potentially others depending on the remaining bridges.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is incorrect.
