Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then prints their sum. However, this approach does not account for overlapping substrings or the requirement to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the test case:
```
1
6
pmapie
```
The program would count one "map" and one "pie", resulting in an output of 2. However, the correct answer is 1, as removing the 'm' from "pmapie" would result in "paie", which does not contain "map" or "pie".

The program needs to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to ensure that it removes the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
