Let's analyze the given Python program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This implies that it assumes all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, which is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(a + b = a + 1\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot a = a\), and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(a\) when \(a = 1\).

3. **Loop for \(b > 1\)**:
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) and adds this to `ans`.

#### Correctness Evaluation
- The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- However, the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly account for the condition involving \(\gcd(a, b)\). It assumes \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) for all \(a\), which is incorrect. The \(\gcd(a, b)\) can be any divisor of \(b\), and the formula should be adjusted accordingly.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used does not properly account for the \(\gcd(a, b)\) in the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
