Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` for each test case, with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function is called multiple times with up to t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^6. The function returns a value based on the input integers `n` and `m` for each test case.**
