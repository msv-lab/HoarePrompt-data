Output State: **The variable `ans` holds the final computed value for each test case, and it is printed after processing each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, and `b` are local to the loop and do not persist after the loop's execution for each test case. The variable `T` is the loop index for iterating through the test cases and does not persist after the loop completes. The input variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.**
