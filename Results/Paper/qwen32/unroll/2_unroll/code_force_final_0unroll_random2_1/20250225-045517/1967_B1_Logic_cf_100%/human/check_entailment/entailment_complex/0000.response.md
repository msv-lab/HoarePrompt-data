### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program correctly solves the given problem, we need to verify whether the logic used in the program aligns with the requirements of the problem.

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The given program calculates `ans` for each test case using the following logic:
- Initialize `ans` to `n`.
- For each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`:
  - Add \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.
- Print `ans`.

Let's analyze if this logic correctly computes the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is because for \(b = 1\), \(a + b = a + 1\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\). Thus, \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1, and there are `n` valid pairs for \(b = 1\) (i.e., \((1, 1), (2, 1), \ldots, (n, 1)\)).

2. **Loop for \(b \ge 2\)**:
   - For each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), the program adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.
   - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) counts the number of valid `a` values for a given `b` such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\):
- Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = k \cdot d\) and \(b = l \cdot d\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\) where \(\gcd(k, l) = 1\).
- The condition becomes \(k \cdot d + l \cdot d\) is a multiple of \(l \cdot d \cdot d = l \cdot d^2\).
- Simplifying, \(k + l\) must be a multiple of \(l \cdot d\).
- This means \(k\) must be such that \(k + l = t \cdot l \cdot d\) for some integer \(t\), which simplifies to \(k = (t - 1) \cdot l \cdot d - l\).

The program's logic seems to be counting the number of such valid `k` values for each `b`, but it does not explicitly check the \(\gcd\) condition. Instead, it uses a simplified formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) which might not directly correspond to the correct count of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem's condition. The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not directly ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
