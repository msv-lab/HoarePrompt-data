You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function will be called multiple times with a total of t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):

        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `ans` holds the final computed value for each test case, and it is printed after processing each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, and `b` are local to the loop and do not persist after the loop's execution for each test case. The variable `T` is the loop index for iterating through the test cases and does not persist after the loop completes. The input variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description.

The condition to check is whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the program calculates `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, which does not correctly implement the required logic.

Let's look at a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

For the input:
```
1
10 8
```
The program will calculate:
```python
ans = 10
for b in range(2, min(10, 8) + 1):
    ans = ans + (10 + b) // (b * b)
```
Breaking it down:
- `b = 2`: `ans = 10 + (10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 10 + 3 = 13`
- `b = 3`: `ans = 13 + (10 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 13 + 1 = 14`
- `b = 4`: `ans = 14 + (10 + 4) // (4 * 4) = 14 + 0 = 14`
- `b = 5`: `ans = 14 + (10 + 5) // (5 * 5) = 14 + 0 = 14`
- `b = 6`: `ans = 14 + (10 + 6) // (6 * 6) = 14 + 0 = 14`
- `b = 7`: `ans = 14 + (10 + 7) // (7 * 7) = 14 + 0 = 14`
- `b = 8`: `ans = 14 + (10 + 8) // (8 * 8) = 14 + 0 = 14`

Thus, the output will be `14`, but let's verify the correct pairs manually:
- `(1, 1)`: `1 + 1 = 2`, `gcd(1, 1) = 1`, `2 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(2, 1)`: `2 + 1 = 3`, `gcd(2, 1) = 1`, `3 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(2, 2)`: `2 + 2 = 4`, `gcd(2, 2) = 2`, `4 % (2 * 2) = 0` (valid)
- `(3, 1)`: `3 + 1 = 4`, `gcd(3, 1) = 1`, `4 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(4, 1)`: `4 + 1 = 5`, `gcd(4, 1) = 1`, `5 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(5, 1)`: `5 + 1 = 6`, `gcd(5, 1) = 1`, `6 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(6, 1)`: `6 + 1 = 7`, `gcd(6, 1) = 1`, `7 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(6, 2)`: `6 + 2 = 8`, `gcd(6, 2) = 2`, `8 % (2 * 2) = 0` (valid)
- `(6, 3)`: `6 + 3 = 9`, `gcd(6, 3) = 3`, `9 % (3 * 3) = 0` (valid)
- `(7, 1)`: `7 + 1 = 8`, `gcd(7, 1) = 1`, `8 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(8, 1)`: `8 + 1 = 9`, `gcd(8, 1) = 1`, `9 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(9, 1)`: `9 + 1 = 10`, `gcd(9, 1) = 1`, `10 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(10, 1)`: `10 + 1 = 11`, `gcd(10, 1) = 1`, `11 % (1 * 1) = 0` (valid)
- `(10, 2)`: `10 + 2 = 12`, `gcd(10, 2) = 2`, `12 % (2 * 2) = 0` (valid)

Thus, the correct answer should be `14`, but the logic in the program is incorrect and does not account for all valid pairs correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
