You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, two integers x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, two integers x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is a list of integers representing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list of integers representing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns `results`, which is a list of integers where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `results`, which is a list of integers representing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
