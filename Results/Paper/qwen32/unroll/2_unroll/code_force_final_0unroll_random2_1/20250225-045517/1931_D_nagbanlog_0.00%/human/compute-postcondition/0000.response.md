The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `t`, `test_cases`, and all their respective contents remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, two integers x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list.**
