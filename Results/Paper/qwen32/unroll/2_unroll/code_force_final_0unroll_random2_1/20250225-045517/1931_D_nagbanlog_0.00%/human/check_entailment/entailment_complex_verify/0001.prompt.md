You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #The program returns `results`, which is a list of integers representing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and two additional integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates and returns the count of "beautiful pairs" in the list. A "beautiful pair" is defined based on the remainders of the elements when divided by `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of counts, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the number of pairs \((i, j)\) in the array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of modulo values \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\).
   - It also initializes `beautiful_count` to 0, which will store the count of beautiful pairs.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`:
     - It calculates `mod_x` as `num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
     - It calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is because \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\), which simplifies to \(a_i \equiv x - a_j \pmod{x}\).
     - `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y` because \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

3. **Checking for Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is already in `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count` because all pairs that have the same modulo values `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` will form a beautiful pair with the current number `num`.
   - It then updates the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, the program appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list and continues with the next test case.

### Correctness Verification

The program correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic. It efficiently counts pairs using a frequency dictionary, which allows it to avoid a time-consuming nested loop approach.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program's logic. The condition `required_mod_y = mod_y` is correct for checking if \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\), but the program assumes that pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` and `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` are inverses in terms of forming beautiful pairs. This logic is correct because if \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\) and \(a_i \equiv x - a_j \pmod{x}\), then the pair \((i, j)\) satisfies the conditions for being a beautiful pair.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
