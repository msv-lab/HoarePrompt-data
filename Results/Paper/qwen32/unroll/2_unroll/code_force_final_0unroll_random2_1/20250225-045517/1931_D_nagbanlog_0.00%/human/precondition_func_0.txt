t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, two integers x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
