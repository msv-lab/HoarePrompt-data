The function `moedasMinimas` will take input as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `m` where `1 <= m <= n <= 200,000`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`, and the third line contains `n` integers `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n` where `1 <= b_i <= 10^9`. The total number of people across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
