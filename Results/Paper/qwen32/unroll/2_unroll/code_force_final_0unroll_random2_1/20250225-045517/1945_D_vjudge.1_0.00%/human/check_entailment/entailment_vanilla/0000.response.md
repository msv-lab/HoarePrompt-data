Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- **Kirill** is at the end of a queue of `n` people.
- **Objective**: Move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions in the queue while minimizing the cost.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - If Kirill swaps with the person at position `j`, he pays `a_j` coins.
  - For each person between `j` and `i` (where `i` is Kirill's current position), he pays `b_k` coins.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: Handles a single test case.
2. `func_2`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading and Reversing**:
   - Reads `n` and `m` (renamed as `k` in the code).
   - Reads `a_i` and `b_i` values and reverses both lists.
   - **Reasoning**: Reversing the lists makes it easier to work from the end of the queue towards the front, which aligns with Kirill's objective of moving from the end to one of the first `m` positions.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation (`soma_b`)**:
   - Initializes `soma_b` to 0, which will accumulate the cost of moving past people.
   - Iterates through the first `n - k` people (positions that Kirill can potentially swap with to reach one of the first `m` positions).
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If `a_i < b_i` for the `i-th` person, it adds the accumulated `soma_b` and `a_i` to `pref` (the prefix cost), and resets `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_i` to `soma_b`.

3. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - Initializes `resultado` to infinity.
   - Iterates through the last `k` people (positions that Kirill can potentially end up in).
   - For each position, it calculates the total cost as `pref + soma_b + a_i` and updates `resultado` with the minimum cost.
   - Adds `b_i` to `soma_b` after each iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum cost `resultado`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Reversing Lists**: The reversal of lists simplifies the problem by allowing us to work from the end of the queue towards the front, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - The algorithm correctly accumulates the cost of moving past people (`soma_b`) and the cost of swapping (`a_i`).
  - The decision to add `a_i` and `soma_b` to `pref` when `a_i < b_i` ensures that Kirill only pays the minimum necessary cost for each swap.
  - The final loop calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

**Correctness:** **True**
