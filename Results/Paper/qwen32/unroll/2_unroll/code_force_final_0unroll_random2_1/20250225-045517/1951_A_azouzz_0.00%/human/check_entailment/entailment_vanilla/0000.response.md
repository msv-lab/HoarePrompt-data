Reasoning:  
The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description outlines a Python script that scans a directory for subfolders with numeric names within a specified range, and for each subfolder, it looks for `.html` files. For each `.html` file, it generates two new files, one ending with `-ac.py` and the other with `-wa.py`. 

However, the given program defines a function `func_1()` that reads input values, processes them based on the count of '1' in a string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. This logic is entirely unrelated to the problem description provided.

Therefore, the given program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
