The code snippet calculates the number of 'U' characters in the string part of the `case` tuple and assigns this count to the variable `ups`. The initial state specifies that `case` is a tuple where the first element is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U' and 'D'.

Output State: **`case` is a tuple where the first element is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U' and 'D', where 'U' represents a coin facing up and 'D' represents a coin facing down; `ups` is the count of 'U' characters in the string part of `case`.**
