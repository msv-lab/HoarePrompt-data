Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem statement, particularly the requirement that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n-2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i+1} \neq 0\). The program does not ensure that no two non-zero elements are adjacent in the array.

Let's analyze the provided program with an example input to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
15
```

The correct output should be:
```
5
-1 0 0 0 1
```
This is because \(15 = (-1) \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^4\).

However, the provided program might generate an incorrect output like:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
This output is incorrect because it violates the condition that no two non-zero elements should be adjacent.

Let's look at another example:
Consider the input:
```
1
27
```

The correct output should be:
```
6
-1 0 -1 0 0 1
```
This is because \(27 = (-1) \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + (-1) \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^4 + 1 \cdot 2^5\).

However, the provided program might generate an incorrect output like:
```
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
This output is incorrect because it violates the condition that no two non-zero elements should be adjacent.

Given these examples, it is clear that the program does not correctly handle the requirement of ensuring no two non-zero elements are adjacent in the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
