You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program creates a list `s` to represent the binary form of `x` with 30 bits (since `x < 2^30`).
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine if each bit is set in `x` and appends '1' or '0' to `s` accordingly.

3. **Adjusting the Binary Representation:**
   - The program then iterates over the list `s` to adjust the binary representation to meet the problem's constraints:
     - If two consecutive bits are '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and the second '1' to '0'.
     - If a '0' follows a '-1', it changes the '0' to '1'.
     - If the last bit is '0' and a '-1' was set previously, it changes the last bit to '1'.
     - If the last bit is '1' and a '-1' was set previously, it changes the last bit to '0' and appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program then iterates over the list again to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
     - If a '-1' is followed by a '1', it swaps them.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the adjusted list and the list itself.

### Issues and Corrections

- **Binary Representation:** The program correctly generates the binary representation of `x` with 30 bits.
- **Adjusting the Binary Representation:** The logic for adjusting the binary representation to meet the problem's constraints seems correct. It ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by using '-1' to balance consecutive '1's.
- **Final Adjustment:** The final adjustment to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist is also correct.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program that can lead to incorrect results:

- **Handling of the Last Bit:** When the last bit is '0' and a '-1' was set previously, the program changes the last bit to '1'. This is correct. However, if the last bit is '1' and a '-1' was set previously, the program changes the last bit to '0' and appends an additional '1'. This can lead to an incorrect length and representation if the original `x` was already a power of 2 or if the adjustments were not correctly handled.

### Example Issue

Consider the input `x = 1`:
- The binary representation is `00000000000000000000000000000001`.
- The program will not change this representation.
- However, if the last bit is '1' and a '-1' was set previously (which should not happen in this case), the program would incorrectly append an additional '1', leading to an incorrect length and representation.

### Conclusion

Despite the logic seeming correct, there is a potential issue with the handling of the last bit when a '-1' was set previously. This can lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.
