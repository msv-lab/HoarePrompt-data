Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. If `n` and `k` meet certain conditions, it returns one value; otherwise, it returns a different value. The specific conditions and return values are not detailed here, but the function handles up to `t` test cases with the constraints provided.**
