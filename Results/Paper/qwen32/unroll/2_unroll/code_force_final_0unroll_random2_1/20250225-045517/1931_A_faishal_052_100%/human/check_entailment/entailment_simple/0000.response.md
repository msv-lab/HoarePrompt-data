Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that corresponds to a given encoded sum. Here are the key steps and checks for correctness:

1. **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the encoded sum `n`.

2. **Logic for Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then tries to determine the values of the three letters by reducing the encoded sum `lex` in a specific manner:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` (representing the letter 'a') and reduces `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` (representing the letter 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 to `arr` (representing the letter 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After processing two letters, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr` as the third letter.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.

3. **Conversion to Characters and Output:**
   - The program converts each value in `arr` to its corresponding character by adding 96 (since 'a' is ASCII 97).
   - It concatenates these characters to form the final 3-letter word and prints it.

However, there is a flaw in the logic for determining the values of the letters. The program does not correctly handle all cases of `lex` and may not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might incorrectly assign 'a', 'z', and 'z' instead of 'a', 'a', and 'v'.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:
- Start with the smallest possible letters.
- Distribute the remaining sum among the three letters while ensuring the smallest possible values are used first.

Given the flawed logic, the program is not always correct.

Correctness: **False**
