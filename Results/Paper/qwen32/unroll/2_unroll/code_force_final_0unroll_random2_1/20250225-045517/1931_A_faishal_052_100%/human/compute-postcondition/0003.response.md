To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, representing the number of test cases.
   - `info` is an initially empty list that will store the results of each test case.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each of the `cases` test cases, the following steps are performed:
     - An empty list `arr` is initialized.
     - `lex` is read from the input, representing some integer value for the current test case.
     - A nested loop runs for `j` in the range (2), meaning it will execute twice for each test case.
       - If `lex` is less than 28, `1` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by 1.
       - If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `26` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by 26.
       - If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `26` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by 26.
     - After the nested loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.
     - The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
     - The sorted list `arr` is appended to `info`.

3. **Output State**:
   - `info` will contain a list of lists, where each inner list represents the result of processing one test case.
   - Each inner list will have three elements:
     - The first two elements are either `1` or `26`, depending on the initial value of `lex`.
     - The third element is the remaining value of `lex` after processing the first two elements.
     - The inner list is sorted, so the smallest value will be first.

Let's summarize the output state in the required format:

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of lists, each of which has three sorted elements representing the processed values of `lex` for each test case.**
