You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given encoded integer `n`.
- The letters are numbered from 1 to 26, 'a' = 1, 'z' = 26.
- The program should output the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
3. It then tries to construct a list `arr` of three numbers that sum to `lex` by:
   - Checking if `lex` is less than 28, and if so, appending 1 to `arr` and reducing `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and reduces `lex` by 26.
4. The remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.
5. The list `arr` is sorted.
6. The sorted list `arr` is converted to a string of characters and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic in the program is flawed and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.

#### Example of a Faulty Case:
Consider `n = 78`. The program will:
- Append 26 to `arr` twice, reducing `lex` to 26.
- Append 26 to `arr` again, reducing `lex` to 0.
- Sort `arr` which remains [26, 26, 26].
- Convert this to the string "zzz".

However, the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 78 is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70 + 8 = 78), not "zzz".

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
