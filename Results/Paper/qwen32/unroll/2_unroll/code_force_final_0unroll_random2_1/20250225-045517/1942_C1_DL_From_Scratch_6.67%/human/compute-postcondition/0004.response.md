Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a total number of vertices `n`, a number of chosen vertices `x`, and a list of `x` distinct chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the number of gaps of size 1 between the sorted chosen vertices and the gap between the last chosen vertex and `n`.**
