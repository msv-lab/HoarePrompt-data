The function calculates and returns the difference between the time at which the pinball leaves the grid from the last cell and the time at which it leaves from the cell that is `times + 1` positions from the end of the list `arr`. If `times` is such that `-1 - times` is out of bounds, it uses the first element of the list instead.
