The code snippet creates a list `pre` that contains the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of the character '>' in the string `s1`. The original string `s1` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The new list `pre` will contain integers corresponding to the positions of '>' in `s1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' in `s1`.**
