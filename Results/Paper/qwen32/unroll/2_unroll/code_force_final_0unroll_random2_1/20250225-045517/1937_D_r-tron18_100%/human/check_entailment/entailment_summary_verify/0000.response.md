### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several key issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Inversion of Characters**: The problem explicitly states that after the pinball moves from a cell, the character in that cell is inverted. However, the provided program does not incorporate this inversion logic. The program seems to rely on precomputed indices and accumulated values, which inherently do not account for the dynamic changes in the grid.

2. **Simulation Logic**: The program does not simulate the pinball's movement step-by-step according to the rules provided. Instead, it uses complex mathematical manipulations involving accumulated values (`accumulate` function) and precomputed indices. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to simulate the movement and account for the inversion of characters after each move.

3. **Testing with Example**: The original assessment tests the program with the provided example and notes that the output does not match the expected results. This further supports the claim that the program's logic is incorrect.

4. **Function Summary**: The function summary describes `func_2` as computing a list of values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters without explicitly mentioning the inversion logic. This aligns with the observation that the program does not handle the inversion of characters.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and does not handle the inversion of characters as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
