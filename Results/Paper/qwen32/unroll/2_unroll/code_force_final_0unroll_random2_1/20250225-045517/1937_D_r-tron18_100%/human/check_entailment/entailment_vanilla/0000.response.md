The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using some pre-computation and accumulation techniques, but it does not seem to correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters as described in the problem statement.

Let's analyze the core logic of the provided program:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**: This function seems to be calculating a difference between accumulated values. However, it is not clear how it relates to the problem at hand.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**: This function is supposed to compute the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. It uses some prefix and suffix accumulations, but the logic does not match the problem's requirements.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Character Inversion**: The program does not actually invert the characters in the grid as the pinball moves. This is a critical step in the problem's rules.
- **Movement Simulation**: The program seems to be trying to calculate the result using some mathematical trick or pre-computation, but it does not simulate the pinball's movement step by step, which is necessary to ensure correctness.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the grid is entirely '<' or '>', or when the pinball starts at the edge of the grid.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position and inverting the characters as the pinball moves. This can be done using a simple loop for each query, which is feasible given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
