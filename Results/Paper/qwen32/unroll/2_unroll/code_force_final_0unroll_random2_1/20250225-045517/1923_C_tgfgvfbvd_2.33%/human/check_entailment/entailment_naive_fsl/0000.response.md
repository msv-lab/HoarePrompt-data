Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good".
- A subarray is "good" if there exists an array `b` of the same length such that:
  1. The sum of elements in the subarray of `c` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. Each element in the subarray of `c` is not equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
  3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and then for each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray can be split into two parts such that the sum of one part is at least twice the length of the subarray. If this condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Key Points:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array `c`.
   - The prefix sum `p[i]` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `c`.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not check if the subarray can be transformed into an array `b` where each element in `b` is different from `c` and greater than 0.
- The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into a valid array `b` according to the problem's constraints.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
- The subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`, and its sum is `3`.
- The length of the subarray is `3`.
- The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` translates to `3 >= 2 * 3`, which is `False`.
- Therefore, the program will output `NO`.

However, let's try to construct a valid array `b`:
- We need `b` such that `b[0] + b[1] + b[2] = 3` and `b[i] > 0` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
- One possible `b` could be `[2, 1, 0]`, but `b[2]` is not greater than 0.
- Another possible `b` could be `[2, 0, 1]`, but `b[1]` is not greater than 0.
- It is impossible to create such an array `b`.

For this input, the correct output should be `NO` because it is impossible to create a valid array `b` that meets all the conditions. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. It only checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, which is not a sufficient condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
