You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` is an input integer; `check` is 2147483647.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. For each integer in the list, it calculates a value based on the XOR operation with a fixed constant (2^31 - 1). It then updates a dictionary to track occurrences of these values and adjusts a counter `ans` to reflect the number of unique values. The function prints the updated counter after processing each integer in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires dividing `n` non-negative integers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit in their 31 least significant bits. The goal is to find the minimum number of such groups.

### Key Points:
1. **Bitwise XOR with `2^31 - 1`:** The number `2^31 - 1` is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1. XORing any integer `i` with `2^31 - 1` flips all the bits of `i` in the least significant 31 bits.
2. **Dictionary Usage:** The program uses a dictionary `dic` to keep track of numbers and their complements (flipped bit versions). This is intended to match numbers that can be placed in the same group.
3. **Group Counting:** The variable `ans` is used to keep track of the minimum number of groups needed. It starts at `n` (the total number of integers) and decreases as numbers are paired and placed in the same group.

### Program Analysis:
Here's a detailed look at the program's logic:
1. **Input Reading:** The program reads the number of test cases `times` and processes each test case independently.
2. **Initialization:** For each test case, it initializes `ans` to `n` (the number of integers) and `check` to `2**31 - 1`.
3. **Processing Each Integer:**
   - For each integer `i` in the input list, it calculates `s` as `i ^ check`.
   - If `s` is already in the dictionary, it means there is a number that can be paired with `i` (because `i` and `s` are complements in the least significant 31 bits). It reduces the count of `s` in the dictionary and decreases `ans` by 1. If the count of `s` becomes 0, it removes `s` from the dictionary.
   - If `i` is already in the dictionary, it means `i` has been seen before and can potentially be paired with another number that has already been processed. It increases the count of `i` in the dictionary.
   - If neither `s` nor `i` is in the dictionary, it adds `i` to the dictionary with a count of 1.
4. **Output:** The program prints the value of `ans` after processing all integers in the current test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Group Counting:** The program incorrectly assumes that if `s` is in the dictionary, it can always be paired with `i`. However, this is not always true. The program does not ensure that the pairing is valid or that it minimizes the number of groups correctly.
2. **Incorrect Dictionary Usage:** The program uses the dictionary to track counts of numbers and their complements but does not handle the pairing logic correctly. It does not ensure that the numbers are placed in the minimum number of groups.
3. **Output Placement:** The program prints the value of `ans` after processing each integer, which is incorrect. It should print the final value of `ans` after processing all integers in the test case.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic and implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
