Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: We need to determine if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The array can have up to 50 elements.
   - Each element is an integer between 0 and 99.
   - We can perform the operation any number of times (including zero).

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.
   - It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (from index `m-1` to `1`).
   - If an element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it checks if splitting `arr[i-1]` into its digits and placing `arr[i]` at the end results in a sorted subarray.
   - If the subarray is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `arr[i-1]` is split, it updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The program incorrectly assumes that if splitting `arr[i-1]` and placing `arr[i]` at the end results in a sorted subarray, the entire array can be sorted. This is not necessarily true.
- **Incomplete Check**: The program only checks the immediate subarray after a split and does not ensure that the rest of the array remains sorted.
- **Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program does not handle multiple splits correctly. It only considers the immediate effect of a single split.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine if the entire array can be sorted by the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
