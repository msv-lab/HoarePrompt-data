You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be modified such that each element is greater than or equal to the previous one by potentially replacing each element with the first digit of the previous element if the current element is smaller. It prints "YES" if such a modification is possible for the entire list, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly handles all cases as per the problem description.

The program is supposed to determine if it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits and inserting them back into the array.

Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting**: The program only checks if the current element and the previous element can be sorted together after splitting the previous element. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple splits are required or when the splits need to be inserted into the array in a way that maintains the sorted order.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting**: The program attempts to split the previous element and check if the resulting list (including the current element) is sorted. If it is not sorted, it immediately returns "NO". However, this does not account for the possibility of further splits on other elements or the need to insert multiple digits from the split element into the array.

3. **Incorrect Update of Array**: After a split, the program only updates the first element of the split in the array, which is insufficient to maintain the correct order or to fully explore the possibilities of further splits.

### Potential Counterexample

Consider the following input:

```
1
4
12 39 3 4
```

The correct output should be "YES" because we can split `12` into `1` and `2`, and `39` into `3` and `9`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 9, 3, 4]`, which can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 9]`, a sorted array.

However, the provided program would likely return "NO" for this input because it does not correctly handle the multiple splits and the need to maintain the sorted order after each split.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
