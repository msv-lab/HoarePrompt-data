In the given task, the for loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set to a value that will allow the loop to execute at least once.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. Since the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, and given that `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 50, no adjustment to `n` is strictly necessary for the loop to execute. However, to adhere to the provided constraints and ensure the loop executes, we can state that `n` must be within its given range.

Thus, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop will execute, is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99**
