### Reasoning:

The provided program's logic is flawed. The program attempts to iterate through the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element is smaller than the previous one. If it is, the program tries to split the previous element and see if the resulting array can be sorted. However, this approach does not correctly handle all cases and does not fully utilize the allowed operations.

Here are the flaws in the logic:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Digit Splitting**: The program only considers splitting the previous element and appending the current element to check if the resulting array is sorted. However, the correct approach should involve considering all possible splits of the previous element and checking if the array can be made sorted by performing these splits.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The current approach is greedy and does not consider all possible ways to split elements to achieve a sorted array.

### Correct Approach:
A more appropriate approach would be to use a dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that checks if the array can be made sorted by iteratively splitting elements and ensuring the resulting array is non-decreasing.

### Example:
For the second test case:
```
3
12 28 5
```
The program incorrectly concludes that it is not possible to sort the array by only considering splitting the element `28` and checking if the resulting array `[2, 8, 5]` is sorted, which it is not. However, by splitting `12` into `[1, 2]`, the array can be made `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, and then by splitting `28` into `[2, 8]`, the array can be made `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, and finally, by splitting `5` into `[5]` (which doesn't change the array), the array can be sorted as `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
