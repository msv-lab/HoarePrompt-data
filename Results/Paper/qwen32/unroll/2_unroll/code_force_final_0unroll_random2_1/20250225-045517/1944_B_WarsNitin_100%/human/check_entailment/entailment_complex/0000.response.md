### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by dividing the input array `a` into two halves `b` and `c`, sorting these halves, and then constructing two arrays `ans1` and `ans2` such that their bitwise XOR is equal. However, there are several issues and logical gaps in the provided code that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Selection of Elements:**
   - The program uses the first and last unique elements from the sorted halves `b` and `c` to build the `l` list. This approach does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal.
   - The program then adds pairs of identical elements from `b` and `c` to `ans1` and `ans2` respectively, which might not contribute to balancing the XOR values between the two lists.

2. **Handling of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` is doubled at the start of the loop, but the code does not ensure that exactly `2k` elements are selected for `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of elements selected from `b` and `c` does not meet the required `2k` elements.

3. **Balancing XOR:**
   - The program does not attempt to balance the XOR values between `ans1` and `ans2`. The selection of elements is based on their positions and occurrences, not on their contribution to the XOR equality.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the input array `a` has specific patterns that might require a more sophisticated approach to ensure the XOR equality.

### Correctness:
Given the logical gaps and issues in the provided code, it is incorrect for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
