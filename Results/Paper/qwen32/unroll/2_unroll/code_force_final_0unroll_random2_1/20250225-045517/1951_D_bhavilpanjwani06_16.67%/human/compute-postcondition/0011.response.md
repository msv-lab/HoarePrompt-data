Given the initial state, we have the following variables and conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are two positive integers read from the input, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (\(n \geq k\)).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (\(n \neq k\)).
- \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\).

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(2)
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `2`. There are no variables or conditions in the initial state that influence the output of this specific `print` statement. The value `2` is explicitly stated in the code.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2**
