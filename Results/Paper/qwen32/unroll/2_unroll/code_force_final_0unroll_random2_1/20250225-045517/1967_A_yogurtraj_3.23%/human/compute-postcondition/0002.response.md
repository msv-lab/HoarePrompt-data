Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of distinct types of cards, and an integer `k` representing the number of coins. It also accepts a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` represents the number of cards of type `i` initially available. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the provided information but typically would be related to the number of cards that can be obtained or some other computation based on the given `n`, `k`, and the list of `a_i`.**
