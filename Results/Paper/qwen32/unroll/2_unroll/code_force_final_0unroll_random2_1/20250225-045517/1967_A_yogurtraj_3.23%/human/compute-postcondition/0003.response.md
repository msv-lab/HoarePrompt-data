Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of distinct card types `n`, a number of coins `k`, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the initial count of cards for each type. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the distribution of coins among the card types, which is derived from the given inputs.**
