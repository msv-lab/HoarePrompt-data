The code snippet assigns a value to `idx` based on the value of `n`. Specifically, `idx` is set to `(n - 1) // 2`. The values of `odds`, `n`, `a`, and `prev` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `prev` is 0, `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
