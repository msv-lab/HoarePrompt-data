### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the provided code: the absence of the `MOD` constant definition, which leads to a `NameError` when the code is executed. The problem description explicitly states that the results should be computed modulo 998,244,353, and the code must reflect this requirement.

The suggested fix in the original assessment is accurate and necessary. Adding the line `MOD = 998244353` at the beginning of the program will resolve the `NameError` and ensure that all arithmetic operations involving the modulo are correctly applied.

However, the original assessment does not mention any other potential issues in the code. After reviewing the code again, there are no apparent logical errors or other issues that would prevent the code from correctly solving the problem once the `MOD` constant is defined.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the missing `MOD` constant. Once this issue is resolved, the code should work correctly based on the provided function summaries and the problem description.

Final: **True**
