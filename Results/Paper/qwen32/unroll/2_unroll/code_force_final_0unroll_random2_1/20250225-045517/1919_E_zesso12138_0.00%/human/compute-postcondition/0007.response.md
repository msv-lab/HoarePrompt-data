To determine the output state after the execution of the loop, we need to understand what each iteration of the loop does. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
2. In each iteration:
   - `n` is updated to the integer value of the next element in `data` (pointed by `index`), and `index` is incremented by 1.
   - `p` is updated to a list of integers of length `n`, starting from the current `index` in `data`, and `index` is incremented by `n`.
   - `result` is calculated by calling `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `result` is appended to the `results` list.

The final state of the variables after the loop finishes will be:
- `n` will hold the value of `data[index - n]` from the last iteration.
- `p` will hold the list of integers `data[index - n:index]` from the last iteration.
- `index` will be `1 + 1 + n1 + n2 + ... + nt`, where `ni` is the size of the `p` list in the `i-th` iteration.
- `t` will remain unchanged as it is the number of iterations.
- `results` will be a list of results calculated by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

Since the exact values of `data`, `n`, `p`, and the results of `func_1` are not provided, we describe the final state in terms of the last iteration.

Output State: **`n` is the size of the array `a` from the last iteration, `p` is the list of prefix sums from the last iteration, `index` is the position after the last prefix sums in `data`, `t` is the number of iterations, and `results` is a list of results from each iteration of `func_1(n, p)`.**
