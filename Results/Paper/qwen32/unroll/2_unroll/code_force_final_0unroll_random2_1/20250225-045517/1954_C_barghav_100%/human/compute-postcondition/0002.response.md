Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, `x` and `y` have the same number of digits in each test case; `a` is a list of characters representing the input string; `b` is a list of characters representing the input string; `f` is 0.**

In simple terms, the variable `f` is now set to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
