Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem description, the program should output either 'A' or 'B' when they appear with the same frequency. However, the current implementation will always output 'B' in such cases, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input string "AABBB" and "AABBA". Both strings have the same frequency of 'A' and 'B' (3 and 2 respectively, and 2 and 3 respectively), but the program will output 'B' for both, which is incorrect for the second case.

Here is a corrected version of the program that handles this case:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif h > l:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # or print('B'), as the problem does not specify which one to choose when counts are equal

```

However, since the original program does not handle the tie case correctly, it is considered incorrect.
