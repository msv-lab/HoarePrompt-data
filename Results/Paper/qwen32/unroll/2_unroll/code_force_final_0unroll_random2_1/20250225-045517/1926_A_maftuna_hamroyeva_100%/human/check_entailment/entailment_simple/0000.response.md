### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of the given 5-character strings. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads an integer `t`, which denotes the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, each time reading a 5-character string consisting only of 'A' and 'B'.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - For each string, two counters `l` and `h` are initialized to 0. These counters are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
   - The program iterates through each character in the string. If the character is 'A', it increments `l`. If the character is 'B', it increments `h`.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in a string, the program compares the values of `l` and `h`.
   - If `l` is greater than `h`, it prints 'A', indicating that 'A' appears more frequently in the string.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B', indicating that 'B' appears more frequently or that 'A' and 'B' appear with the same frequency (in which case, the problem implicitly specifies that 'B' should be chosen).

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the result for each test case on a new line, as specified in the problem statement.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the first test case with the string "ABABB":
- `l` is incremented 3 times (for each 'A').
- `h` is incremented 2 times (for each 'B').
- Since `l > h`, the program correctly outputs 'A'.

This logic is consistently applied to all test cases, ensuring that the correct character is printed for each string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required functionality and handles the provided test cases as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
