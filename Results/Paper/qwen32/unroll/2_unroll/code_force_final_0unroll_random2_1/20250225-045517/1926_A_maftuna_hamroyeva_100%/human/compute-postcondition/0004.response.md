Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a 5-character string consisting only of 'A' and 'B'. It then outputs 'A' if 'A' appears more frequently in the string, otherwise it outputs 'B'. The values of `t` and the input strings remain unchanged after the function executes.**
