You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be either 'A' or 'B', depending on which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in the respective 5-character string. If 'A' appears more times, 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed. The value of `t` and the distinct 5-character strings remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a 5-character string consisting only of 'A' and 'B'. It then outputs 'A' if 'A' appears more frequently in the string, otherwise it outputs 'B'. The values of `t` and the input strings remain unchanged after the function executes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program is designed to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in a string of length 5 for multiple test cases. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `t` times.
3. For each iteration, it reads a string `a` of length 5.
4. It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. `l` is used to count the occurrences of 'A', and `h` is used to count the occurrences of 'B'.
5. It iterates through each character in the string `a`. If the character is 'A', it increments `l` by 1; otherwise, it increments `h` by 1.
6. After counting, it compares the values of `l` and `h`. If `l` is greater than `h`, it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

The logic of the program is correct according to the problem statement. It counts the occurrences of each character and correctly identifies which character appears more frequently. Since the problem guarantees that all strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', the program handles all valid inputs correctly.

Correctness: **True**
