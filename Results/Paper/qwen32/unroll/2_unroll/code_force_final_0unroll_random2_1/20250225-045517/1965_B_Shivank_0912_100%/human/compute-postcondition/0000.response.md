Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `k` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer input by the user, while the conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are described in the problem statement and have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
