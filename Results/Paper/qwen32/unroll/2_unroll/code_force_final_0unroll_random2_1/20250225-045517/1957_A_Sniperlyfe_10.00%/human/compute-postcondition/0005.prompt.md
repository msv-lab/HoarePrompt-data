You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing stick lengths. The function returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 4.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
