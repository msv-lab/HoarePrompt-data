You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k distinct integers in increasing order where 1 <= k <= 100 and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and each element n_i in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list `b` which contains q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and each element n_i in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of k distinct integers in increasing order where 1 <= k <= 100 and each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, and `b`, a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and each element `n_i` in `b` satisfies 1 <= `n_i` <= 100. If the function follows Case_1, it returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`. If the function follows Case_2, it returns the list `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.

Case_2: The program returns the list `b` which contains q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and each element n_i in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
