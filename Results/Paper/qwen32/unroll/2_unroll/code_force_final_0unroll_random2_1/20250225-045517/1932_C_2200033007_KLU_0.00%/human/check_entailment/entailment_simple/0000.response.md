Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in how the product of the array elements is calculated and outputted.

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The function `func_1` constructs a list `b` by picking elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. However, it then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and outputs these products. This does not match the problem's requirement to output the product of all remaining elements in the array `a` at each step, before removing an element based on the command.

2. **Removal of Elements**: The problem requires that after calculating the product of all elements in the current array `a`, the leftmost or rightmost element is removed based on the command. The current implementation does not maintain the original array `a` and instead constructs a new list `b` which is not used correctly for the product calculation as required.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The problem specifies that the product should be taken modulo `m` at each step. The current implementation does not apply the modulo operation at each step of the product calculation.

To correct the program:
- We need to keep the original array `a` and calculate the product of all its elements at each step.
- Apply the modulo operation `m` to the product at each step.
- Remove the appropriate element from the array `a` based on the command.
- Output the result of the modulo operation for each step.

Given these issues, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
