### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It reads the array `a` of length `n`.
   - It reads the string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements in the order they are removed.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - It iterates over the commands in the string `s`.
     - If the command is 'L', it appends `a[l]` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends `a[r]` to `b` and decrements `r`.

3. **Calculating the Product Remainders:**
   - The function then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
   - However, it does not take the remainder of the product at each step. Instead, it calculates the product and then takes the remainder of the final product. This is incorrect because the problem requires the remainder of the product at each step.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainders:**
  - The program does not take the remainder of the product at each step. It only calculates the product and then takes the remainder of the final product.
  - This approach can lead to incorrect results due to integer overflow and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach

To fix the program, we need to take the remainder of the product at each step:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            p = (p * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            p = (p * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the remainders of the product at each step. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the program. The program needs to take the remainder of the product at each step to produce the correct output.
