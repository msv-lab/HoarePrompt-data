Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap

The task is to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` of length `n` and a positive integer `m`. For each command, we need to:
1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` when divided by `m`.
2. Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L', or the rightmost element if the command is 'R'.

### Provided Program Analysis

Here's the provided code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

### Function Summary Recap

The function `func_1`:
- Constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`.
- Computes the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
- Returns the cumulative product list in reverse.

### Issues Identified in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program constructs `b` by selecting elements based on the commands but does not compute the product of the current state of `a` at each step.
   - It calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program does not compute the remainder of the product of the current state of `a` when divided by `m` at each step.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The output is not the remainders of the product of the current state of `a` when divided by `m` at each step.

### Corrected Program

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        ans.append(product % m)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * a.pop(0)) % m
        else:
            product = (product * a.pop()) % m
    return ans
```

### Explanation

- **Product Calculation**:
  - The corrected program calculates the product of the current state of `a` at each step.
  - It uses the modulo operation to ensure the product does not exceed the limits and remains manageable.
  
- **Output**:
  - The remainders of the product of the current state of `a` when divided by `m` at each step are appended to the `ans` list and returned.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the corrected version addresses these issues.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
