Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It reads the array `a` of length `n`.
   - It reads the string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and output the remainders.
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements in the order they are removed.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - It iterates over the commands in the string `s`.
     - If the command is 'L', it appends `a[l]` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends `a[r]` to `b` and decrements `r`.

3. **Calculating the Product Remainders:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to calculate the product.
   - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order (since the elements were removed from the original array in the order they appear in `b`).
   - For each element `v` in `reversed(b)`, it multiplies `p` by `v` and appends `p` to `ans`.
   - It returns `reversed(ans)` to ensure the remainders are in the correct order.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainders:**
  - The program does not take the remainder of the product at each step. It only calculates the product and then takes the remainder of the final product.
  - The correct approach is to take the remainder of the product at each step to avoid overflow and ensure the correct result.

### Correct Approach

To fix the program, we need to take the remainder of the product at each step:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            p = (p * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            p = (p * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the remainders of the product at each step. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
