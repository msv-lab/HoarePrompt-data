### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem, the provided code, and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers. Anna reverses the digits of one element, and Sasha concatenates two elements. The game ends when only one number remains in the list. Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**: This function calculates the total length of the numbers in the list after accounting for trailing zeros and determines the winner based on this value.
2. **`zerocnts(num)`**: This function counts the trailing zeros in the string representation of a number.

#### Function Summaries:
- **`zerocnts(num)`**: Correctly counts the trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.

#### Issues with the Code:
1. **Anna's Move**: The code does not simulate Anna's move of reversing the digits of an element. Instead, it only considers the count of trailing zeros. Reversing the digits and removing leading zeros is not implemented.
2. **Sasha's Move**: The code does not simulate Sasha's move of concatenating two numbers. It only calculates the total length of the numbers and subtracts the trailing zeros.
3. **Game Logic**: The code does not correctly determine the winner based on the value of the final number. It checks if the total length minus trailing zeros is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), which is not a correct way to determine the winner.

#### Counterexample:
For the input:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
- Anna can reverse either 14 to 41 or 2 to 2.
- If Anna reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\).
- If Anna reverses 2 to 2, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\).
- In both cases, Sasha wins.

The code will not correctly simulate the game and will likely output "Anna" for this input, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules and logic described in the problem statement. The code fails to simulate Anna's move of reversing digits and Sasha's move of concatenating numbers, leading to incorrect winner determination.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
