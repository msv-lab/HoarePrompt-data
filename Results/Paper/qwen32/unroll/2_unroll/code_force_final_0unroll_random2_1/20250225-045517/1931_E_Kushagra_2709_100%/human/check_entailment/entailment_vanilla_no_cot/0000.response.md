Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Counting Leading Zeros**: The function `zerocnts` is intended to count trailing zeros in the number, not leading zeros. However, the problem requires reversing the digits of the number, which would involve removing leading zeros after reversing, not counting them.

2. **Logic for Winning Condition**: The main logic in `func_1` is flawed. The approach of subtracting counts of trailing zeros (incorrectly counted as leading zeros) from the total length of digits is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The critical point is not the number of zeros but the ability to form a number that meets or exceeds \(10^m\) through optimal moves.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**: The program does not account for the optimal play strategy for both players. The key aspect is that Sasha wins if he can form a number that is at least \(10^m\) after Anna's turn. The provided program does not simulate the moves or consider the strategic implications of each move.

To correctly solve the problem, one should simulate or analyze the game's moves and consider the optimal strategies for both players. This includes understanding that Sasha can always concatenate numbers to increase the number's size, while Anna can only reverse digits, which might not significantly increase the number's size if the digits are already in a large configuration.

Thus, the given program is incorrect and does not provide the correct solution for the described problem.
