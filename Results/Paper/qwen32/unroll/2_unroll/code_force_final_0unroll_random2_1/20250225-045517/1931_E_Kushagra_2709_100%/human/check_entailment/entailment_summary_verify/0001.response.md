### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers. Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number, while Sasha concatenates two numbers. The game ends when only one number remains. Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Anna's Move**: Reversing a number does not change the total number of digits in the list.
2. **Sasha's Move**: Concatenation of two numbers reduces the list size by one and can potentially create a number with a large number of digits.

#### Strategy:
- The game's outcome depends on the total number of digits in the list after Anna's moves.
- If the total number of digits is at least \(m+1\), Sasha can concatenate numbers to form a number with at least \(m+1\) digits, thus winning the game.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`: This correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list.
   - `cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`: This calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts these counts in descending order.
   - `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`: This loop subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total number of digits for every second number in the sorted list of trailing zeros. This logic is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that trailing zeros are removed in a way that affects the total digit count.
   - `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`: This checks if the adjusted total number of digits is at least \(m+1\).

2. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.

#### Issues with the Code:
The core issue with the code lies in the logic for adjusting the total number of digits by subtracting trailing zeros for every second number. This logic is not supported by the problem constraints. Leading zeros are removed when reversing numbers, but there's no indication that trailing zeros are removed during concatenation.

#### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the winner. The subtraction of trailing zeros for every second number is unjustified and can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
