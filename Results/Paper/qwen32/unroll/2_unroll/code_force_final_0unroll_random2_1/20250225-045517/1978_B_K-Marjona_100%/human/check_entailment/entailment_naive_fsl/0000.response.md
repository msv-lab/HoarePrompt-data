Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. We need to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Case when `b <= a`:**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing `a * n`.

2. **Case when `b > a`:**
   - The program calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at modified prices is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

### Checking Edge Cases:
1. **When `n = 1`:**
   - If `b > a`, `k` will be 1, and the profit will be `b`.
   - If `b <= a`, the profit will be `a`.
   - Both cases are correctly handled by the program.

2. **When `b = a`:**
   - The program correctly handles this by selling all buns at the usual price `a`.

3. **When `b - a < n`:**
   - The program correctly calculates `k` as `b - a` and computes the profit accordingly.

4. **When `b - a >= n`:**
   - The program correctly calculates `k` as `n` and computes the profit accordingly.

5. **Large Values:**
   - The program handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` correctly due to the use of integer arithmetic.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and checking various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly computes the maximum profit for all potential cases as per the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `b <= a`, `b > a`, and when `b - a` is less than or greater than `n`. It also efficiently computes the profit for large values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
